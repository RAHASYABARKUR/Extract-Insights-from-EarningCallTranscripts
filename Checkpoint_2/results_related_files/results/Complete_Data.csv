0,apple,q1,2018,"Prepared Remarks:OperatorGood day and welcome to this Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.I'd like to remind you that the quarter we're reporting today included 13 weeks, whereas the quarter we reported a year ago included 14 weeks.
Our teams carried out an extremely complex launch from both an engineering and operations perspective, executing an outstanding product ramp that required years of research and development.
Sales of Apple Watch Series 3 models were also more than twice the volume of Series 2 a year ago.
We sold 13.2 million units with average iPad sales per week up 8% over last year's December quarter.
Intesa Sanpaolo will deploy native apps to improve employee productivity in customer support, human resources, and marketing across the company.At LensCrafters, one of the largest optical retail brands in North America, will be using over 7,000 iPad Pros to enable digital eye exams and digital optical measurements in a personalized, interactive experience.We're also rolling out a new initiative called Apple At Work to help businesses implement employee-choice programs more easily and offer Apple products company wide.
We launched a new $5 billion-dollar ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 23.6 million shares, and we'll retire 3.8 million shares upon the completion of our 12th ASR during the quarter.We have now completed over 248 billion of our 300 billion capital return program including 176 billion in share repurchases against our announced 210 billion buyback program with 34 billion remaining under our current authorization.Turning to taxes, due to the recently enacted legislation in the US, we estimate making a corporate income tax payment of approximately $38 billion to the US government on our accumulative past foreign earnings.
Thank you for your participation.Duration: 61 minutesCall participants:Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsTimothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerLuca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerShannon S.
After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.Please not that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook.
It's also fueling tremendous growth in our services business, which I'll talk about a little later in the call.Turning to the December quarter, we're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings.
Our customers love these new features, and the new gestures like simply swiping up from the bottom, which made using iPhone even more intuitive and enjoyable.Our team has put the technology of tomorrow in our customers' hands today, set the standard for the next decade of smartphones, and we are very proud of their achievements.It was another very strong quarter for services, with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 18% over last year, and we're on pace to achieve our goal of doubling our 2016 services revenue by 2020.
Together with Apple Music, HomePod gives you instant access to one of the world's largest music catalogs, and with the intelligence of Siri, it's a powerful assistant you control through natural voice interaction.We're very happy with the initial response from reviewers who experienced HomePod ahead of its launch, and we think our customers are going to love this new product.We believe one of the key issues of the 21st century is education, and because of that, we've strengthened our commitment and investment into initiatives like Everyone Can Code.
When we look at average revenue per week, our growth rate was even higher at 21% with growth across all product categories for the third consecutive quarter.Our results were terrific all around the world, with double-digit revenue growth in all our geographic segments, and all-time quarterly records in the vast majority of markets we track including the US, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and Korea, as well as mainland China, Latin America, the Middle East, central and eastern Europe, and India.
We established all-time iPhone revenue records in nearly every market we track and double-digit growth in all of our geographic segments.iPhone ASP increased to $796, from $695 a year ago, driven primarily by the launch of iPhone X and the success of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.We exited the December quarter toward the lower end of our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory, with less than 1 million less iPhones in the channel compared to the December quarter a year ago, in line with our goals in average weekly unit sales.Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very, very strong for both consumers and business users.
Among business customers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 77% plan to purchase iPhone.Our customers are also incredibly loyal, with Kantar's latest US research reflecting a 96% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured.Turning to services, we had a terrific quarter with revenue of 8.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year, and up 27% in terms of average revenue per week.
That is an acceleration to the 24% services growth run rate that we experienced in the September quarter.The App Store set a new all-time revenue record.
During the week beginning December 24, a record number of customers made purchases or downloaded apps from the app store, spending over 890 million in that 7-day period, followed by 300 million in purchases on New Year's Day alone.According to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases by a very wide margin, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play.Across all of our services offerings, paid subscriptions reached 240 million with growth of 58% over last year, and they were a major contributor to the overall strong growth in services revenue.As Tim mentioned, it was our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, and when we add the results from Beats and AirPods, our total revenue from wearables was up almost 70% year-over-year.
In fact, wearables were the second-largest contributors to revenue growth after iPhone, which is impressive for a business that started only three years ago.In total, our Other Products category set a new all-time record with quarterly revenue exceeding $5 billion for the first time.Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.1 million Macs during the December quarter, which translates to a 2% year-over-year increase in average sales per week.
On a worldwide basis, the active installed base of Macs was up double-digits year-over-year to a new record.It was also another growth quarter for iPad. iPad sales drew strong double-digits in many emerging markets including Latin America, the Middle East, central and eastern Europe, and India, as well as developed markets including Japan, Australia, and Korea.The active installed base of iPad has grown every quarter since its launch in 2010, and it reached a new all-time high in December thanks to extremely high customer loyalty and large numbers of first-time iPad users.NPD indicates that iPad has 46% share of the US tablet market in the December quarter, up from 36% share a year ago, and the most recent surveys from 451 Research found that among customers planning to purchase tablets within 90 days, 72% of consumers and 68% of business users plan to purchase iPads.
Traffic was particularly strong during the full weeks following the launch of iPhone X, up 46% over last year, and across the quarter, our stores conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple sessions covering topics including photography, music, gaming and app development, and art and design.Just last weekend, we opened our first store in Seoul, Korea, and we're looking forward to opening our first store in Austria in a few weeks.
Including the 38 billion payment, we will have paid over $110 billion of corporate income tax on our total domestic and foreign earnings during the last 10 years, for a cash tax rate of about 26%.Our tax rate of 25.8% for the December quarter was close to our guidance of 25.5% at the lower US pass-through rate from the new legislation was effectively offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax balances.As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
We will provide an update to our specific capital allocation plans when we report results for our second fiscal quarter consistent with the timing of our updates that we have provided in the past.Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable on February 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2018.With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director Investor RelationsThank you, Luca.
I realize you don't want to give us any specifics about what you're actually going to return and the timing, but just maybe if you could talk about how much cash I guess you think you need to have to run the business, and then in terms of ongoing cash flow, since the overseas cash will no longer be encumbered, does that change your thought process in general?
As I said earlier, we will be discussing capital allocation plans when we review our March quarter results, and when you look at our track record of what we've done over the last several years, you've seen that effectively we were returning to our investors essentially about 100% of our free cash flow.
The revenue growth from iPhone across all the geographic segments was in the double digits, and I think as Luca said earlier, when you change that to an average weekly sales basis, it's actually 22%.
Growing double digits off such a large revenue base is impressive in itself, but if I look at March quarter guidance, it does assume a slower average weekly growth in total revenue as well as I think, my math, I found shipments when you compare it to the December quarter.
This is at the macro level.We typically don't go into this level of detail, but think it's important this quarter to give you additional color, and maybe the two most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as compared to last year during the March quarter, and also and importantly that iPhone sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis, would be actually accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December quarter.Let me explain the factors that we took into consideration as we came up with our iPhone units and AHD that are embedded into our guidance.
Certainly, weaker dollar in the long term if it holds, will be a positive, but it's not something that you're gonna be seeing translate into gross margin tailwind quickly, and so I think we have to keep that in mind.We also need to keep in mind that we continue to experience a difficult memory tracking environment, which we think is gonna start improving as we move into the second half of our fiscal year, but it still has a negative impact in the March quarter.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director Investor RelationsThank you, Katy.
And then, believe it or not, I have a follow-up.Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer I think it's up to investors as to what things they would like to focus on, so I don't wanna put myself in the position of that.
You often give us switchers.Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerIt is so early on this product cycle, particularly with the iPhone X only starting in November, that we do not feel we have data at this point that would be very meaningful to share, and so I'll punt that question until next time around.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Laura.

We had all-time record revenue from the app store from Apple Music, from iCloud, from Apple Pay, and more, all of which are a powerful illustration of the importance of our huge active installed base of devices and the loyalty and engagement of our customers.Across all our services, paid subscriptions surpassed 270 million, up over 100 million from a year ago, and up 30 million in the last 90 days alone, contributing to the overall increase in services revenue.
With the launch of Brazil in April, Apple Pay is now available in 21 markets, and we expect Norway, Poland, and Ukraine to launch in the next several months.This was another outstanding quarter for our wearables business, which includes Apple Watch, Beats, and AirPods, with combined revenue of almost 50% year-over-year.
It's currently available in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, and we're looking forward to adding new features to HomePod and introducing it to more markets around the world soon.In March, we announced new products for the education community, including updating our most popular iPad with support for Apple Pencil.
During the quarter, we sold 52.2 million iPhones, up 3% over last year, and we grew iPhone units by double digits in several markets, including Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico, and Vietnam.
And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPhones.Turning to services, we had a sensational quarter, with all-time record revenue of $9.2 billion.
And that's up more than $2 billion from last year, an increase of 31%, and double the services revenue we generated in the March quarter just four years ago.
When we combined all our wearables and home products, they accounted for over 90% of the total growth in the other products category.Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac, which set a new March quarter revenue record, including new records in both the Americas and Greater China.
Year-over-year growth was led by iPhone, as well as strong performance from AirPods and the introduction of HomePod. During the quarter, we opened beautiful new stores in South Korea and in Austria, our first in both countries, and three weeks ago, we opened our newest store in Tokyo, bringing us to 502 stores across the world today.Let me now turn to our cash position.
As we said in February, our goal is to become approximately net cash neutral over time.Given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value that we see in our stock, our board has authorized a new $100 billion share repurchase program, which we will start executing during the June quarter.
With over $13 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be among the largest dividend payers in the world, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward.We will continue to review our capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, our investment opportunities, and our financial outlook.
We expect to provide a new update to our capital allocation plans approximately 12 months from now.As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
Given the $1,000.00 price point, and it's clearly selling, but there's been a lot of questions in the market about the sustainability of that price point and how you're thinking about it as you look out sort of holistically across your lineup.
I think that our iPhone line shows that there's a variety of different customers in a market that is as large as the smartphone market, and so we're going to continue to provide different iPhones for folks to meet their needs.On iPhone X specifically, I think it's important to maybe emphasize again one of the things I mentioned in my opening comments, that customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each and every week in the March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter.
What's driving that, and how are you thinking about -- I mean, it's one of the uses of cash, obviously, so how are you thinking about inventory and maybe working capital in general as you're going forward?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
And so, that's our focus, and I'm optimistic that -- I don't know every play by play that will happen, but over time, I think that view will prevail.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Katy.
And I think the other good news is that because our active installed base is at such a level that -- last quarter we said that we'd exceeded 1.3 billion.
But we believe that given where we are with the valuation of the stock, we think that we continue to do the buyback primarily.We are not giving an end date to the program this time because the amount is very, very large, and so, we will try to execute it -- as you've seen from our track record during the last five years, we will do it at a very fast pace, but we also want to do it efficiently.
And I have a follow-up for Luca, please.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerWe price for the value that we're delivering, and iPhone X is the most innovative product on the market.
iPhone's second quarter performance capped a tremendous fiscal first half, with $100 billion in iPhone revenue, an increase of $12 billion over last year, setting a new first half record and achieving our highest first half growth rate in three years.iPhone gained share during the quarter based on IDC's latest estimates for the global smartphone market.
Looking at its revenue over the last four quarters, our wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 300 company.Apple Watch had another great quarter, with revenue growing by strong double digits year-over-year to a new March quarter record.
We believe education is the great equalizer, and whether it's through our coding programs, our unrivaled augmented reality platform, or the creativity both can unleash, we're proud to help students everywhere reach new frontiers of learning with Apple technology.In March, we also released iOS 11.3, a major update offering new immersive augmented reality experiences, access to personal health records in the Health app, and more.
We're narrowing the site selection for a new U.S. campus, and we look forward to sharing more information on that later this year.Consistent with our annual cadence, today we're providing an update on our capital return program.
Tax reform makes it possible for us to execute our program more efficiently, both through share repurchases and payment of dividend to the tens of millions of investors who own Apple stock either directly or indirectly, from large pension funds to individuals with a retirement account.
Our Board of Directors has approved a new $100 billion share repurchase authorization, as well as a 16% in our quarterly dividend, effective with our next dividend payable later this month.Luca will provide more details about our program, as well as a more in-depth discussion of the quarter's results.
Performance was very strong in emerging markets, where revenue was up 20%, and we were especially pleased to see 21% year-over-year growth in Greater China, our strongest growth rate from that segment in ten quarters.
Diluted earnings per share were $2.73, up 30% to our new record for Q2, and cash flow from operations was very strong, at $15.1 billion.iPhone revenue grew 14% year-over-year, with iPhone ASP increasing to $728.00 from $655.00 a year ago, driven primarily by the performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus.
Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was even stronger than our reported results, as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.8 million units, 600,000 units more than the March quarter reduction last year.
We were happy to see double-digit growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high, with almost 60% of March quarter purchases coming from customers who are new to Mac.iPad grew both units and revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter.
We are thrilled that insurance industry leaders recognized that Apple products provide superior security.In March, we announced two new services with IBM to bring more dynamic and intelligent insights into apps.
In fact, HCA Healthcare recently announced they plan to deploy 100,00 iPhones across their hospital sites within the next three years.We had great performance from our retail and online stores, which produced their highest March quarter revenue ever.
As in the past, we will provide regular updates on our capital return activities at the end of every quarter.We're also raising our dividend for the sixth time in less than six years, as we know it is very important to our investors who value income.

2,apple,q3,2018,"Today we're proud to report our best June quarter revenue and earnings ever thanks to the strong performance of iPhone services and wearables.
Based on the latest data from IDC, iPhone grew faster than the global smartphone market-gaining share in many markets including the US, greater China, Canada, Germany, Australia, Russia, Mexico, and the Middle East and Africa.Second, we had a stellar quarter in services, which generated an all-time record revenue of 9.5 billion fueled in part by double-digit growth in our overall active installed base.
Apple Pay Cash, our peer-to-peer payment service, is already serving millions of customers across the US, less than eight months following its launch.Our third highlight of the quarter is the outstanding results in wearables, which comprises Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats, and was up over 60% year-over-year with growth accelerating from the March quarter.
IPhone revenue grew 20% year-over-year with iPhone ASP increasing to $724 from $606 a year ago driven by the strong performance of iPhone 10, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus across the world.During the quarter, we saw 41.3 million iPhones with double-digit unit growth in several markets including the US, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico, Hong Kong, Russia, the Middle East, and Africa.
We generated double-digit services growth in all of our geographic segments and the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Music, Cloud services, and Apple Pay, all set new June quarter records.Our Other Product category all set a new record for the June quarter with revenue of over 3.7 billion, that's up 37% from last year with great sales momentum for both Apple Watch and AirPods.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.We were very happy to see double-digit year-over-year growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high with nearly 60% of purchases during the quarter coming from customers who are new to Mac. MPD indicates that iPad is a 60% share of the US tablet market in the June quarter up from 51% share a year ago.
We repurchased 20 billion worth of Apple shares, of which 10 billion related to the completion of our previous 210 billion buyback program and 10 billion to the beginning of the new 100 billion authorization we announced three months ago for a total of 112.8 million shares repurchased through open market transactions during the quarter.As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
And the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Music, Cloud services, Apple Pay, all set new June quarter records and of course subscriptions have now passed 300 million, as I had mentioned before.
So we feel pretty good about also the guidance for the fourth quarter.Looking forward, we don't provide guidance beyond the cutting quarter but I think you know we have a pretty good record over the last several years to make good business decisions balancing units, revenue, and margins.
And then I have a follow-up.Tim Cook ­-- Chief Executive OfficerShannon, we feel great about the results on iPhone, up 20%, and if you look for the cycle -- and by the cycle I mean Q1, Q2, and Q3, we've had on an average weekly basis growth and units of mid-single-digit and ASP growth of double-digit.
There is a fourth tariff which includes goods valued at 200 billion, also focused on goods that are imported from China -- that one is out for public comment, probably like everyone else we're evaluating that one and we'll be sharing our views of it with the administration and so forth before the comet period for that one is.It's actually a tedious process in going through it because you not only have to analyze the revenue products, which are a bit more straightforward to analyze, but you also have to analyze the purchases that you're making through other companies that are not related to revenue, maybe they're related to data centers and this sort of thing.
We're seeing the things that we have on the periphery of this like Apple TV units and revenue grew by very strong double-digits in Q3.
In terms of our installed base, which is something very important for us, as it is one of the key drivers of services, our active installed base on iPhone grew double-digits over last year during the quarter.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other incumbent expense, taxes, capital allocation, share repurchases, dividends, and future business outlook.Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.
Paid subscriptions from Apple and third parties have now surpassed 300 million, an increase of more than 60% in the past year alone.Revenue from subscriptions accounts for a significant and increasing percentage of our overall services business.
The app store turned ten years old this month and we set a new June quarter revenue record.
Our communication services are experiencing record usage.We've hit all-time highs for both the number of monthly active users of messages and the number of FaceTime calls made with growth accelerating from the March to June quarters.
Apple Pay continues to expand with well over 1 billion transactions last quarter, triple the amount from just a year ago with growth accelerating for the March quarter.To put that tremendous growth into perspective, this past quarter we completed more total transactions than great companies like Square and more mobile transactions than PayPal. Apple Pay is now live in 24 markets worldwide with over 4,900 bank partners and we look forward to adding Germany later this year.We're excited to share that in the US, eBay is beginning to enable its sellers to accept Apple Pay and CVS Pharmacy and 7-11 will roll out Apple Pay acceptance in locations nationwide this fall.
Developer and customer reaction has been very positive and we have over 4 million users participating in our new OS beta programs.Starting with iOS12, Siri will take a major step forward with Siri shortcuts, which deliver a new, much faster way to get things done and allow any app to work with Siri.
Apple Watch will become an even stronger companion for fitness, communication and quick access to information, with features including new workouts, activity sharing competitions, auto workout detection, advanced running features, walkie-talkie, podcast, and third-party apps on the Siri watch face.For Apple TV, we've seen major growth in sales since the introduction of Apple TV 4K last fall as video providers around the world choose Apple TV 4K to deliver their subscription services.
Later this year, charter communications will begin offering Apple TV 4K to its customers in nearly 50 million US households providing access to live channels and tens of thousands of on-demand programs via the Spectrum TV app on Apple TV 4K, iPhone, and iPad. And tvOS will take the cinematic experience of Apple TV 4K to the next level this fall with support for Dolby Atmos audio and new features to easily find popular shows and movies.
And among business buyers who plan to purchase iPhones in the September quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones up 3 points from the last survey.Turning to services, we had our best results ever with all-time record revenue of $9.5 billion.
Even with the difficult launch comparison, we saw great momentum in many emerging markets with growth well into double-digits and we established new June quarter records for Mac sales in India, Turkey, Chile, and Central and Eastern Europe.IPad unit sales grew from the fifth consecutive quarter and we gained significant share of the global tablet market based on the latest estimates from IDC.
Almost half of iPad purchases in the quarter were by customers new to IPad and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high.Our overall performance compared to last year was impacted by the introduction of new iPad Pro models in June of last year which resulted in both a different mix with higher ASPs in China fill a year ago.
And companies tell us that Mac has been instrumental in helping them attract and retain talent while providing strong security, streamlined deployment workflow, and significantly lower total cost of ownership.We're also seeing great interest in Business Chat, our powerful new way for organizations to connect with customers.
Business Chat lets customers get answers to questions, resolve issues, and complete transactions directly from within Messages by starting a conversation on their iPhone or IPad and even continue the conversation on their Mac or Apple Watch.
Apple's smartphone iPhone units have been relatively flat for four years and I think you've probably been a share gainer during the period, which would suggest at least at the high end the market that is perhaps flat to down.

3,apple,q4,2018,"With the recent addition of beautiful new stores in Italy, Japan, China and in just a few weeks Thailand, we will have 506 stores where we can further those relationships, almost half of which are outside the United States.Before I turn the call over to Luca, I'd like to touch on two items that may not show up in our financial statement but are just as integral to Apple's mission and our commitment to making the world a better place.
Luca?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tim. We are extremely pleased to report the record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic segments and established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter.Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year, with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific.
In fact, 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available on the App Store today and the largest of them all represents less than 0.3% of our total services revenue.Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. At over 100 million units, our active installed base of Mac is at an all-time high and the majority of customer purchasing Macs in the September quarter were new to Mac.We sold 9.7 million iPads during the quarter, gaining share in nearly every market we track, based on the latest estimates from IDC.
And among business customers, who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter, 74% plan to purchase iPads.Other Products revenue grew 31% to a new September quarter record, with an increase of over $1 billion compared to a year ago.
Thanks to wearables growth of over 50% and the strong performance of Apple TV, in addition to the introduction of HomePod earlier this year.As we look back across fiscal 2018, we have made great progress in the enterprise market where iOS is transforming our business gets done across multiple industries.
And we returned a total of almost $90 billion to our investors during the year, including almost $14 billion in dividends and equivalents and over $73 billion in share repurchases.Before we discuss our December quarter outlook, I'd like to describe a number of changes in our financial reporting that we are implementing as we enter our new fiscal year.
First, given the increased importance of our Services business and in order to provide additional transparency to our financial results, we will start reporting revenue as well as cost of sales for both total products and total services beginning this December quarter.
Third, starting the December quarter, we will no longer be providing unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and Mac.As we have stated many times, our objective is to make great products and services that enrich people's lives and to provide an unparalleled customer experience so that our users are highly satisfied, loyal, and engaged.
As we accomplish these objectives, strong financial results follow.As demonstrated by our financial performance in recent years, the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business.
So can you talk about how you see the trajectory there for the business and what you think of the initiatives of some companies like Netflix and Fortnite trying to bypass the App Store around subscriptions and I have a follow up.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerSure.
And when we look at the impact of foreign exchange on our revenue for the December quarter, we are looking at 200 basis points of headwinds, which translates given our, the size of our business to almost $2 billion of headwind to our revenue.The third point that I think it's important to keep in mind, and Tim has talked about this, we are launching -- in the last six weeks we've launched an unprecedented number of new products.
When you look at our financial performance in recent years, take the last three years for example, the number of units sold during any quarter has not been necessarily preventative of the underlying strength of our business,if you look at our revenue during the last three years, if you look at our net income during the last three years, if you look at our stock price in the last three years, there is no correlation to the units sold in any given period.As you know very well, in addition, our product ranges for all the major product categories become wider over time, and therefore a unit of sale is less relevant for us at this point compared to the past, because we got this much wider sales price dispersion.
But of course, we understand that this is something of interest and when we believe that providing qualitative commentary on unit sales offers additional relevant information to investors, we will do so.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerLet me make one additional point there, just for clarity, is that, Shannon, our intention is to continue to give revenue guidance at the company level and gross margin guidance in the other categories that we've been providing.
Thanks.Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerMike, as we said, during the September quarter we set new records for many, many services categories right from Apple Music to Cloud Services, to the App Store to AppleCare and Apple Pay really has an exponential trajectory right now.When we look at our services business, we think about the fact that we had a very large and growing installed base.
In terms of reporting results, one of the things that we're doing and it's new and it's an addition to the information that we provide to investors because we've heard some significant level of interest around this is starting with the December quarter for the first time, we are going to be providing information on revenue and cost of sales and therefore gross margins for both products and services.
And this will be the first time that we're going to provide gross margin information for our Services business which we believe it is an important metric for our investors to follow.I've given that the rationale and why we do not believe that providing unit sales is particularly relevant for our company at this point.
Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record, fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and 10 and the very successful launch of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever, with the industry's first 7 nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple design 8-core neural engine capable of executing an astounding five trillion operations per second.
And 10 months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest rated mobile peer-to-peer service by consumer reports, based on exceptional payment authentication and data privacy.We set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue.
The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4 has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by it's all new design, larger display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced cellular reception and electrical heart sensor.Later this year, the ECG app will be available to Apple Watch Series 4 customers in the US, giving them the ability to take an electric cardiogram anytime, right from their wrist.
This is a great example of how our commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive one's unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems and beautiful solutions that set us apart.I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018.
We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS and cash flow from operations.
As Tim mentioned, we reached new all-time quarterly revenue record for many services categories and we are well on our way to achieve our goal to double our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020.We now have over 330 million paid subscriptions on our platform, an increase of over 50% versus a year ago.
We saw great response to our new MacBook Pro models that we launched in July with strong double-digit revenue growth, driving an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue.
The companies will also provide tools and resources for millions of Salesforce developers to build their own native apps with the new Salesforce mobile SDK for iOS.And finally, we recently announced Apple Business Manager, a new way for IT teams to deploy Apple devices at scale.
We repurchased 92.5 million Apple shares for $19.4 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents.For our fiscal year 2018, revenue grew over $36 billion to $265.6 billion, an all-time record.
We also set new all-time records for net income up 23% versus last year and EPS up 29%.
Why aren't we seeing that flows through to margin expansion for the overall company?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYou are referring to the guidance that we provided for Q1, I imagine and --Kathryn Huberty -- Morgan Stanley & Co.

4,apple,q1,2019,"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook.
Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form Form 10-Q and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release.
We noted four factors that would impact our results when we provided guidance in November: different iPhone launch timing from a year ago, FX headwinds, supply constraints on certain products, and macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets.
So, I wanna share a bit more detail on the positives we see in China.We generated record December quarter services revenue in Greater China fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over two and a half million registered iOS developers.
We also continued to grow our total active installed base by adding new customers.
As a result, we estimate that less than half of iPhones sold in Japan in 1 of this year were subsidized compared to about three quarters a year ago and that the total value of those subsidies have come down as well.
And I'm very proud to say that nearly 16 years after launching the iTunes store, we generated our highest quarterly music revenue ever thanks to the great popularity of Apple Music now with over 50 million paid subscribers.
iPad revenue was up 17%, its highest growth rate in almost six years, powered by the new iPad Pro, released in November.
We also had our best quarter ever for wearables, home, and accessories with 33% growth in total and almost 50% growth from wearables thanks to strong sales above Apple Watch and AirPods.We don't measure our success in 90-day increments.
It's humbling to read emails from customers around the world telling us how Apple Watch has dramatically changed their lives by motivating them to be more fit and active, by alerting them to potentially serious health conditions, such as AFib, and by helping them in times of crisis with features like fall detection and emergency SOS.We believe we are just beginning to see the impact we can make to improving health and are deeply inspired by the possibilities.
On a sequential basis, product gross margin increased 60 basis points due to positive leverage from the holiday quarter partially offset by higher cost structures as we launched several new products and by headwinds from foreign exchange.
Services gross margin also increased 170 basis points, sequentially due to favorable mix and leverage, partially offset by foreign exchange.
On a geographic basis, most of the decline from last year came from Greater China and other emerging markets with difficult macro and foreign exchange conditions affected our results.
Many services categories set new all-time revenue records all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts growing by strong double-digits over last year.
We also had great results for iPad with revenue up 17% from a year ago and strong performance of both iPad and iPad Pro and generated double-digit growth in four of our five geographic segments.
And I'm wondering if you can comment about whether that's conservatism, whether you're entering the quarter with a high level of channel inventory -- and maybe you can comment explicitly on that -- or whether you actually think the macroeconomic conditions are getting worse.Luca Maestri -- Apple, Inc.
And maybe to that end, maybe you can help us understand what iPhones' average replacement cycle might be today, and how that may have changed over the last three to five years.
And so, depending on how these separate businesses do in the marketplace, we're gonna be seeing some level of movement going forward on services margins.But you've seen that for the last 12 months, they've gone up nicely 450 basis points.
And it's a wonderful customer experience.We've added Apple Music where we now have more than 50 million paid subscribers and continues to grow very nicely.
As you know, our December quarter revenue was below our original expectations, coming in at $84.3 billion.
Our revenue there was down by $4.8 billion from last year with declines across iPhone, Mac, and iPad. Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than we anticipated, our business grew outside of China, including new records in the Americas, western Europe, central and eastern Europe, and our rest of Asia-Pacific segment.
In fact, more than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during the December quarter were purchasing that product for the first time.
What's very important, however, is that in spite of these factors, our total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3 billion at the end of January of 2018 to 1.4 billion by the end of December reaching a new all-time high for each of the many product categories and for all five of our geographic segments.Not only is our large and growing install base a powerful testament to the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling our fast-growing services business.
In fact, services revenue set an all-time record of $10.9 billion in the December quarter, growing 19%.
We launched Apple Pay in three new countries in the December quarter: Germany, Belgium, and Kazakhstan.
Revenue from cloud services continues to grow rapidly with year-over-year revenue up over 40% in the December quarter.
The largest category represents less than 30% of total services revenue.And the new services we've launched in the last few years are all experiencing tremendous growth.
-- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tim. As Tim said, revenue for the December quarter was $84.3 billion.
Looking at proto categories, iPhone revenue declined 15% from a year ago where revenue from the rest of our business grew 19% to an all-time record, including our best results ever for services, for wearables, and for Mac. This quarter, for the first time, we're making an important new disclosure to our investors as we believe it will foster a better understanding of our business.We are now reporting on a quarterly basis gross margin for products in aggregate and for services in aggregate.
However, our global acting install base of iPhones continues to grow and has reached an all-time high at the end of December.
Turning to services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue of $10.9 billion, up 19% year-over-year with new December quarter records in all five of our geographic segments.
And it excludes the impact of the revenue reclassification between products and services we recorded in connection with ASC 606, the new revenue recognition accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal '19.
The number of transacting accounts on our digital stores reached a new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts growing by strong double-digits over last year.
And half of all the customers purchasing Macs in the December quarter were new to Mac. Similar to the Mac, our install base of iPads reached a new all-time high.And among customers purchasing iPads during the quarter, half were new to iPad. Revenue from this category was up over $1.8 billion compared to a year ago thanks to the amazing popularity of Apple Watch and AirPods, both of which were supply constrained as we exited the quarter.
Our retail and online stores generated strong results from Mac and iPad and all-time record performance from services and from wearables.Following the launch of the new iPhone trade-in campaign, our stores more than doubled the volume of iPhones traded in compared to last year, reaching an all-time high in Q1.
The second factor for the growth of the services business is that within this installed base, the percentage of users who are paying for at least one service is growing very strongly.
During the last few years, as you know, we've launched Apple Music, Apple Pay, an advertising service for our developers on the app store.
We're also looking to launch new services going forward that we believe will provide great value to our users.
I think an important point I need to make -- and I think it's helpful that you asked the question -- is that a portion of this deceleration is truly just a reclassification of the amortization of free services that we've made in connection with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
And by the way, when we report our March quarter results, we will also talk about the next step in our category return program which is something that we do traditionally in the spring.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Katie.
-- Chief Financial OfficerWell, Steve, we did mention on the call last quarter that the different timing our phone launches would affect the year-over-year compares.
I think you've seen that services gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by a significant amount.
Some of them tend to be accretive to the average gross margin for services, also because of the way we account for them -- for example, you know that on the app store, we book revenue on a net basis.
And then my second question is just when you think about growth in services, you have selling more to existing paid subscription customers or it's the 300 going to a half a billion.
",45.43,0.338919
5,apple,q2,2019,"I'll talk more about these categories later.While we grew year-over-year and developed markets and while we had record March quarter results in a number of major markets, including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Japan, we did experience a revenue decline in emerging markets.
Our year-over-year revenue performance in Greater China improved relative to the December quarter and we've seen very positive customer response to the pricing actions we've taken in that market, our trading and financing programs in our retail stores, the effects of government measures to stimulate the economy and improved trade dialog between the United States and China.
In fact, we had our best quarter ever for the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services and our App Store search ad business and we set new March quarter revenue records for AppleCare and Apple Pay. Apple Pay is now available in 30 markets and we expect to be live in 40 markets by the end of the year.
Everyone here is hard at work to prepare for WWDC and it's always a privilege to get to share the future of our platforms with the community of world-changing developers who bring it to live; you are not going to want to miss this one.We are in the fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business and it does confidently in our future.
For more details on that and our March quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tim. Revenue in the March quarter was $58 billion, near the high end of the guidance range that we provided 90 days ago, and down 5% from last year.
We're seeing positive customer response to recent pricing actions in certain emerging markets, as well as enhancements to our trade-in and financing programs and our year-over-year performance improved relative to our December quarter results in Greater China, in the Americas and in Japan.
And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones.Turning to Services, as Tim said, it was our best quarter ever with $11.5 billion in revenue, an increase of 16% from last year.
And across all third-party subscription apps, the largest accounted for only 0.3% of our total Services revenue.Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. On a global basis, nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac. And the active installed base of Macs reached a new all-time high.We had great results for iPad, reached $4.9 billion in revenue and growth accelerating from the December quarter to 22%.
We expect OI&E to be about $250 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%.Also reflecting the approved increase, today our Board of Directors has declared the cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock payable on May 16, 2019, to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2019.With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.Questions and Answers:Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Luca.
How much of that incremental is going in to support the new services that you're planning to launch later in the year?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes. Of course, we are supporting both our products and services business, and you can see the trajectory of our OpEx over the different quarters.
So it's a very important business for us in many ways, for our ecosystem and for our ability to monetize it and so clearly we will make all the necessary investments to ensure that the new services are successful and we're really encouraged by the level of customer response that we've received so far in anticipation for the launch of these services.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Samik.
It does from a customer user point of view, the trade-in looks like a subsidy, and so it is a way to offset the device cost itself and many people and literally every market that we've tried this in, there is a a reasonable number of people that want to take and pay for something on installments instead of all at once.
I think the key is, we're trying to build something into the consumer mindset that it's good for the environment and good for them to trade-in their current device on a new device and we do our best to getting the current device to someone else that can use that or in some cases, if the product is at an end of life, we are recycling the parts on it to make sure that it can carry on in another form.Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystThanks for the color, Tim. As part of this, we have agreed that we're not going to share the financial terms of the agreements, so we plan to honor that.
And then I have a follow?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. I wouldn't want to get into announcing things in the call, but obviously we're always working on new things.
Thank you.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerI think India is a very important market in the long-term.
After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook.
Thanks to our robust ecosystem, our talented developer community and the country's growing population of tech savvy consumers who value the very best products and services.For iPhone, while our worldwide revenue was down 17% from a year ago, declines were significantly smaller in the final weeks of the March quarter.
Importantly, our active installed base of devices continues to grow in each of our geographic segments and set a new all-time record for all major product categories.
And Ticketmaster has just announced that they will be accepting Apple Pay for ticket purchases on the web and through the Ticketmaster app and over 50 of their entertainment and sporting venues are launching contactless tickets this year, including the vast majority of NFL stadiums.Subscriptions are powerful driver of our Services business.
The app stores is already the world's biggest gaming platform and we think Apple Arcade is a great way to unleash the creativity of the game developer community with the collection of new games, not available on any other mobile platform or in any other subscription service.
But we believe that our Mac revenue would have been up compared to last year without those constraints and don't believe this challenge will have a significant impact on our Q3 results.For iPad, we were very happy to return to growth in Greater China, while generating strong double-digit growth in each of our other geographic segments.
Our great iPad results were driven primarily by strong customer response to iPad Pro. Late in the quarter, we launched in all new iPad Air with an ultra-thin design, Apple Pencil support and high-end performance powered by Apple's A12 Bionic chip.
In addition, we introduced a new iPad Mini, a major upgrade for iPad fans who love an ultra-portable design and like the new iPad Air it delivers the power of the A12 Bionic and support for Apple Pencil.Last month, we introduced new AirPods, the second generation of the world's most popular wireless headphones and demand has been incredible.
Overall products revenue declined 9% driven primarily by iPhone, while Services revenue grew 16% to a new all-time record.
Among customers who plan to purchase tablets, 77% of consumers and 75% of businesses plan to purchase iPads.Wearables, home and accessories revenue set a new March quarter revenue record of $5.1 billion, fueled primarily by the strong performance of our wearables business, which grew close to 50%.
Interest in AirPods has been off the charts and we're working hard to catch up with incredible customer demand.Turning to our retail and online stores, we generated very strong double-digit revenue growth from Apple Watch and iPad. We also announced 50 new Today at Apple sessions during the quarter in three new and expanded formats; Skills, Walks and Labs, free at our stores around the world.
Apple services are also making their way on board including growing adoption of Apple Pay for food and beverage purchases and in-flight access to Apple Music.We're also seeing significant iOS traction with large enterprise platforms, which are the face of complex backend systems to tens of millions of employees around the world.
Can we have the next question please?OperatorThe next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan -- AnalystHi. Do any of those learnings kind of carried through into how you decide pricing in the remaining emerging markets, like India, et cetera, as you get ready for the next product cycle?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerWe have made some adjustments in India, and we've seen preliminarily some better results there.
So can you just talk about which regions or product segment you think can outperform that typical seasonality?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes, Katy, and keep in mind, by the way, we are reporting this guidance including a 300 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange.

When you step back and consider wearables and services together, two areas where we have strategically invested in the last several years, they now approach the size of a Fortune 50 company.Geographically, we are happy with our performance across the board including, a return to growth in Mainland China.
Our active, installed base of iPhone reached a new all-time high and was up year-over-year in each of our top 20 markets, underscoring the quality of our products and the satisfaction and loyalty of iPhone customers around the world.Revenue excluding iPhone was up 17% from last year with growth across all categories.
Starting with services, we generated all-time record revenue of $11.5 billion, that's up 13% year-over-year and if we exclude the $236 million favorable one-time item from the June quarter last year, services growth was 15%, or 18% in constant currency, which is consistent with our Q2 performance.Our strong services performance was broad-based.
We surpassed 420 million paid subscriptions to services across our platform, and we remain on track to double our fiscal year 16 Services revenue in 2020.In May, we launched our all-new Apple TV app in over 100 countries, bringing together all the ways to watch TV in a single app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and select smart TVs. Monthly viewers in the Apple TV app in the United States are up over 40% year-over-year.
We had great results for Apple Watch, which set a new June quarter revenue record and is reaching millions of new users.
We continue to see phenomenal demand for AirPods, and when you tally up the last four quarters, our Wearables business is now bigger than 60% of the companies in the Fortune 500.We had great performance from iPad with revenue of over $5 billion and growth driven by iPad Pro, and by strong customer response to the new iPad mini and iPad Air. This was our third consecutive quarter of growth and with revenue up 15% year-to-date, we feel great about where we're headed with iPad. With our current lineup of iPad, iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro, we've got the perfect device for everyone from young learners to professionals.We were also very happy with double-digit revenue growth from Mac, fueled by a strong performance of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Looking forward, there is an enormous amount to be excited about for Mac. On the heels of our Mac Mini and iMac updates earlier in the fiscal year, we brought significant updates to the bulk of our notebook line up in the last couple of months.
Our developers are already running with these new technologies and we think our customers are going to love some of the apps these creators have in store in the months ahead.On so many fronts, there is an enormous amount to look forward to over the next few months, including the launch of new services, like Apple Arcade, Apple TV Plus, and Apple Card.
Product categories outside of iPhone grew 20%, with strong results in wearables, Mac, and iPad. Services revenue grew 13% to a new all-time record of $11.5 billion.
Excluding the one-time item we highlighted a year ago in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits, services revenue growth was 16%, and 18% in constant currency terms.On a geographic basis, we saw a marked improvement in our year-over-year comparisons from emerging markets relative to the first half of this fiscal year, particularly in the BRIC countries where year-over-year performance went from a 25% revenue decline in the first half to 3% growth in the June quarter.
In emerging markets, we returned to growth in Mainland China, grew strong double digits in India and in Brazil, and we set new Q3 records in Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.Company gross margin was 37.6%, flat sequentially, and in line with our guidance.
This was significantly better year-over-year performance than last quarter, 17% decline with sequential improvement in year-over-year comparisons in 15 of our top 20 markets.Our active installed base of iPhone continued to grow to a new all-time high in each of our geographic segments, and in the US, the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and XS Max combined.
Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 83% plan to purchase iPhones.Turning to services, we reached an all-time revenue record in spite of foreign exchange headwinds with double-digit growth from the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, and AppleCare, and triple-digit growth from Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business.
All geographic segments had double-digit growth in services revenue and set new June quarter records, with all-time records in the Americas and rest of Asia Pacific.
The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high in the June quarter, and the number of paid accounts grew strong double digits compared to last year.
Mac revenue grew in four of our five geographic segments, and set June quarter records in the US, Europe, and Japan, as our overall market performance significantly outpace the global PC industry.
Nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, with revenue growing in both developed and emerging markets and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all-time high.We also had great results for iPad with $5 billion in revenue, up 8%.
In addition, we generated double-digit revenue growth from Apple TV and Accessories during the quarter.Our retail and online stores produced our best June quarter revenue ever with double-digit revenue growth across Apple Watch, iPad, Mac and Accessories our trade-in program is showing great momentum with more than five times the number of iPhones traded in compared to a year ago.
We took some pricing action, we instituted our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores and worked with certain channel partners on that as well, and we are seeing a growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem during the quarter.And so when you look at it, each of our categories -- iPhone , iPad, Mac, wearables, services -- everything improved sequentially.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook.
Based on June quarter performance, Apple Pay is now adding more new users than PayPal, and monthly transaction volume is growing four times as fast.
For iPhone users, iOS 13 will take on a dramatic new look with dark mode, while delivering major updates to the apps you use every day including photos, camera, and maps.
iOS 13 offers great new ways to help you manage your privacy and security, including sign-on with Apple, which uses Face ID or Touch ID to quickly sign into apps and websites without sharing your personal information.
And improvements across the entire system will make iPhone even faster and more delightful to use than ever before.For the first time, iPad is getting its own version of iOS called iPadOS, a strategic step forward that takes the iPad experience to a whole new level.
The redesigned home screen, powerful new multitasking tools, and deeper integration with Apple Pencil take productivity and creativity further, including using your iPad as an extended an interactive second monitor for your Mac. For Apple TV, TvOS 13 will make the big screen experience even more personal.
WatchOS 6 includes powerful new features like notifications that warned about high-decibel noise to protect your hearing, and cycle tracking to aid in women's healthcare decisions.In the June quarter, we expanded the availability of the ECG app and irregular rhythm notifications to five additional European countries, and added Canada and Singapore just last week, making them available in 31 countries and regions around the world with more to come later this year.
A new tool included in Mac OS Catalina called Mac Catalyst gives developers a major head start in bringing their iOS apps to the Mac. And while providing these things, we've created a dynamic environment where a developer benefits benefit greatly from creating for, and distributing on these platforms.
In addition to our retail stores, that are over 1,800 third-party Apple Authorized Service Providers in the US, which is three times as many locations as three years ago.Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the June quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high.The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 94% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPads.
In the financial services industry, 90 of the largest 100 banks by asset size are deploying Apple products to improve efficiency and effectiveness across their organizations.iPhone and iPad are overwhelmingly the preferred mobile devices for bankers on the go.
Or do you think at some point down the road, those services will be independent by itself not really tied to your hardware installed base?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerWell, there are elements today that are not necessarily tethered to iPhone, right?
I don't want to go into the specific numbers, but I think you can see readily mathematically how the installed base is growing in an environment where the iPhone revenue is declining within a 90-day kind of window.Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd, Jim, on OpEx. What level of interest have you seen from developers and how are they thinking about the ability to monetize services independently on those App Stores?

The significant upswing in demand in the final part of the quarter is mirrored in the overwhelmingly positive reviews, customer feedback and in-store response we've seen for this new generation of devices, not to mention a wave of the best photos you've seen from a smartphone.iPhone 11 features the Apple-designed A13 Bionic the fastest most powerful chip ever in a smartphone plus an all new dual camera system and even longer all day battery life all wrapped in six great new colors.
They also produce the highest quality video in a smartphone supporting 4K video with extended dynamic range for more highlight detail and cinematic video stabilization.iOS 13 is driving user experience forward across the iPhone family with a bold new look in dark mode, major updates to the apps our customers use every day, such as photos and maps, new ways to help protect their privacy with sign-in with Apple and performance improvements across the entire system.For Services, revenue was $12.5 billion, that's up 18% over last year and it beats the previous record set in the June quarter by more than $1 billion.
We think these features appeal broadly to all iPhone customers, and we believe this has been the most successful launch of a credit card in United States ever.Last month, we launched Apple Arcade, our groundbreaking game subscription service offering an all new way for the whole family to enjoy games online or offline.
We introduce new services from Apple Card to Apple TV+ and generated over $46 billion in total services revenue, setting new yearly services records in all five of our geographic segments and driving our Services business to the size of a Fortune 70 company.We delivered incredible new hardware in all our device categories.
Products revenue was $51.5 billion, down 1% from last year, mainly due to iPhone, but largely offset by very strong performance from Wearables and iPad. Services revenue grew 18% to $12.5 billion, up over $1.9 billion year-over-year and almost $1.1 billion sequentially to a new all-time record with broad-based growth around the world and across our portfolio.On a geographic basis, we set new fourth quarter revenue records in our Americas and Rest of Asia Pacific segments.
We also saw continuous improvement in Greater China where year-over-year revenue comparisons became more favorable each quarter of fiscal 2019 from a 27% decline in the first quarter to a 2% decline in the fourth quarter.At a country level, we established new Q4 records in many major developed and emerging markets including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Korea, Singapore, Brazil, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.Company gross margin was 38%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue.
In total, services accounted for 20% of our revenue mix and 33% of our gross margin mix.Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with double-digit growth in paid accounts in all our geographic segments.
The new program complements our continued investment in our growing global network of over 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers the lead the industry for customer satisfaction and help millions of people with both in and out-of-warranty service for all Apple products.Next I would like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $7 billion, down 5% from last year due to a different mix of products, given the strength of our MacBook Air lineup and a difficult comparison to last year's launch of MacBook Pro models.
And among both consumers and businesses who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter more than 80% plan to purchase iPads.Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new fourth quarter record with revenue of $6.5 billion, up 54% year-over-year with growth accelerating from the third quarter across all five geographic segments.
And as Tim mentioned, we set Q4 records for our Wearables category in every single market we track around the world.Our retail and online stores produced fantastic results, generating record September quarter revenue in all five geographic segments, and strong double-digit growth across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and accessories.
This iconic store is opened seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and provides an even better environment for customers to experience our latest products, meet with our geniuses, creative pros and specialists, and attend our free daily Today at Apple sessions.We also opened our newest and largest store in Japan, and fifth store in Tokyo, in the Marunouchi business district across from the historic Tokyo Station, and we opened a beautiful new store in the heart of Mexico City's vibrant Polanco district to welcome visitors to experience the best of Apple in Mexico.We are seeing strong demand for our products in the enterprise market, with growth significantly ahead of our business overall, and we have great momentum transforming major industries.
Hundreds of thousands of Apple devices will be deployed this fiscal year to support an innovative new model for the collection and management of Census data and we are proud that our products will play an important role in driving quality to this critical initiative while safeguarding the privacy and security of this data.CDW Apple's partner in this initiative will also utilize Apple Financial Services, our enterprise financing platform to help minimize the cost to the public by taking advantage of the uniquely strong residual value of Apple devices.Let me now turn to our cash position.
So can you just talk about the gives and takes that land you at the December quarter gross margin guidance?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYes. On the other side, foreign exchange for us continues to be probably the biggest headwind that we've got right now is going to be negative 70 basis points on a sequential basis.
And for our pro customers who push the limits of what Mac can do, we're very excited about the upcoming launch of our newly redesigned Mac Pro this fall, which we are proud to be manufacturing in Austin, Texas.Pulling back the lens from a single quarter, we are incredibly proud of our accomplishments over the course of a remarkable fiscal 2019, a year where we crossed $100 billion in revenue in the United States for the first time.
We continue to put user privacy at the center of everything that we do and we know that Apple is strongest when our commitment to diversity and inclusion brings all voices to the table.I'd like to thank our customers, our developers, our business partners and our employees for making fiscal 2019 such a success, and I look forward to another great year in 2020.Now for more details on our September quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone.Revenue for the quarter was $64 billion, up 2% from a year ago to a new September quarter record as we had predicted foreign exchange negatively impacted our revenue by close to $1 billion, and in constant currency, our growth was 3%.
More than half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all-time high.We had great results for iPad with revenue of $4.7 billion, up 17% from a year ago.
In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the September quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high.
And if you think that's something that's realistic to expect in fiscal '20?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerKaty, it's Tim. We are very thrilled with what we're seeing in early going on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. We've put our current thinking in the guidance and you can tell from the guidance we are bullish.Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGreat.
I'm sure, I agree with Luca, you've been very instrumental over the years.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director, Investor RelationsThank you.Shannon Cross -- Cross Research -- AnalystMy questions though with regard to China, and I don't know, Tim, if you can talk more about what you're seeing in China, the trends during the quarter, the reception specifically there to the iPhone, any thoughts on -- you know, Hong Kong used to be a big market, there is obviously some turmoil there.
Thank you.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, we had a very good September, Shannon, and the lead of that is sort of the reception of iPhone 11 and 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, and so we feel really good about how we've gotten started there.
And when we do that we need to make the adequate investments in marketing and advertising to raise the awareness of the new products and new services and that is what you're seeing for example in the guidance that we provided for the first quarter as we're launching new services right now, and so we're making investments both in engineering and in advertising to support the new launches.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director, Investor RelationsThank you, Shannon.
So we'll see how it goes, but we take into account all these different factors.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerOn the bundle question, Toni, we look at each service, and decide what's best to do for it and with TV+, we concluded that a great way to get more people to see the content would be to do this, and it would be a good gift for our users.
That's a part of what we announced with the Apple Card earlier in the call and so we are cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of standard kind of basis and we are committed to make that easier to do than perhaps it is today.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director, Investor RelationsThank you, Toni.
I do think the upgrade market will get larger over time, but just don't have a current view as to how often and so forth.On the AirPods, we're anxious to see the customers for the new AirPods Pro, but I would guess that one particularly in the early going will be people that have AirPods today and want to have -- also have a pair for the times that they need noise-cancellation.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director, Investor RelationsThank you, Samik.

8,apple,q1,2020,"After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook.
Our record performance was fueled by iPhone where December quarter revenue was up 8% year-over-year and by our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth outside of iPhone, including a new all-time record for Services and another blowout quarter for Wearables.Our active installed base of devices has now surpassed 1.5 billion, up over 100 million in the last 12 months alone reaching a new all-time high for each of our main product categories and geographic segments.
We continue to focus on telling stories that matter like Little America, which recently premiered to widespread critical acclaim with much more great content still to come.Apple News now draws over 100 million monthly active users in the US, UK, Australia and Canada and provides a curated and personalized experience using on-device intelligence to recommend stories.
And the high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty for both products drove the active installed base of both Mac and iPad to new records in all geographic segments.
With our current lineup of iPad Pro, iPad Air iPad mini and iPad, along with the new iPad OS, we give our customers an unparalleled tablet experience integrated -- integrating hardware, software and services in a way that only Apple can.This was also a very exciting quarter for the Mac as we launched our most powerful notebook ever.
Thanks in part to a doubling in iPhone trade-ins versus last year, our retail and online stores set an all-time record and delivered strong double-digit growth in iPhone.
Today, millions of students in more than 5,000 schools worldwide use Everyone Can Code curriculum to bring their ideas to life and develop important skills, including creativity, collaboration and problem solving.November also saw the launch of our new Research app, the latest in our ongoing effort to put the future of health in the hands of every user.
Services revenue grew 17% to a new all-time record $12.7 billion, with double-digit growth in every geographic segment, a new all-time record across our portfolio.Company gross margin was 38.4%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue in spite of a negative 60 basis point impact from foreign exchange.
We've actually already reached that goal on a run rate basis with the results of the December quarter.Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double-digits in all of our geographic segments.
Given the tremendous momentum we are experiencing across our services offerings, we are increasing our target for paid subscriptions and aim to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020.App Store revenue grew strong double-digits.
Apple Music set an all-time revenue record offering a catalog of over 60 million songs to our customers.
iCloud also generated an all-time revenue record growing very strong double-digits, while offering our customers a safe, secure and seamless experience across all their devices.
And among both consumers and businesses were planning to purchase tablets in the March quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPads.Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new all-time record with revenue of $10 billion, up 37% year-over-year with very strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments and growth across wearables, accessories and home.
How much of the growth you think is coming from first-time buyers of AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have because it looks to us adoption rates are fairly low in your installed base, so that there should be a long runway, but love to just understand how you see the growth divide up between those two buckets?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah.
We're seeing that with Little America and others.Tom Forte -- D.A. And then my second question is, I think you indicated that last month, you started offering consumers the ability to use a Apple Card to buy an iPhone on an installment basis.
Can you talk about how that's had an impact on your unit sales for iPhones?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerSo retail stores did fantastic on iPhone, very strong double-digit growth in iPhone from a year-over-year point of view.
Once again, we saw double-digit growth in all five of our geographic segments and established new all-time records for multiple categories, including cloud services, music, payment services and our App Store search ad business, as well as setting a December quarter record for the App Store and Apple Care.
Apple Watch had a great start to fiscal 2020, setting an all-time revenue record during the quarter.
We are working closely with our Apple team members and partners in the affected areas, and our thoughts are with all of those affected across the region.As we close the books on a record-breaking December quarter, we are already well under way on some new and exciting developments for the future.
Apple strength will always be its boundless creativity and innovation, and this year will be no different.But for now for more details on the results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tim. Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional as we set new all-time records for revenue, net income and earnings per share.
Products revenue was $79.1 billion, up 8% as iPhone return to growth, and we have incredibly strong results in Wearables where we set all-time records for both Apple Watch and AirPods.
As Tim mentioned, we established new all-time records for Apple Music, cloud services, payment services and our App Store search ad business and December quarter records for the App Store and Apple Care.
But we expect that, that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and cost savings.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Amit.
And so, it was an important part of it.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Tom. Tim, can you talk about what you're seeing in the region -- what you were seeing in the region prior to the health crisis.
Thank you.Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYes, as I said earlier to the question around the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, we are seeing a benign commodity environment.
And so, we will continue that practice as we go through the year.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Shannon.
And so while these services did not have a material impact in our December quarter results, we expect that over time these are contributing to the growth of the Services business, but we feel very happy with the 17%.Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystThank you for that.
The amount of revenue that we recognized during the quarter was immaterial to our results.With regard to the cost of the service, of developing the content, we -- essentially, as we incur this cost, we put them on the balance sheet and then we amortize them over a certain period of time depending on the type of content that we produce.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThanks, Wamsi.
Kind of curious how much of that is part of it is driven by some of your Intel modem asset purchases or TV+ in the opex or how do we think about it on a go-forward basis?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I think we felt good about our opex results because they were at the low end of our guidance range, but clearly, we want to make all the necessary investments in the business and from -- in terms of the new services, not only for TV+, but all the new services that we launched during 2019, this is a period where we're making the necessary investments in advertising and marketing and that level of investment is reflected in our opex results.
There are already companies that are deep into the enterprise business that are working on applications for the enterprise and of course, you can see -- you can go on the store and see thousands of apps that are AR Kit-enabled at this time and with even more coming.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Mike.
Our net income, for example, was up 11% during the December quarter.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you.
And we feel we have a very good momentum.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Samik.

9,apple,q2,2020,"While our product teams were preparing to launch a new iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, MacBook Air and the new iPhone SE, all of which have been very well received by reviewers and consumers alike, they were also working with our suppliers to design, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5 million face shields, and we continue to ship more than 1 million of these every week to the doctors, nurses and medical personnel on the frontlines.In a quarter, where our Services teams achieved strong growth, which Luca will dig into in a minute and which speaks to the real durability of our services strategy, these teams were also putting COVID-19 front and center.
Based on Apple's performance during the first five weeks of the quarter, we were confident we were headed toward a record second quarter at the very high end of our expectations.In the next five weeks of the quarter, as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, as well as demand for our products within China.
During the last three weeks of the quarter, as the virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including the closure of all our retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13 and many channel partner points of sales around the world, we saw a downward pressure on demand particularly for iPhone and Wearables.
Apple will continue to do everything we can do to help the global response and to keep our customers learning, creating, sharing and connecting so that live can remain as normal as it can during this challenging time.With that, I'll hand things off to Luca.Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone.It has been a very different quarter than we were expecting when we last talked to you at the end of January, but we could not be more proud of our Apple teams around the world, our role in supporting local communities and our partners throughout the value chain, and how resilient our business and financial performance has been during these challenging times.So the revenue for the quarter was $58.3 billion, up 1% from a year ago, despite the extreme circumstances from the impact of COVID-19 and a headwind of 100 basis points from foreign exchange.
After a very strong January, our performance was impacted, particularly during the last three weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures increased due to COVID-19 spreading around the world and affected our product sales.
Our operations team and manufacturing partners put forth an extraordinary effort to restore production quickly, and we exited the quarter in a good supply position for most of our product lines.On the demand side, after a very strong first five weeks, we saw the impact of COVID-19 affect demand in China for the next five weeks and then more broadly around the world for the last three weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures became more widespread in many countries.
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow strongly, and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter.
For example, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach as over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch around the world during the quarter, were new to the product.Next, I'd like to talk about Mac and iPad. Towards the end of the quarter, we launched a brand-new iPad Pro that includes a first-in-class LiDAR scanner with some really exciting augmented reality applications, and MacBook Air, with significantly improved performance at a lower price.
We returned $22 billion to shareholders during the March quarter, including $18.5 billion through open market repurchases of 64.7 million Apple shares and $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents.Finally, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call.
However, based on what we have seen in April and how we think things might play out, I would like to provide some additional insight on headwinds and tailwinds we're facing.From a foreign exchange standpoint, the US dollar has appreciated recently against most currencies around the world, and as a result, we expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by more than $1.5 billion on a year-over-year basis.
First, customers are actively engaging with our ecosystem and digital services, and we believe the very strong recent performance in the App Store, video, Music and cloud services will continue throughout the June quarter.
We will continue to stay focused on what we do best, investing in our product and service pipeline, managing the business wisely and taking care of our teams, and believe we will come out from this stronger.With that, let's open the call to questions.Tejas Gala -- Senior Manager, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Luca.
We think by looking at it, a part of it is due to just our new products, a part of it is due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April, and then a part of it is probably the consumer behavior of knowing this is going to go on for a little while longer and getting some devices and so forth lined up to work at home more.In particular for, as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year-over-year basis during this quarter.
And obviously, we want to develop that technology because we consider it's a core technology for us.And so we will try to balance the need to continue to invest during difficult circumstances and the fact that we like to manage the business wisely.Tejas Gala -- Senior Manager, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Shannon.
They are even more important in these times.Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America -- AnalystThank you, Tim. As a follow-up, I know you're doing a lot with both the Apple Card and financing plan for iPhones to get your products in the hands of customers.
And then I have a follow-up.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerI think there are things from just a great reminder of how important our products are and -- for remote work.
And so we expect our digital services to continue at the same level of performance that we have seen during the March quarter.
And that includes the App Store, of course, our video business, our Music business, cloud services, so we expect all these businesses to continue to grow very strongly.Given the overall economic environment, the level of demand right now, there are two businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during the June quarter.
Let's look quickly across the business.At the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get our latest generation of devices manufactured and into our customers' hands, our worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of the company were also sourcing more than 30 million masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring they're donated to places of greatest need in every region around the world.
And services like FaceTime and Messages set new all-time records for daily volume during this quarter as users relied on their devices to stay connected in a new reality.In software, at the same time that our teams work with great creativity and excitement as we prepare to deliver our first-ever all-online Worldwide Developers Conference later this quarter, they also worked with the same creativity and speed to put together our COVID-19 symptom checking website and app, in partnership with the CDC.
While we felt some temporary supply constraints in February, our operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work and production was back at typical levels toward the end of March.
However, on a demand basis, our performance was stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory more than we did a year ago.Importantly, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories.Services revenue followed a different trend with very strong year-over-year growth of 17%.
As Tim mentioned, we are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal '16 Services revenue during 2020.App Store revenue grew by strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions.
Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased over 30% year-over-year, reaching a new all-time high.
With this momentum, we are confident we will reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new March quarter record, with revenue of $6.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year, with strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments.
And the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 95% for iPad and 96% for Mac.In the enterprise market, businesses everywhere have been making the transition to working remotely.
We have also realigned our own retail business and enterprise teams to provide timely and relevant support to customers as they navigate new work environments.
Advertising, which is comprised of third-party agreements, our App Store search ads and Apple News ads, has been impacted by overall economic weakness and uncertainty on when businesses will reopen.For gross margin, sequential headwinds include foreign exchange, the mix within products and the seasonal loss of leverage on our product business.
And do you feel comfortable that the supply chain and the manufacturing base is well situated today to launch the traditional fall products that they used to get from Apple?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah.
Apple Care is essentially comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements that we signed with our customers when they purchased our devices.

10,bankofamerica,q1,2018,"Loans on a period-end basis declined $2.7 billion as consumers began paying down credit card balances following a period of strong holiday spend in Q4.
Liquidity remained strong, with average global liquidity sources of $522 billion and a liquidity coverage ratio of 124%.Equity decreased a little more than $900 million from Q4.
Global Market activity drove the increase under both approaches, but the increase was offset under Advanced by declines in consumer credit and continued roll-off of legacy mortgages.
The supplemental leverage ratio declined modestly from balance sheet growth but continued to well exceed regulatory minimums.Turning to Slide 6, on an average basis, total loans increased to $932 billion.
Global banking deposits increased $19 billion or 6% as we grew client balances domestically across all sectors of commercial clients and internationally with corporate clients.Turning to asset quality on Slide 7, total net charge-offs were $911 million or 40 basis points of average loans.
Partially offsetting this growth was the absence of NII resulting from 2Q 2017's sale of the U.K. consumer credit card business and higher funding costs for Global Markets.Focusing on net interest yield, it is flat year over year as the benefits of broad improvement in asset yield versus funding cost was offset by two notable factors: First, the Q2 '17 of higher-yielding U.K. card portfolio, and second, the impact from the lower-yielding Global Markets assets.
NII on an FTE basis and a comparison to prior periods was further impacted by tax reform, which lowered NII on an FTE basis by roughly $100 million.With respect to deposit pricing, overall interest-bearing deposit rate paid in Q1 rose 4 basis points from Q4 '17 and 21 basis points year over year.
We continue to reduce non-client-facing roles while increasing client-facing roles, such as relationship bankers and consumer business banking and commercial, as well as financial advisors and wealth management.As we signaled on our 4Q call, expenses increased compared to Q4 '17.
Consumer Banking's earnings increased to $2.7 billion in Q1, returning 30% unallocated capital.
Rates paid remained very low at just less than 5 basis points.Year-over-year net charge-offs increased $105 million as we continue to experience modest and expected phasing of our credit card portfolio along with loan growth.
Provision expense increased $97 million year over year.Okay, turning to Slide 12 and key trends, looking first at revenue.
Strong AUM flows over the past 12 months and a tailwind with respect to market appreciation once again drove strong asset management fees, offsetting modest pricing pressure.At the same time, brokerage revenue continued to face headwinds as volume declined and mix shifted.
While we were pleased with revenue this quarter, I would note that the market levels at fee pricing points were quite healthy this quarter and have since retreated.Moving to Slide 15, we continued to see strong overall client engagement in Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust.
Year-over-year client balances rose $140 billion or 5% to $2.7 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows, and continued loan growths.
Average loans of $159 billion grew 7% year over year and the growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate as well as structured lending.Turning to Slide 16, Global Banking earned just over $2 billion, generating a 20% return on allocated capital.
On a pre-tax basis, earnings declined 2% year over year, driven by lower investment banking fees and revenue impacts on an FTE basis of tax reform with respect to tax-advantaged assets.
As I said last quarter, optimism among clients remains high, so we continue to expect loan demand to pick up.Looking at trends on Slide 17, in comparison to Q1 last year with respect to average loans, the 3% growth was led by international regions and domestic middle-market C&I.
Global Markets revenue was $4.7 billion and earnings increased to $1.4 billion, returning 16% unallocated capital.
Equity sales and trading revenue at $1.5 billion reached a record of 38% year over year.Results were driven by increased client activity and a strong trading performance in derivatives.
Revenue and FICC sales and trading at $2.5 billion increased 13%, driven by lower client activity and less favorable credit markets compared to a very robust prior-year quarter.
Revenue declined $240 million year over year, primarily due to the absence of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business sold in 2Q '17.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerLook, Bank of America and the industry have not increased deposit pricing appreciably on traditional accounts.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerThat's right.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat's generally right.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystGreat, thanks a lot.OperatorWe'll move next to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
That comes down to practical questions of getting leases and things up and running, but if it provided a lot more pop, we might move it up, and that might cost a little bit more, but it'd be modest.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorI know a while ago you mentioned processing costs associated with cash and checks were pretty high -- if I recall correctly, somewhere around $5 billion.
Bove -- Hilton Capital -- Chief StrategistI think you've done an unbelievably good job -- a phenomenal job, I would argue -- in terms of turning this company around, but I'm just wondering because I'm going back two years, not just looking at one quarter, and I'm seeing that common equity just doesn't grow.
During the first quarter, we continued to play the role that our company plays and helped economies grow around the world, by supplying capital and through debt and equity underwriting for growth for those companies.In our company, we grew loans by more than 5% year over year in aggregate across the businesses.
While our market balance sheet grew to support our clients, our bar of value at risk remained stable year over year.The fourth tenet of responsible growth is to grow on a sustainable basis, and we did that by investing in our people and our communities and by driving operational excellence.
We're expanding those in markets where we traditionally have had commercial and wealth management businesses, and now we'll have a full franchise.As you think about people, our investments, and our teammates, year over year, we've added 1,500 primary relationship teammates.
None of these were material, and they are described more fully in our appendix of our press release and earnings deck.Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 5, overall, compared to the end of Q4, end-of-period assets of $2.3 trillion increased $47 billion, driven by growth to support Global Markets clients as well as higher cash balances from strong deposit growth.
On the other hand, loans in our business segments were up $45 billion or 5.5% year over year.Consumer Banking grew 8%, led by mortgages and credit cards.
Our reserve coverage remained strong, with an allowance-to-loan ratio of 1.1% and a coverage level 2.8 times our annual net charge-offs for the quarter.On Slide 8, we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios with respect to consumer net charge-offs of $830 million, or up $61 million from Q4.
This quarter marks the first quarter we have reported an efficiency ratio below 60% on an FTE basis.Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer on Slide 11, another very strong quarter for this business as the value of deposits, growth of both loans and deposits, as well as the investments we have made in people and our ability to better connect with customers continued to improve financial results.
Value of our deposits as rates rose, along with growth and client balances, drove the 9% year-over-year improvement in revenue.
Driven by NII growth, revenue grew 9% year over year, reflecting the value of our deposits and our relationships with customers, which continue to deepen as we expand capabilities.
Service charges were down modestly as a result of the full-quarter impact of the elimination of certain overdraft fees late in Q4.Focusing on client balances, on the bottom of the page, you can see the success -- we continue to have growing deposits, loans, and brokerage assets.
Sales on digital devices now account for 26% of all sales.Turning to record results in our Global Wealth and Investment Management business on Slide 14, strong client activity, a market which was up year over year, higher rates, and solid expense management pushed GWIM's earnings this quarter to over $1 billion for the first time ever.
On a pre-tax basis, earnings were down modestly year over year, driven by lower revenue and increased expenses from continued technology investments.
That's over now, by and large, so the growth that we're seeing in the underlying million-plus new cards we do every quarter and the usage by the customers and primary usage has been pretty consistent, and ought to bode well for continued growth, but it's really getting rid of the drag of -- getting rid of portfolios of the last couple years.John McDonald -- Sanford C.
We're just going to have to balance -- we're going to continue to balance the needs of our customers in the competitive market environment with that of our shareholders' interest, and we'll do the right thing at the right moment.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJust to add to that, people get focused on the rates, so as a clear statement for all in rate pay, for all our deposits, about 24 basis points -- obviously, extremely beneficial versus any other way to raise money in the markets, which are multiples of that.
But, people forget that comes from the value of the customer franchise, and so, if you think about the consumer business, half their deposits are checking.The CDs have been running off and are sort of bouncing around with $2 billion to $3 billion of runoff on a year-over-year basis, so it is driven by the fact that the core transaction accounts, the balances have grown over $7,000.00 per balance of checking account in the consumer franchise, and as we add more accounts and grow in these new markets, we're getting the primary relationship in the household, which means you're getting the transaction money, which is moving at all times.
On the specifics for us, if you use the last three years of scenarios, our stress capital buffer would be 2.5% because we'd be below the floor, and on our ongoing, forward-looking basis, we feel good about the stress depletion and the stress capital buffer because of the way we run the company.We're focused on responsible growth, loan to consumer, prime, and super-prime.
Does the branch buildout -- is that a net neutral to these numbers of $53 billion or have you factored that into that expense expectation?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThose investments are all factored in.
The bad news for you, Brian -- the tax cut was supposed to lead to a lot of loan growth, the higher rates were supposed to lead to much higher margins, volatility was expected to lead to much higher trading -- not from your guidance, but just generally in the market.
The good news is even with the dessert, so to speak, you guys still had some very nice efficiency, so if you could elaborate more on the record Consumer efficiency and tie that more to the 1.4 billion quarterly hits you had in digital banking and how much of the Consumer efficiency is due to digital versus branch closures or other actions, and where do you think that could go?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMike, you're sort of stating the debate that's gone on.
-- AnalystSo, do you still expect branches to decline even with all those branch additions?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt's always going to be a question of modest changes, because remember, we're adding the branches, taking them out, redoing branches, and making them bigger.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerOn a year-over-year basis, a lot of the increase in Global Markets was the result of client activity in equities.
In terms of the cash you're seeing on the balance sheet, yes, we had the positive growth, we saw some cash buildup -- with that cash buildup, a lot of it is for people who want to pay their taxes, so a portion of that cash buildup is going to run out in the second quarter.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerYou mean the quarter-over-quarter 4Q to Q1?Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Managing DirectorExactly.Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerIt's impacted by the growth in global markets, but it's also impacted quarter over quarter by the change in corporate tax rate on an FTE basis.
We're buying securities that we think make sense to balance liquidity, earnings, and capital of the company in all sorts of market environments.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMarty, just to be simple, we're not going to take losses in the current period to hit equity and reposition the portfolio.
So, strategically, think about that shift and what that means going forward.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell, what it doesn't mean is that we're not delivering mortgage loans for our customers and home equity loans.
But, it's immaterial for financial reporting and the context of $23 billion in revenue a quarter, but it's not immaterial in the minds of our Consumer customers and our Wealth Management customers, and there, you can see that we continue to drive our mortgage capabilities through it, including introducing a digital mortgage product this quarter that I think is going to be the best in the industry.Paul M.
I think you're seeing the benefit of that in loan growth generally, but certainly in C&I.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBrian, one thing I'd say is we have done a good job in the small business segment and the business banking, which is $50-million-and-under-revenue companies for business banking and $5-million-and-under for small business.
I think in small business this quarter, year over year, we had a 9% growth in loan balances, and in business banking, we probably had mid-single digits.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerThe balances have been declining for many quarters as people shifted to AUM, and this was the first time in two years that balances were actually up.
Remember, balances go up because the market goes up, balances go up because of flows, and the combination of those two things -- for the first time in many quarters -- saw an increase.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAgain, similar to the small-business/business banking relative to the commercial, underneath, the Merrill Edge piece -- which is geared at the mass-affluent market segment -- had record flows and is growing 18% or 20% year over year.
At some point, given the fact that assets do grow, that market capitalization does grow, common equity is going to have to grow, and I don't know when that is.But, the second question is we've seen -- again, looking longer-term, going back to the fourth quarter of 2015 -- something like a 165-basis-point increase in the overnight rate, and the net interest margin of the bank is up 25 basis points.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, we told you that versus last year first quarter, it had been up 12 basis points, but we sold a portfolio of higher-yielding cards.
Would it take a capital hit at this point, or are there not buyers, or do you just think it's better to work these things out over time?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell, we've taken all approaches.

11,bankofamerica,q2,2018,"This quarter marks the 11th straight quarter where Bank of America has grown its average deposits more than $40 billion on a year-over-year quarter comparison basis.We added more credit cards, we added more checking accounts on the consumer side, and we added more accounts and households in our Merrill Edge online brokerage.
In fact, the charge-off ratio has been below 50 basis points for 14 of the last 17 quarters.In Global Markets, we continue to see a strong return on our lower-value risk metric than many of our peers, all while continuing to generate growth and improve profitability.
Here, we display the results, and typically, Paul will cover these as part of the Consumer Banking dialogue, but I think it's important to understand how responsible growth and driving sustainable operating leverage works.
Provision expense was $827 million, $101 million higher than Q2 '17, driven primarily by the seasoning of our credit card portfolio, loan growth, and a modestly lower reserve release.Brian already covered the significant improvement in returns seen on this slide.
If you look at the first half of the year, we issued $3.7 billion of lower-yielding preferred stock ahead of redemptions of $2.8 billion of higher-yielding preferred stock, and note we have called another $900 million that we'll settle in the third quarter.Given a $1 billion decline in the value of AFS securities, which impacts OCI, common equity decreased by $0.5 billion as we returned 90% of net income earned in the quarter to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases.
Total loan growth continued to be impacted by the runoff of non-core consumer real estate loans.On the other hand, loans in our business segments were up $45 billion or 5% year over year.
Compared to Q1 '18, the increase was driven by commercial bouncing around the bottom.Our reserve coverage remained strong, with an allowance-to-loan ratio of 1.08% and a coverage level 2.6 times our annual net charge-offs for the quarter.On Slide 10, we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios.
This growth is even more impressive given Q2 '17 included $140 million of NII from the U.K. card business, which we sold in June of last year.Note we have presented the net interest yield excluding the impact of net interest income and related assets associated with our Global Markets segment.
For example, women make up 45% of these interns, and 55% are ethnically or racially diverse.Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 13, another great quarter for this business as client balances grew, revenues increased, and expenses were down.
Provision expense increased $110 million from Q2 '17, in line with the increase in net charge-offs.Turning to Slide 14 and key trends, looking first at revenue, we believe relationship deepening is driving improvement in revenue, predominantly NII.
Customer satisfaction in Consumer Banking reached a new high, with roughly 81% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale.Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, we continued to grow deposits, loans, and brokerage assets.
Absent the impact of tax reform, the business would have created modest revenue growth and operating leverage.IBCs of $1.4 billion for the overall firm declined 7% year over year, driven by lower advisory fees from a record quarter a year ago.
So, I would expect that kind of a range as you look out the next couple of quarters, and that would reflect seasoning and loan growth in the card portfolio in that number.John McDonald -- Sanford C.
So, I want to ask an NII question, and I saw the comments on ex Global Markets, the net interest yield being up 12 basis points, deposit betas are good, so the core business that we all focus on is good.
Page 9 of the supplement has the average balances.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJust think of it -- it's a matched book, so it moves together pretty quickly due to the fact it's all short term, both on the liability side, and then, they're long assets, but they price up as the curve moves.
Next quarter, you might see it settle in a little bit more like it traditionally does.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorOkay, that's good, because the flattening out on total net interest income is really that as opposed to the core business.
And so, we had a record quarter in the second quarter last year, and so, the $1.4 billion-ish level is more in line with second quarters across time, but the team knows they can do a better job, and they're after it.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorAll right, thank you.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
On card, we've seen mid-single-digit year-over-year growth, which has modestly increased over the past couple of quarters.With respect to consumer real estate, originations are solid and balances are growing well, but there are headwinds continuing from the runoff of the non-core portfolio, and remember, we're booking 90% of our mortgages now on the balance sheet.
If you look at this quarter, we saw really good growth in small business, we saw good growth in structured lending and GWIM, so in any quarter, we might see growth, but it's always seemed to average out at that mid-single-digit level.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystOkay, and in that context, as we think about deposit growth slowing -- I don't know if it's a large impact from the TruPS and your rate sensitivity -- how do we think about NII growth going forward given the implied curve today?Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, most of the deposit growth in Global Banking has been in interest-bearing deposits, so we are definitely seeing a shift there from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBut, it's very different by business.
So, in the business banking segment, it's 5 to 1 non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing, and when you get to corporate, it's more interest-bearing than non-interest-bearing, so again, it differs by the type of customer it is, too.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorOkay, but I guess part of the point you're making is that that's in the run rate already.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, and the point is that you'll see -- to go back since the tightening started in '15 and think about the global scheme of things, you can see that tightening moves across that, you've seen what's happened with the deposit rates.
They'll continue to move, but you've backed out and played through it all, you still see the asset sensitivity at just under $3 billion for a 100-basis-point rise, 70% is in the short term, and that takes all the stuff we're talking about and puts it into the forward curve assumption.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorAnd, the checking accounts that you're growing on the consumer side -- do you see that more in your branch expansion areas, or is that more in your legacy -- for lack of a better word -- legacy footprint?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt has to be in the legacy because the expansion footprint is so small.
If I could follow up a little bit more on that lower right part of the funding side -- Paul, can you walk us through the benefits you expect from trust-preferred redemption, and if you are going to refinance that, and what would be the net benefit as you think about that and forward NII?Paul M.
Is that how we should think about it?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think there's lots of trade-offs consumers make, but this is the money going in and out of their checking account on a given day, so if you're growing it, the average balance of $7,500.00 -- between our preferred and our retail segment, they'd be different each segment, but this is money in motion, for lack of a better term, Mike, as you're thinking about it.
Should we expect that to stay at 48%, or can you improve a lot more, and if so, where?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerLook, we never -- Mike, as you know, we don't sit there and say, ""48% is great and let's stop."" And so, I think if you look at that, they'll continue to work to improve it.
A little bit of that on the same expense base makes a heck of a turn, and if you think about it, 850 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year matched quarter is pretty effective.So, it's a combination of all those investments I talked about earlier coming true and the efficiency embedded in that, a combination of more sales digital and efficiency embedded in the sales process because this 48% counts everything, and a combination of continuing to grow checking accounts and the deposit balances, which are the highest potential revenue growth product for them in the short term with a big business like that.
Your marketing spend did not increase, at least in contrast to some of your peers, and the thought there is as you relate to customers less with branches, more digital, maybe you want more support from a marketing standpoint, but that, at least, is not showing through in your expense numbers.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah.
But, all told, I think it's about 35-40% of the sales transaction initiated by a marketing lead, for lack of a better term, driven by analytics into the branch system or into the digital experience.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystAll right, thank you.OperatorAnd, we'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerLook, in Q2 '17, we did have a small non-operating charge, so I wouldn't use this quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year growth rate as the growth rate going forward.
If you look more generally, we're seeing growth in our card balances, and we think that's going to continue in 2018.
So, all that together is a more complex thing, but at the end of the day, you put it all together, we made $2.8 billion after tax, 48% efficiency ratio, deposits grew by $35 billion year over year, $26 billion of which was checking, to give you a sense, which relies on all those great capabilities to fuel it and why we think we're taking share.Nancy Bush -- NAB Research -- OwnerSo, I guess what you're saying -- there has been a tendency in the industry to look at digital versus branch as sort of an either/or proposition, and you're saying that that's not necessarily correct at this point.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, because a half million people went to their mobile device, set up an appointment, came in the branch, another million responded to calls, and 50 million people walked in, and yet, we had 1.4 billion logins.
Are we in a new environment that's something we haven't seen before, where it's just consistent?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell, we could never -- we are a bank, Nancy, as you well know, and therefore, the general economy is always going to have an impact.
Good morning, Paul.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe missed you the first time, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystI know.
And, of course, while it's true that tax reform is benefiting our bottom line as well as corporations around America, income before taxes also grew and second-quarter reported pre-tax income improved 5% year over year, but after adjusting for some select items, which Paul is going to cover later, a better way to look at it is pre-tax income is up 11%.Our balance sheet from both a capital and liquidity standpoint remains extremely strong.
Our immediate priority remains to use capital to buy back shares that we don't need for business growth, but importantly, we increased our dividend by 25%.Our responsible growth strategy continues to work, growing earnings returns and capital returns, and doing so the right way.
Before I review comparative period performance, let me remind you of a few select items which I think are helpful in understanding our operating performance.In Q2 '17, we had a net after-tax gain from the sale of our U.K. card consumer business of roughly $100 million, which included a revenue benefit of nearly $800 million in other income, mostly offset by a tax cost of nearly $700 million.
We would expect the tax rate to be roughly 21% in the second half of 2018 absent unusual items.Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 7, overall, compared with the end of Q1, end-of-period assets of $2.3 trillion decreased $37 billion, driven by lower Global Markets assets as well as lower deposit levels, primarily due to seasonal customer tax payments.
We're seeing aggressive terms in structure; however, we remained disciplined, and from a consistency standpoint, as you can see in the bottom right chart, loan growth in our business segment has been mid-single-digit consistently for several years now.This chart compares year-over-year growth over the past five quarters.
Global banking deposits were strong, growing 8%, and included movement from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing.Turning to asset quality on Slide 9, total net charge-offs were $996 million or 43 basis points of average loans and increased as expected.
Excluding the storm-related losses, the credit card loss rate increased 22 basis points from Q2 '17.Consumer NPLs of $4.6 billion declined 5% from Q1 and 47% of our consumer NPLs remain current on their payments.
The net interest yield excluding Global Markets increased 12 basis points year over year to 2.95%, driven by broad improvement in asset yields relative to funding costs.Moving back to total NII, Q2 GAAP NII increased modestly versus Q1, as the benefits of higher interest rates and one extra day was offset by seasonal client activity in Global Markets and seasonal paydowns of credit card loans.
As I mentioned earlier, Q2 '17 included roughly $300 million in impairment associated with data centers that we sold, so, excluding that charge, expense still declined nearly $400 million or 3% with broad improvements across most categories, and I would emphasize that we achieved this reduction while continuing to invest in new technology, new financial centers, and sales staff.With respect to sales professionals, we continue to add relationship bankers in consumer, business banking, and commercial, as well as financial advisors in wealth management, and notably, despite adding sales professionals, our headcount is down roughly 3,000 from last year as we reduce non-client-facing roles by streamlining how we work and deliver for customers.
These types of improvements are fueling higher spending and more borrowing, and we believe we are gaining share and deepening relationships in this growing economy.Earnings in Consumer Banking increased to $2.9 billion, returning 31% on allocated capital.
Consumer Banking created over 850 basis points of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 8% while expenses were down.
Whether it is access to one of our 4,000 licensed advisors and a world-leading research platform or how integrated Edge is with other banking needs, we think customers are noticing and giving us more of their investment dollars.Expenses were down slightly compared to Q2 '17 as productivity improvements more than offset the continued investment in financial center renovations and technology initiatives.
This quarter, we opened 13 new financial centers and renovated another 65.Okay, turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 15, GWIM produced another quarter of solid results, nearing the record $1 billion of net income earned in Q1 and producing the second-highest pre-tax margin ever at 28%.
Strong client activity and a healthy equity market coupled with solid expense management all benefited the results.
Growth in households and deepening of relationships is helping offset industry dynamics driven by consumer behaviors.Strong AUM flows and market appreciation increased AUM balances, driving a 10% increase in asset management fees.
The business managed costs well, creating operating leverage.Moving to Slide 16, we continue to see strong overall client engagement in Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust.
Year-over-year client balances rose to record levels of nearly $2.8 trillion driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows, and continued loan growth.
Average loans of $161 billion grew 7% year over year with continued strength in consumer real estate and structured lending.Turning to Slide 17, Global Banking earned just over $2 billion, growing 16% from Q2 '17 and generating a 20% on allocated capital.
Earnings were up 35% as revenue growth outpaced expense increases from higher revenue-led costs and continued technology investments.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerAre you talking about the increase in the cost of our long-term debt quarter over quarter?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo, Fed funds.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorFed funds on the wholesale funding side.
It's not coming from CDs or other types of high-cost deposits -- driving the total deposit growth.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystAnd then, Consumer Banking efficiency ratio of 48% -- I'm not sure if that's the lowest in history, but maybe that's good news/bad news.
We're focused on attracting relatively high-quality card customers and rewarding them for deepening their overall relationship with us, and we think that strategy is driving incremental deposit growth, making our deposits more sticky, and it also lowers our cost because those people tend to interact less with the bank.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Managing DirectorOkay, thank you.OperatorWe'll go next to Saul Martinez with UBS.
Please go ahead.Saul Martinez -- UBS Group -- Managing DirectorHey, good morning.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Saul Martinez -- UBS Group -- Managing DirectorOn NII, Paul, obviously, part of the lack of clarity around the NII guide is in part due to the uncertainty around retail deposit beta and on the consumer side, where you haven't seen much of anything in terms of deposit rates moving up, but is there anything that gives you pause, that we are nearing a tipping point?
",19.1,0.7865959
12,bankofamerica,q3,2018,"This capital return allowed us to reduce our share count by over 5% year over year and grow EPS faster than earnings.So, beginning on Slide 2, during the third quarter, our 200,000-plus teammates did a great job for you, our shareholders.
The value of our deposit franchise is showing both in our NII and our net interest yield improvement, and Paul is gonna take you through the details on that later.Our balance sheet from both a capital and liquidity standpoint remains very strong, allowing us to pay $4 billion in common dividends year to date and spend $15 billion to reduce our share count in the same period.
We have now doubled those assets twice in the past eight years, with plenty of room ahead for future growth.Overall, our client balances within our Wealth Management business -- the best business there is in the world -- exceeded $2.8 trillion.
This discipline, combined with great customer work, produces operating leverage.As we go to Slide 3, in 2015 and 2016, some of you also questioned whether we could drive operating leverage, were expenses attributable to run-off activities, or were they not generating enough revenue?
In our Wealth Management business, we are rolling out a sleeker Merrill Lynch digital platform with more integration between banking and investing, along with adding industry-leading capabilities of market data, enhanced documents, scanning, and texting capabilities between our advisors and our clients.In Global Banking, we enabled additional cash pro digital capabilities, giving CFOs and treasurers more mobile capabilities and insights to see and move cash at their companies, just as our consumers do.
NPLs, reservable criticized exposure, and delinquencies all declined, while net charge-offs were up $32 million year over year, mostly from seasoning of our credit card portfolio and loan growth.
These transactional accounts -- i.e., consumer non-interest-bearing and low-interest checking accounts -- are the most valuable types of accounts, and these two account categories combined have grown every quarter since 2012, and just since 2015, as shown here, have grown at a compounded annual rate of 9%.We believe this pace of growth and the aggregated level of these account categories is demonstrably better than the market.
This leadership reflects the value customers see in not only our deposit capabilities, but also their total relationship with us, including preferred relationship rewards, simple, transparent products, lower service charges, improved customer service, enhanced mobile capabilities, and improved physical centers.Turning to Slide 8, total loans on an average basis were $931 billion.
As Brian mentioned, competition for commercial loans remains intense, accommodating capital markets are a receptive alternative to bank loans, non-bank lenders have likely increased their market share, and companies remain flush with cash and are generating solid earnings.
Provision expense included a $216 million net reserve release, reflecting improvement in our consumer real estate and energy portfolios as well as other more broad-based commercial improvements.Turning to Slide 10, we break out credit quality metrics on both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios.
Higher interest rates and deposit growth also drove the linked-quarter improvement, aided by an additional day of interest.Net interest yield improved 6 basis points year over year and 4 basis points linked quarter.
In fact, if you recall, Brian mentioned last quarter that we increased our budgets for new initiative spending starting this quarter by $75 million per quarter through the end of 2019.Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 13, another outstanding quarter for this segment as client balances grew, revenues increased, and expenses were down.
Consumer Banking created nearly 1,000 basis points of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 7% while expenses were down 2%.Engagement with customers was strong.
Customer satisfaction in consumer banking reached a new high with more than 80% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale.This improvement in customer satisfaction is clearly an important factor, driving the strong growth in customer balance, as I mentioned a moment ago, and we are achieving this growth while lowering expenses.
Strong client activity and a healthy equity market, coupled with solid expense management, all benefited results.We are asking Merrill Lynch advisors to improve organic growth and we embedded incentives in our 2018 compensation program to drive responsible, organic household growth.
Year-over-year client balances rose to record levels of more than $2.8 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows, and continued loan growth.
Year-over-year revenue growth of 4% was led by a 9% increase in asset management fees and modestly higher NII, partially offset by lower transactional revenue.Turning to Slide 18, Global Banking earned slightly less than $2 billion and generated a 19% return on allocated capital.
Expenses were held flat versus Q3 '17 despite our continued investments in the business, including the addition of sales professionals to enhance local market coverage.Looking at trends on Slide 19 and comparing to Q3 last year, at 2% year over year, growth in average loans moderated this quarter while deposits grew 7%.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think the -- Paul actually can speak to this, too, because he was a leader in that business, but the team did a good job across the last several years of repositioning us after the crisis.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorI had two questions.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe question that you're hearing debated as you see some of the consumer spending numbers come up is they're very strong.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi, Matt.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Managing DirectorI was wondering if you could talk about the outlook for net interest income dollars, just given a little bit of the backup on long rates.
D'Onofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerSay that again, Marty.Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- DirectorOther earning assets sequentially was up 55 basis points, so I was just curious why that was up so much this particular quarter.Paul M.
D'Onofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerOther earnings assets was up 55 basis points...do you think it was the margin?Brian T.
D'Onofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerI don't think there's anything unusual in the consumer loan portfolio that's driving those.
What I think investors are missing is there's a lot of headroom to still trickle up those deposit rates and still continue to improve net interest margin.Brian T.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Managing DirectorYou have worked very diligently with your team since 2010 bringing Bank of America to this level of profitability that you reported today, 123 basis points on assets and an ROE of 11%.
Our commercial loan growth, as you've seen in the market, moderated a bit this quarter, but keep in mind that many companies came into the year flush with cash.
This quarter, we're at $2 billion, up 9% from last year, and we continue to acquire new commercial banking clients, so we're optimistic as we continue to add more customers and deepen existing relationships.With respect to credit risk, here, too, we maintained our strong credit culture, and yes, we grew responsibly.
So far this year, we've hired 2,000 people from those communities, and across every line of business, we are hiring client-facing professionals, more relationship managers, more Merrill Lynch advisors, more Merrill Lynch financial advisors, more U.S. Trust advisors, more small business bankers, more business bankers, more commercial bankers, more middle-market investment bankers, and more corporate bankers, and so on.We're using our resources to invest in the future of the franchise, the people who work here, the tools we use to serve our clients, the capabilities our clients value, and the communities we live in.
Growth was strong, even if you adjust for the lower tax rate from the Tax Act. Year over year, pre-tax income -- as Brian noted -- reached a record $9 billion, up 18%.
The tax rate in Q4 should be marginally higher absent unusual items.Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 6, overall, compared to the end of Q2, deposit growth of $36 billion drove an increase in assets of $47 billion.
On this adjusted basis, NII is up $850 million year over year and the net interest yield is up 13 basis points, driven by broad improvement in asset yields relative to funding costs.With respect to deposit pricing, we continue to see a slow upward movement in rate paid and total interest-bearing deposits.
Mobile and ATM now account for more than three-quarters of deposit transactions, and lastly, mobile, with all its benefits for both our customers and our shareholders, is now approaching half of all digital sales.Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 15, GWIM produced another quarter of strong results, earning net income of more than $1 billion, which was the second-highest quarter ever for this segment.
So, that's how I think about the areas where, this quarter, we underperformed a little bit.To Brian's point, having said all that, I think we know we can do better.
One, just on deposits, I know that you spent quite a bit of time going through on Slide 7 the growth rates there.
We and the industry have not increased deposit rates appreciably in traditional consumer bank accounts.I think the reason for that is because Bank of America delivers a lot of value to depositors.
At some point, rates are going to rise in Consumer as well, and our focus is on balancing our customers' needs with the competitive marketplace and our shareholders' interest, and we'll do the right thing.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorAnd, your branch expansions that you're planning on doing over the next several years -- that hasn't materially kicked in yet.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt's been material relative to the start to finish, and we've crossed a $100 million branch, for example, in Denver within three years, which is very strong, but it's not material to the $1.4 trillion deposit base or the $680 billion in Consumer, so it's not contributing -- it will over time, but right now, it's marginally adding.Betsy, a couple things to think about: The amount of investment we've made in the global transaction services platform across the last eight or nine years have been over $2 billion, so those deposits come from the ability to provide better and better services to clients and that investment rate, and that's the thing.
This takes a lot of investment not only on the consumer side, which is obvious with the mobile and everything that you statistically see, but a lot of people forget on the commercial side, the institutional side, there's this likewise investment going on, so that, we think, is competitively advantaged and our customers respond to it.Paul M.
D'Onofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd, those deposits are up 7% year over year, so we're seeing the growth.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorOkay.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat's going to be...I don't know if I have that off the top of my head, Mike, but if there's 130-140 million households plus all the users, I think we have more than our fair share of it.
D'Onofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerI would think about it -- I mean, as we started Q4 -- and, it's early -- the NII growth we're feeling feels a lot like Q3 in terms of the movement in rate paid so far, and so, I would think about it as a year over year growth being something that feels the same this early in the quarter.
But, again, that increase is going to be dependent on several factors, including loan growth, mix shift -- particularly in Global Markets -- you've got the realization of the forward curve, you've got the competitive bottom with respect to deposit rate paid, and again, I would just think about it banking book versus the market's book.
We're seeing the benefits of our strong deposit base, how we've invested in our clients in a rising rate environment -- we're seeing that if you look at the ""banking book."" Obviously, Global Markets is going to impact that number, but if you look at the banking book, I think you get a better reflection of what's going on at the company.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Managing DirectorAll right, that's all helpful.
I just want to follow up on some of the comments you made on loan growth, and I hear you on high competition, good capital markets, non-bank lenders, corporates flush with cash.
D'Onofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerWhat we would emphasize is given the strength of our platform, given the bankers that we're adding, given our relationships globally, we should be able to grow loans the way we've been talking about, even with these forces, even with the non-banks, even with whatever you're seeing out there.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThere's a lot of discussion there, but at the end of the day, we think we can grow loans in the mid-single digits at 2-3% GDP growth, and you've seen us to that, and we'll continue to do that, and the ebbs and flows of the competition will come or go, and we'll be here driving it.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorLoud and clear.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say, Gerard, you've got to be careful because the mix of the business we have versus what people could have been familiar with at different times in our past is with the markets business and the way that business works in terms of ROA and things, but the reality is the team has done a great job of getting this company back to an earnings level, and we expect to continue to grow that, and we continue to expect to reduce the share count -- 1.4 billion reduction since we started.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerRight now, between the dividends and share repurchases -- $6.5 billion this quarter on earnings of $7.2 billion, so it's pushing to 100%.
We continue to perform well in this environment, and we're getting more than our fair share of business, and to do that, we've managed expenses well, drove operating leverage 700 basis points for the quarter.

13,bankofamerica,q4,2018,"Revenue grew a little better than GDP at 3%, and when discussing the growth rate over 2017, we're increasing 2017 baseline as shown to add back the charges taken to the tax act last year.Our client base has expanded, and in our key business, our market leadership positions continued to improve.
And importantly, we believe the same focus on responsible growth and the laser focus on controlling what we can allows us to continue to improve results for 2019.As you can see on Slide 3, every line of business contributed to our growth and earned well above our company's cost of capital, and each line of business had superior efficiency through a focus on operating leverage.
In the fourth quarter alone, we added 70 new clients for our equities team.As you turn to Slide 4, one of the drivers of an expansion in our client base is the fruit of multiple years of continuous improvement in our franchise.
The two programs combined added over $1 billion to all but the top 5% of our team in annual compensation.If you go to the next slide, Slide 6, one of the things that helped us deliver these earnings and growth has been the net increase in net interest income over the last several years.
So, as we look forward into 2019 and consider the debate of whether NII can grow if short-term rate increases stop or slow, we will drive what we control with loan and deposit growth, and even in an unchanged rate environment, that should produce more NII.One of the other areas for improvement has been a continuingly increasing amount of capital we've been able to return to you, our shareholders.
It has more earnings, more capital, but 14% less shares than the peak, and we see much more head.So, we strive to deliver what we control: More customers, more activities from those customers, whether it's loans, whether it's deposits, whether it's assets under management, whether it's underwriting fees, whether it's trading revenue, we continue to drive what we control, and we control the risk and expenses, and we do this while driving our competitive advantage through increasing investments in people, technology, and physical platform.
It sounds like another year of driving responsible growth.Now, before I ask Paul to dive in the quarter, I wanted to give you -- we all are facing a perceived change in the operating environment, with predictions in the year ahead reflecting a range of outcomes from GDP growth in the mid-2s, to lower growth, to recession.
Year-over-year return on assets and equity improved significantly.Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10, overall, compared to the end of Q3, the balance sheet grew $16 billion, driven by commercial loan growth.
RWA decline was driven by lower global markets' RWA and the sale of non-core consumer loans, which offset the impact of loan growth across the businesses.Looking at deposits on Slide 11, overall, average deposits grew 4% year over year.
Also, as mentioned earlier, in global banking, we saw expected rotation from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits.Turning to Slide 12, total loans on an average basis were $934 billion.
As you look forward to 2019, keep in mind Q1 has two less days of interest accrual, which will negatively impact NII by about $200 million.Turning to expenses on Slide 14, we finished the year with another solid quarter of expense management.
The only thing I would note here is with respect to consumer, seasoning drove credit card losses modestly higher, but the loss ratio remained below 3%.Okay, turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 17, Q4 finished a strong year, generating $12 billion in full-year earnings.
And, customer activity in the quarter remained solid across all major product categories.Turning to Slide 18, you can see that 10% revenue growth was driven by NII, as we realized the value of our deposits through our focus on relationship deepening.
Mobile and ATM now account for more than three quarters of deposit transactions, and mobile, with all its benefits for our customers and our shareholders, is now approaching half of all digital sales.Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 20, GWIM produced another quarter of strong results, delivering client flows totaling $35 billion, one of the best quarters of client flows in the company's history, which is partially due to growth in net new households.
The business created more than 400 basis points of operating leverage, growing revenue 7% while holding expense growth to 2%.Revenue included solid growth in NII and non-interest income, overcoming some of the negative impacts of a decline in the financial markets early in the quarter.
On the banking side, we had deposit flows of $21 billion, as some investors increased their allocation of cash, and ending loan balances grew $3 billion.Turning to Slide 22, Global Banking earned $2.1 billion and generated a 20% return on allocated capital.
Revenue of $5.1 billion and pre-tax earnings of $2.8 billion were both up modestly year over year, but this growth is understated given the impact of the tax act on tax-advantaged investments in Q4 '18 versus Q4 '17.Revenue was led by 4% growth in NII from strong deposit growth and higher rates, but was offset by the small decline in investment banking fees.
And, while the market may now believe interest rate hikes have stopped, we believe we can grow net interest income without rate hikes, assuming modest levels of loan and deposit growth.With regard to things that are more in our control, because of all the hard work our employees are doing to eliminate duplicative work and root out inefficiencies, we expect expense in 2019 to be roughly the same as 2018, and as Brian said, we also don't expect any meaningful change in net charge-offs in 2019 based on our years of responsible growth and our view of the credit horizon.So, we enter 2019 positively, with a strong balance sheet and market share in businesses that positions us well for better earnings again in 2019.
Brian, I know you always say it's because you have good team members and everything else, but how much of that growth is due to mobile banking and digital banking, and of that component, how much would be due to millennials?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo, Mike, to put in perspective, I think we had $20-odd billion of fourth quarter '17 to fourth quarter '18 checking account growth in Consumer.
There are not enough millennials to meet those statistics, so this is a broad-based change going on, and whether it's people 80 years old, 70 years old, 60 years old, the way people use the capabilities that we have built for them is across the board.So, any technology adoption -- people often attribute it to millennials, but when you think about that kind of penetration of digital practice and 1.5 billion logins a quarter, 77% of the checks deposited not at the branch -- i.e., through ATMs and mobile deposit -- you just don't have enough millennials to go around.
I've asked this before, but what is your market share of digital banking users -- or, at least, how much of that checking account growth over the last year is due to digital banking?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt's always hard to -- our market share in consumer deposits, we think, is around 13-15% depending on what you calculate, Mike, and it's growing.
If the economy shrinks or something, that's a different question.We sort of think that this model -- all the things you cited in the opening to your question -- is the model, which is grow in a faster economy, keep the expenses flat, keep the credit risk in check, and drive that operating leverage and bring the share count down.
There was a fundamental resetting, obviously, through not only the operating performance, but the tax reform, but now, they'll grind forward a little bit, but they'll be in that range -- 14-16% return on tangible common equity -- and maybe move up higher than that on a given quarter, but I think we're in a solid place right now.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorI appreciate it.
Has anything changed from the past?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think the simple way to put it -- it's all of two weeks into the quarter or whatever -- is that we've seen the normal progression that you see from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, and it's solid out there right now, and the equities business is stronger, as we referenced earlier.
We could always choose not to invest, but I think if you looked at what we're investing in, you'd say, ""Keep going."" Honestly, as a shareholder, it'd be the better answer for the company because the technology investments allow us to take long-term expenses down and things like that.So, there's always leverage you can pull, but that's -- the business model we've been operating for many years now has been to constantly be pulling those levers with time.
So, those are always moving down into our benefit as we move through it, and so, I think if you look at that operating leverage, yeah, if revenues were flat because of whatever's going on out there, we should be able to manage expenses underneath it.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorAnd then, could you speak a little bit to the investment spend that you're making in the investment bank, and in particular, in which geographies you're really looking to increase your market share?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think the U.S. being the biggest...fee pool by far, as people talk about it -- we continue to do that.
Have you taken down the amount you're willing to put on the balance sheet, at least in the short term, or how do we think about how you manage today versus what you did a year ago?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAs I said earlier in response to another question, we're in the moving business, not the storage business as risk goes.
We expect to continue to drive incremental improvement in these businesses as we take advantage of our very strong franchise and continued investments in digitalization and operating efficiency, as well as our relationship management capacity and core products and services.Let me give you a few examples.
This continues to strongly help NII growth.So, you can see these on the right-hand side: Average deposits grew more than $150 billion after the past four years at a 4% compound annual growth rate.
Given our robust funding levels, we expect our parent debt issuances in 2019 will likely be less than maturities.Total shareholder equity increased $3 billion from Q3, as AOCI benefited from increases in the value of our AFS debt securities given the decline in loan and rates.
We returned 95% of net income available to common -- or $6.7 billion -- through the combination of dividends and share repurchases in the quarter.Turning to regulatory metrics, our CET1 standardized ratio improved 22 basis points to 11.6% from Q3 and remains well above our 9.5% requirement.
Strong improvement in our core banking activities was partially offset by the impact of lower-yielding global markets assets.Including our global markets segment, which primarily reflects our trading-related assets, NII from core banking activities grew almost $1 billion year over year, or 9%.
Average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits of 67 basis points rose 12 basis points from Q3 and is up 56 basis points versus Q4 '15, which was the beginning of this Fed rate hike cycle.Turning to asset sensitivity, as of 12/31, an instantaneous 100-basis-point parallel increase in rates above the forward curve is estimated to increase NII by $2.7 billion over the subsequent 12 months.
This expense level includes approximately $1 billion for increased spending in the aggregate in several areas: Normal yearly merit, healthcare benefits, primary from inflation, marketing, and the previously announced new investment initiative spending in technology as well as expansion and modernization of financial centers.On a full-year basis, we believe we should be able to offset these investments through lower FDIC insurance and other efficiencies.
We expect expenses should trend lower than Q1 through the remaining quarters of 2019.Turning to asset quality on Slide 15, asset quality continued to perform very well.
You will also note non-interest income improved year over year from account growth and higher levels of consumer spending.
It's important to note as you look at 2019 that the December drop in equity markets doesn't actually impact AUM fees until Q1 '19 due to the one-month lag in the determination of fees for assets under management.Moving to Slide 21, trends reflected strong client engagement in Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trusts.
Strong household growth and continued near-record-low attrition of experienced financial advisors contributed to the $35 billion in overall client flows this quarter.
Efficiency savings and lower deposit insurance costs more than offset continued investment in the business.Looking at trends on Slide 23 and comparing to Q4 last year, since we already covered loan and deposits, I'll start with IB fees.
Market volatility led to increased client activity, producing revenue and improvements in both derivatives and in client financing activities, where have been recently investing.On Slide 25, I would just point out the chart on the bottom left, which shows at roughly $13 billion in full-year revenues the relative stability of trading and sales over the past three years.
It'll ebb and flow a little bit by market values because of the way it works, but it's really because the equities business -- the investments we made in technologies and capabilities have now turned out into providing balance sheet capacity and capability of the prime brokerage business.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorPerfect.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerWe're not disclosing what our TLAC ratio is, but I will say that as we sit here today, we have a comfortable cushion, and as you also heard in my prepared remarks, the debt issuances this year are likely going to be less than maturities.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Executive DirectorOkay, looking forward to more updates in the future.
Brian, you made an interesting remark at a conference recently in December, noting that you expect through the cycle loss expectations to come in well below 90 basis points, but at the same time, didn't really commit to an explicit level or expectation, and given the late-cycle rhetoric, the focus on -- particularly from long-onlys with longer horizons as to what through-the-cycle loss expectations might be and all the balance sheet cleansing you've accomplished, I was wondering if you could maybe provide us with some sort of benchmark or target expectation that we can compare you guys against versus peers, just given many have provided at least medium-term or through-the-cycle loss expectations already.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerEarlier, I said what I expected for '19 -- charge-offs in the range of where they are now.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerFirst thing to think about as we look at that securities book -- we're always balancing earnings against capital and liquidity.
Longer-term, NIM is really going to depend on the forward curve and our ability to lag deposit rate paid.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Managing DirectorOkay.
Please go ahead.Saul Martinez -- UBS Investment Bank -- Managing DirectorHi, good morning, everybody.
",16.77,0.6402066999999999
14,bankofamerica,q1,2019,"Provision expense is up year-over-year to match those net charge-offs more closely and we had a small reserve build this quarter against the net reserve release last year.Through disciplined capital deployment, after meeting all the requirements to make loans to our customers and support their businesses, we continue to drive our share count lower.
We are well under way with our goal to wring out the dilution in shares caused by the increased capital build after the crisis.Through share buybacks, our diluted shares are down 7% compared to the first quarter of 2018 and down 1.5 billion shares in the past four years.Turning to Slide 3.
We're getting more business as we add relationship management capacity, increase our marketing and drive deeper penetration of U.S. markets through the full franchise entry and more and more markets across the United States.We also continue to invest in our people with industry leading benefit plans, both in health and retirement, with industry-leading capabilities and universities to train and reskill our teammates and plus the pay plan we announced recently, we are going to increase our minimum wage over the next 26 months from $15 an hour plus to $20 an hour.
And as we have discussed many times, our initial spending for technology has been running around $3 billion for many years now, but is currently, the savings (ph) from tax reform expected to be 10% higher in 2019.We continue to enhance both our physical network for delivering products and services to clients, as well as the facilities we operate in communities and countries around the globe.
Customers value the capabilities and rewards of their relationship and continue to see lower attrition and 90% plus primary bank status.
Particularly promising was a strong rebound in our middle market customer base, where we saw growth and line usage increase.
Long-term debt increased $4 billion, common shareholders' equity increased $1.7 billion from Q4, as the value of our AFS debt securities benefited from the decline in long-end interest rates, thereby increasing AOCI.Partially offsetting the increase was the return of more capital than we earned this quarter.
Net interest yield of 2.51% improved 9 basis points year-over-year, but was down 1 basis point linked quarter.Deposit rates in our Wealth Management and Global Banking businesses increased, however, we saw minimal movement in our consumer business.
We also typically see less benefit from loan growth, driven by paydowns on year-end credit card balances in Q2.Finally, long-end rates have fallen across Q1 and remain lower.
This perspective assumes today's forward curve and loan and deposit growth, consistent with the current economic environment.Turning to expenses on Slide 12.
With the expected expense levels for full year 2019 and 2020, as you know, we increased for 2019 our planned level of initiative spending, supporting both physical and digital expansion and we've made announcements of further investments in our people, like our minimum wage increase.
However, please note that the quarterly progression of expenses in 2019 may look a little different than the past years, as it will be impacted by the timing of planned technology and marketing spend.Turning to asset quality on Slide 13.
In Q1, there was also one charge-off related to a single utility client, which increased losses by $84 million, impacting comparisons against both periods.The net charge-off ratio was 43 basis points.
Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to approximate this quarter's $1 billion level for each of the remaining quarters in 2019, assuming current economic conditions continue.On Slide 14, we break out credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios.
Investment assets in the consumer segment ended the quarter up $29 billion from Q1 '18 on solid flows and a Q1 '19 market rebound.
Within revenue, positive impacts from the banking activities and AUM flows were not enough to overcome lower market valuations, declines in transactional revenue and general pricing pressures.
We also saw growth in custom lending.Okay, before discussing Global Banking and Global Markets separately, I know many of you look at these segments together.
These increases more than compensated for a decline in investment banking and loan spread compression.The business created more than 400 basis points of operating leverage, as revenue growth was matched with a 1% decline in expenses.
Lastly, provision expense increased year-over-year, driven by the single-name charge-off mentioned earlier, as well as the absence of the prior year's energy reserve release.Looking at trends on Slide 20 and comparing to Q1 last year, let's focus on IB fees.
Much lower market volatility this year resulted in less client activity and weaker performance in equity derivatives.
The year-over-year expense decline was a reflection of lower revenue-related costs.On Slide 22 you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remained weighted to domestic activity, where fee pools are concentrated.
Within FICCs, we remain more oriented toward credit products than macro.All right, finally on Slide 23, we show All Other, which reported a net loss of $48 million, which was relatively unchanged from the prior year period.
This moved the tax rate in the quarter from our expected full year rate of 19% to the reported 17% rate in Q1.Okay, with that let's open it up to questions.Questions and Answers:Operator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
The third bucket of revenue, which are more market related would be the sales and trading revenue, the investment banking fees and asset management brokerage revenue, which are both dependent on market levels at a given moment and market activity, giving rise to those levels.So, if you think about this quarter versus last year, our market related types of revenue was down 12%.
All in, Bank of America invests around $2 billion a year in capital expenditures to build out, enhance our buildings, facilities and infrastructure.As it relates to our financial centers, our ATMs and other physical build-out, the point is we haven't just announced what we'll do, we're halfway through the broad-based build-out in our consumer business.
The ratio was flat, because the increase in AOCI, mentioned earlier, was offset by higher RWA, primarily in Global Markets.Turning to Slide 11, I want to spend a few moments on NII, given the changes in the rate environment.
The improvement was driven by the value of our deposits, as interest rates rose, as well as loan and deposit growth, partially offset by lower loan spreads.On a linked quarter basis, GAAP NII was down $128 million.
Q1 reflects continued strong momentum from 2018, as deposits grew $23 billion, or 3%, revenue grew 7% and expenses were down 4%, creating operating leverage of 11%.
The business created 360 basis points of year-over-year operating leverage, as expense declined 4%, while revenue was down only modestly.
Strong household growth in both businesses and continued low attrition of experienced financial advisors contributed to the $17 billion in overall client flows.On the banking side, deposits were up $20 billion year-over-year, which included inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds to deposits near the end of 2018.
It sounds like you expect NII to be down sequentially in the second quarter on a few of those pressure points that you mentioned, and then to grow some in the back half, as loan and deposit growth and day count get more favorable.Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, look, we -- we're not a hedge fund, we're a bank and so we are customer-driven, and our asset sensitivity is driven by our loans and our deposits and the activity that our customers do with us.
I'm just looking for some color on how real-time is that, in other words, if we get no hikes for this quarter, next quarter, do you think you see an almost immediate stop in that shift?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think -- Glenn, what I was saying was that the -- you got to look at what drives the value of the consumer deposit franchise in the Company and that's the consumer side.
We have 0.5 million more checking accounts than we did a year ago, to give you a sense, in a book of 34.5 million, went to 35 million.On the non-interest bearing side, the reference was in the commercial side, which, because the way cash management services are priced, when the rates rise, you people have to hold less balances to get the fees, hence (ph) credit rate goes up.
Is that a customer behavior thing, or has Bank of America changed anything on how it charges fees?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe continue to think about and continue to change our policies on overdrafts, which has a downward effect on it.
Just given the current outlook for loan and deposit growth and expectations for expenses to increase year-on-year at least for the remainder of '19, are you still confident, given the NII guidance and your ability, to continue that momentum and deliver positive operating leverage even in the absence of higher rates?Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I mean, look, the way I would think about it is, we've given you guidance on expenses, we've told you that in '19 and '20, we expect that our expenses will be approximately what they were for full year 2018 on an adjusted basis.
Can you give us some color on where you think the efficiency ratio could eventually get to, and you can operate consistently at that level?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell Gerard, I think it's just -- as we said, it continues to drift down.
So, I don't -- if I say to you guys on this call, or my team will say, oh, we made a goal, so the goals to continue to drive it.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystVery good, thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
And then can you speak a little bit to the loan growth side, because we got the NII overall and understand the NIM trajectory here, but can you just give us a sense as to what's in your outlook there for loan growth and if there's any variance between the different buckets that would be helpful to?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think, Betsy just to give you -- for our Company and for the U.S. economy, especially, where we saw some strong -- strong, relatively strong performance was in our middle market business this quarter, in our small business.
So, expect us to see the core loan growth in that mid-single digits and expect maybe a little bit more, but come through the bottom line as the non-core runs off.Betsy, just to follow up on your question to Paul on expenses.
And I'm wondering do you feel that you are fully baked there with your headcount, or is there still some more room to ramp that, and thinking about what the impact is going to be on the loan growth, as you indicated earlier?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo, if you look at it, think about this time last year and into the summer, we continue to look at our position, we've been adding people.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerJust to give you a sense on progress, if you look at hiring year-to-date versus last year in investment banking and capital markets, commercial bankers, it's at three-times the pace as it was last year.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, from a capital perspective, it's going to get phased in over three years.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystYeah, understood.OperatorAnd our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Essentially, are there revenue opportunities that you can control, independent of the macro, if the expenses are kind of lined up and flat and there is not too much more to do there?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think if you think about a growth rate and economy of 2 percentage points or so and you think back about the last decade, we've been at that level more than we've been at any other level.
So, we feel good just grinding out more customer relationships and more loans and deposits and more wealth management business from them and that will give us a pre-tax -- ability to grow pre-tax in the mid- to upper single digits and then the share count through the capital management.So, that's the model of the 2% growth economy.
And how will you know if we are entering a ""new credit cycle""?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell, we continue to -- those are great questions, Nancy, when you think about it in a broader context.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerI'll just point out, I know, you're asking how will we know, but the one thing I do want to stress is, how much we've transformed the Company over the last 10 years by sticking to responsible growth, by changing the mix between consumer and commercial, by focusing on prime and super-prime.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, look, we're -- look I would expect low single-digit year-over-year growth to sort of continue.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerLook, I just think it's good economy and we have high-quality customers in our card portfolio and they're taking some of their excess deposits and paying off their balances.Vivek Juneja -- JPMorgan -- AnalystOkay.
But can you point anything specifically, I think (ph) you're actually seeing an improvement on the commercial side, like line utilization up year-on-year, are you seeing more CapEx spending?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, there has been a lot of talk, if you think about the last couple of years, of the economy -- the last year and a half on economy, and commercial loan growth.
That was down like over $1 billion and that's now flattened out in terms of core linked quarter impact.Second thing is as the small business continues to grow, it does a good job in that and you can see that separately.
As the market settled in and we liked the credit risk better, we've actually seen a little better growth in the commercial real estate segment, very high and very capable, very strong quality, that's helped us a little bit too.And then the last thing, which I think is good news, the economy overall, is the line usage went up about a point in middle market, which is -- which means that -- that's across a lot of lines, obviously.
Was the seasonality impacts greater than the rewards impact in that linked quarter decline in card income and consumer banking?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe impact of -- if charges were up and fees were down, obviously, the impact of the rewards, credits and other credits, both to the merchant and everything else exceeded the growth in the revenue.
",34.06,0.80016506
15,bankofamerica,q2,2019,"However, what we saw on our client base during the second quarter 2019 was solid consumer activity, pointing to a continued growing economy in the United States this year, albeit at a slower pace.
In that environment, our company reported the best earnings quarter in the company's history, that is made possible through the hard work of my 209,000 teammates who are driving responsible growth.We reported $7.3 billion in after-tax net income and $0.74 per share.
In those 18 quarters, you've seen many different market environments, changes in interest rates, economic growth that's sped up or slowed down, but we still managed to drive operating leverage for 4.5 years and successively.
If you look at our digital-only clients, meaning customers have not used a financial center in the past year, we have 30 million consumer customers across our platform who have -- are primary digital who have more than $400 billion in balances with us today.
To better serve the 0.75 million customers that come into our centers every day, this quarter, we added another 17 financial centers to help drive the growth in our consumer business.
Improved the CET1 ratio, while higher loan balances and commitments mitigated some of that improvement.Moving to client activity and starting with average deposits on Slide 9, average deposits grew nearly $75 billion or 6% year-over-year.
Deposits with consumers grew $37 billion or 4% within that global wealth management was up $18 billion year-over-year, reflecting client growth with a preference to hold cash of mid-market uncertainty as well as inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds to deposits near the end of 2018.
Growth of loans to consumers was led by an increase in mortgages as lower interest rates stimulated more originations and allow many of our customers to lower the cost of owning their existing home or buying a new one.
In Q2, we benefited from additional day of interest as well as loan and deposit growth, which was more than offset by three factors.First, lower long term rates resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage-backed securities, which caused higher write-offs of bond premiums.
With LIBOR rates lower than Q1 and the forward curve predicting further declines, we would expect client deposit rates to begin to move lower over the third quarter.Turning to asset sensitivity of our banking book.
If rates follow the forward curve and the fed funds rate were indeed to be cut twice this year starting this month, we think it would likely shave another 1% of NII growth for 2019.Turning to expenses on Slide 12.
We expect increased technology investment in the second half, plus the cost of adding new client-facing professionals to be roughly offset by the seasonally lower incentive costs.
Absent this recovery net charge-offs were just over $1 billion or 43 basis points of average loans and consistent with the net loss of rate ratio in Q1 and the prior year quarter.Outside of the normal expected Q2 seasonality in our credit card portfolio, we had a modest increase in commercial driven by a couple of single name losses.
And in commercial, we also saw a modest decline in non-performing loans, while reservable criticized ratios remained near historic lows.Turning to the business segments, and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 15.
Consumer Banking produced another strong quarter, earnings grew 13% year-over-year to $3.3 billion.
Customer satisfaction improved, asset quality remained strong as a net charge-off ratio was 124 basis points decreasing 4 basis points year-over-year.And I would note that much of the loan growth that we have added to our balance sheet is high quality consumer real estate loans.
However, as with card versus Q1, we saw a modest improvement in service charges.Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 17, strong results were driven by new investment accounts and more traditional banking products as well as the markets rebound in the quarter.
The business created 240 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year, as revenue increased more than 3% and expenses grew 1%.
Within revenue, positive impacts from banking activities and higher rates, growth NII higher, while fee improvements from AUM flows and market valuations more than offset general pricing pressures, with respect to expenses higher revenue related incentives as well as continued investment in new advisors, technology and brand were modestly offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs.
For example, GWIM clients used e-signature twice as much as they did only a year ago.Moving to Slide 18, GWIM results reflect continued solid client engagement in both Merrill and the private bank, strong household growth in both businesses, contributed to the $2.9 trillion in client balances.
On the banking side, deposits of $254 billion were up $18 billion or 7% year-over-year driven by client growth and the desire by some clients to hold more cash amid the market uncertainty.Linked quarter deposit outflows reflected seasonal tax payments by our customers.
Revenue was down modestly year-over-year as loan spread compression and ALM activities offset the benefit of loan and deposit growth.Strong deposit and loan growth reflects the hundreds of bankers we have added as well as continued investment in how we deliver our loan product and treasury service.
With respect to expenses, lower deposit insurance costs, mostly offset continued investment in technology and bankers.Looking at trends on Slide 20 and comparing to Q2 last year.
The decline in equities to $1.1 billion reflects weaker performance in EMEA derivatives compared to a stronger year ago period.Fixed lower revenue was due to a weaker trading environment with lower overall client activity across most products.
The 2% year-over-year expense decline was a reflection of lower revenue related compensation.On Slide 22, you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remains heavily weighted to domestic activity, where a global fee pools are centered.
Remember that if you think about the industry's thought process over the last three years basically as rates rose, that was one thought process in how people price deposits and other things.
And how you know that it's going to continue to fuel that growth, maybe something a little bit more of growth coming from current customer base versus new ones, things like that?
Thanks.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo just starting at end of your question and working backwards, we generated another 1 million plus cards this quarter.
That seems like a big number for such an already big business and the related question is, do you think of there being a ceiling to margins because they're already huge at 29%?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerA couple things.
They got their teams sort of moving along and as you said, growing at a consistent 5%, 6%, 7% depending on the product set, the type of -- whether real estate is lower versus core middle market, and so we feel very good about that.
Brian, I know you touched on this a little bit, but could you talk about your feelings or your ability to maintain the strong checking account growth that you had given the stance on rates paid?
But the one piece you're missing is that in addition to being modestly liability sensitive in the trading book, when you look at those disclosures about the impact of 100 basis point shock on the downgrade scenario on the short end, remember, that's below the forward curve.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analystright.Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerSo you're looking -- you're literally talking about a scenario where short-end rates would be shot down to 75 basis points and long end would be at 1 percentage point.
But when you put all the factors together, you kind of get to roughly 100 basis points -- I mean $100 million on that first rate cut.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystOkay.Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd remember, when I went through the script and talked about how that we still end up growing year-over-year, 2019 versus 2018, you've got to factor in loan and deposit growth.
So maybe if you can speak to some of the factors that are driving more benign impact in terms of the rate sensitivity that you cited versus was explicitly disclosed in the 10-Q, whether it's volume growth, some issues relating to your comparing it versus the forward curve, deposit offsets or anything else you can speak to?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerJust one thing to be precise.
Thank you.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI'll let Paul hit that one just because he talked about it.
So I think Paul said, we'll talk about that next quarter when we know a little bit more.Vivek Juneja -- JP Morgan Chase & Co.
It depends on the rate environment.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerRemember, it really is a question of looking at the different businesses because consumers had checking grow 41 consecutive quarters.
For further information on any forward-looking statements, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or our SEC filings.With that, I'll turn it over to you, Brian.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Lee, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results.
And in the end, responsive growth continued to prove strong earnings, returns and shareholder value.As we look at Slide 3, we start to highlight how we achieved these results.
At the same time, we saw strong investment flows from those customers.Loans in our businesses grew $34 billion or 4%.
As a nice start, we saw market shares across many of the products in investment banking in the first half of this year.
But also, most importantly, the drive we've had toward being the core relationship bank from an American consumer.Now in the recent past, from offsetting those rate of fee reduction by increasing the growth in the actual counts, the number of accounts we have that our primary household relationships in the past last few years.
And at the end of the day, when you look at the total relationships in those consumers, it's great economics for our shareholders.Now next couple of slides, we're going to do something we've done in each of the earnings reports for some time, but we're going to add a piece to it.
This is why we continue to invest heavily in enhancing our number one ranked digital platform while, at the same time, enhancing our best-in-class financial centers.And again, this quarter, you see the interaction of those two in the lower left-hand side of this slide where the record number of appointments that were set up.
Overall, compared to the end of Q1, the balance sheet grew $19 billion driven by loan growth, which ended the quarter more than $20 billion higher in our business segments.
Consumer Banking deposits grew by $19 billion or 3% year-over-year.
As a result of these impacts, net interest yield of 2.44%, declined 7 basis points linked quarter, but was up 3 basis points year-over-year.With respect to deposit rates.
The lower current forward curve also caused increased asset sensitivity in the falling rate scenario.In the second half of the year, we expect NII to benefit from growth in loans and deposits, as well as an additional day of interest in Q3.
Even as we invest in new markets and renovate financial centers, the all-in 162 basis point cost of running the deposit franchise was relatively flat compared to Q2 '18, as the decline in the cost of deposits component offset the increase in rates paid.
Looking at them on a separate basis and beginning with Global Banking on Slide 19, the business earned $1.9 billion and generated a 19% return on allocated capital in the quarter.
Please go ahead.James Mitchell -- The Buckingham Research Group -- AnalystHey, good morning, guys.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerMorning,James Mitchell -- The Buckingham Research Group -- AnalystHey, just might as well ask the question on NII.
The quarterly impact of that is a little more than $175 million, but it'll be even less than that because that $3 billion is measured relative to the forward curve, which already includes rate cuts.
And I think if you look at some of the statistics and materials on the -- especially on the corporate GTS type business that the necessary increase for the highest balance customers and et cetera, that's occurred, will slow down and come back the other way.
But if you look at the more recent quarterly trend, you're going to see that you've seen the impact decline, although it's still going to hit, but you're seeing that help fuel our deposit growth in checking deposits, especially at 6% year-over-year in consumer.
And this year, we'll do 7 million referrals across all the businesses in the markets that we're doing.And so -- and then on the margin, if we move to 29%, as you see that NII type activity as loans and deposits continue to grow, that margin will continue to grow.
And if so, how do you change the price of products for that millennial customer set?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerOne of the things and I don't want to sound perspicacious in terms of people's views of big banks don't do big business with millennials, it's just to set the tone.
The answer is they have in the past, and we expect in the future as long as we keep driving the great experiences we have and going back to the comments on Page 6 to 8 of the slide deck on consumer strategies just look at the activity levels, and those are generally would have a stronger cohort to younger below 40-year old people.
The assumption is that once you get new customers, maybe they will stay with you longer than they would've, say, 10 years ago.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell, that goes back to your colleague's question about the rewards and things like that.
I mean we don't see anything on the horizon to suggest that we can't continue to grow kind of what we've been telling you, which is kind of the low to mid-single digits for the company from the business segments.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI'd just add two thoughts, though.
What's your outlook for that checking account growth to continue or maybe relative to GDP or to the industry?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerIf you look at it, we have maintained that pace.
If you look in the money markets and stuff and see the rates, that's where the people get paid for the excess balances, but this is the money that's flowing through the household on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, and we feel very good about it and figure we can continue it because we have in all the environments and all the rate changes.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystGreat.
So you've got to factor in both of those things.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystNo, understood there, but is the logic right, I guess, is my question that you'll get an offset and that offset is sort of in that magnitude of, for every 25 basis point something in the neighborhood of $75 million on the trading book?Paul M.
So all those things impact it.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystAnd you're also baking in a little bit of a benefit, a little bit of an offset then from expanding margins and trading book on the rate cuts in that guidance?Paul M.
I think this is a result of all the things that we said we were going to do, not that we ever had a problem in Investment Banking.
It's only an impact when the rates go down, you get a live effect on some increase in write-off of premium, and so that's what's going on.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerPaul, just on that this quarter, a couple of basis points of the compression due to the amortization of the premium, which goes away next quarter if rates -- if the tenure doesn't fall by 50 basis points again during the quarter, so -- and another basis point sort of seasonality.
Thanks.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo I think if you think about it over the last two years plus, I think we've ran around $13.1 billion, $13.2 billion, $13.3 billion in quarterly expenses.
But right now, we think '19 is going to come in a couple of hundred million under what we said, which just goes -- by the teammates here is good management.
We just kept driving the basic efficiency of this platform through and we'll continue to do that.And if that comes in to be lower than the number we're talking about for '20 and we get there, it's going to go to you.
And should we assume the timing if you do apparently you use all that is spread even or do you have the flexibility to front end if you wanted to?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYes, we plan to use all of it and it's spread equally over the quarters under the way the method works and the sort of the guidance they gave you.
Brian, you mentioned in your opening remarks just how strong credit is and expected to continue and you guys have talked about charge-offs kind of living in the $900 million to $1 billion range a quarter.
And if we see the -- if we think the environment stays the way it is, that's what we think it's going to be and then provision will follow that.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd when you think about it, cards the number, right?
We all see the employment numbers, which are very strong, but what are you guys seeing both in small business and midsized and larger businesses?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo the core loan growth is strong.
So if you look at the pass-through rate and the down scenario an average we're talking approximately 40%, and again, consumer would be a lot lower, GWIM and Global Banking would be a lot higher kind of in 60%, 65% range.Brian Kleinhanzl -- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And if you think about that, if you add that in the cost of deposit rate paid, you're basically flat year-over-year in total cost of goods sold, for lack of a better term, to produce this wonderful transaction franchise and consumer.
When we were talking about earlier in this call somebody asked about what was the next 25 basis points, and we went through what we thought the impact of that was.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerRight, and I think Paul's statements early in the prepared remarks are exactly what you're saying, which is stable rates and follow the forward curve with the rest of '19.
So what you should focus on is the fact that we grew deposits in Global Banking 12% year-over-year, that reflects the sophistication and value we're bringing clients from that treasury services platform, and it reflects the bankers we've added and the relationships that they have in the US and around the world, 12% growth in a kind of is going at 2% feels good to us.
We're not paying attention to a few basis points here or there.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWe look at the long term, Mike, as you're well aware.
",38.22,0.8165468000000001
16,bankofamerica,q3,2019,"We'll then open up for questions, please try to limit your questions so that we can get to all the callers and for more information on the forward-looking comments we may make, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or the SEC filings.With that, take it away, Brian.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Lee. That's what we've been telling you, which has been what we call responsible growth.The investments we are making in the franchise for many years and our disciplined responsible growth approach or even across every line of business results in respective customer basis you'll see in the materials.
So, before Paul dives into the quarter's results, through the lines of business, I wanted to cover a little bit about client activity, costs and operating leverage at an enterprise level.
This means, the US consumer continues to benefit by strong employment prospects.Now, interesting on the commercial side clients, at roughly $325 billion in average US commercial loans outstanding, we do see a lot of client flows as the market leader in United States.
We have been investing in the client facing team mates in our commercial banking for a few years and we've increased our investment banking covers, especially in the middle market and we've added new traders and sales staff in Europe as we opened our Paris brokerage office.As you can see, these efforts and deepen relationships with 3% growth in solutions for household, customer relationship and commercial.
Since the end of 2015, our average consumer banking deposits are up $145 billion in balances, three quarters that coming from checking accounts.
Our rate paid remains low due to that superior mix of deposits.Now, when you look at global banking in the lower right-hand side of the slide, $23 billion in deposit growth reflects a rising rate environment and the additional bankers we have deployed over the last few years to continue to sell our superior global transaction services, capabilities.
And even as we continue to invest, the cost of deposit year-over-year declined to 150 basis points nearly offsetting the increase in rate paid, which is now 11 basis points.Deposit growth was up $22 billion or 3% and centered in low rate checking.
One of the reasons for growth in deposits and Global Banking has been our consistent investment over multiple years and digital capabilities within our transaction services platform.Referring to slide 19, note the growth in mobile and digital usage at the top of the page, and our focus on solutions for clients on the bottom of the page.
I know there's a lot of moving parts, but given the forward curve and maybe you could also help us think about the premium amortization, year-to-date, what that drag has been and how that would play out in a stable rate environment from here.
I think, we have -- if you go back many quarters ago we discussed, our thought process is to tell our team mates to price to achieve sustainable deposit growth of 3% or more faster in the economy, which means you are in -- point there as you're gaining share at all times if economy is growing less.
So what's your confidence in growing revenues faster than expenses over the next year, even though you're not giving specific guidance, but more generally, what's the role technology inside the firm that's enabling this operating leverage.For example, how many data centers do you have and how many you are going to close, of what percent of your applications, you expect to migrate to the cloud, just a little bit more color on what's happening behind the scenes that enables your operating leverage and your expectation for continuing that.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerNo. And Mike those a good questions.
But the real key is back to your -- sort of your second question, which is we are -- we are getting the benefits of sustained long-term investment in the change, the way this company operates that continue to push through.
One on loan growth, I think, growing loans, core loan, 6% and a 2% world like you described would be considered great by most metrics, just curious if you think that's sustainable, if we're going to sustain 2% world.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah.
So I think it's sustainable and mid-single digits, maybe six a little higher, maybe five, maybe four, maybe six, if economies are two, but this taking market share, because of the deployment of the capabilities into the -- into the middle market and business banking franchise is along with some of the work that's going on with investment banking and others is a good place to be.
And remember that disclosure is beyond the forward curve, which has three rate cuts in it right, but if you look at that disclosure you will see that full 100 basis points would equate to around $3.3 billion on the short end, you just divide by 16, and you're going to get the impact on quarterly basis of about $200 million.
It's going to be -- it's going to be less than $200 million and I'd even tell you it's going to be meaningfully less than $200 million.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerJohn, these things -- I know, you guys would like us to round it out to six digit each time and give it to you [Indecipherable] years, but the reality is, we gave you an estimate for this quarter, last quarter, I mean, fourth quarter -- the current quarter and we gave it to you last quarter.
I realize it's a small piece of the revenue line you've got, but just want to see if you think that this is at all, something that you need to address in the marketplace?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThe -- so, Betsy, let me take that.
Is that a fair way to read it?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThat's really not relevant here, because that's in the wealth management business, where this stuff shows up is actually back in the consumer side, because Merrill Edge is in that area and that's where the lion's share is.
And as you will know and so that's a constant change of fighting the average yield for the total client assets in that business, but that's not affected by this decision.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGot it.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd you -- you will see us push a little bit on some of the qualification for to open up this capability and another set of clients, but we only have 13% less to go, so.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGot it.
You're largely around all the CCAR stuff, but ultimately in some of the work we are doing, but really to get all the data rates actually the parts and things that can operate are operating on good data and that investment then allows us to take advantage of it and we're still in the early days, quotes that we invested in the markets business, so it's from one side of the company, the other.And going to the earlier comment, what target do you have?
Can you get into a little bit more detail, if there is still more that can be done on expenses in there, I mean -- the positive operating leverage with expenses down.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah.
Correct.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I think it's just -- the third quarter was just a little bit of timing.
Just ebbing and flowing on marketing and other areas, which will rebound investments we expect some of that to rebound in the fourth quarter.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd Matt, that's why, if you go back to that earlier page in the deck, why we should.
And whatever doesn't go to loans is going to go into the securities portfolio.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd then you have the markets business, which also because of the financing activities and equities, not a lot of risk, but notional growth of balance sheet that you've seen.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystYeah.
Our loan and deposit growth, above industry averages and above the market on a conservatively responsible growth basis continues to help offset the NII pressure due to rate changes which is -- which all of you are focused on, it should be.
Our total commercial loans grew 6% compared to the third quarter of '18 with good middle market utilization rates.
On a consumer business on the left hand side of the slide, our deposit growth has consistently been above the average -- the industry average for many periods.It's actually dramatic [Phonetic] that we're gaining market share.
And we're expanding the franchise by being our retail franchise, our consumer banking franchise to markets where you had long established wealth management or commercial client coverage.Paul is going to cover the continued growth and digital uses across our client base, which provides an important deal of benefits of strong customer service and lower cost structures.
Earlier there this quarter, my team mate, Tom Montag highlighted some of the gains we are making in middle market investment banking coverage at a conference.
The value of our leading digital capabilities and our unique preferred rewards program.Global wealth manager was responsible for $16 billion of that $38 billion in consumer deposit growth, reflecting client expansion and preference to hold cash and move investments as well as inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds and deposits at year-end 2018.Our consumer banking deposits grew by $22 billion or 3% year-over-year.
Average loans on line of business had grew $52 billion or 6% year-over-year, as both consumer and commercial loans both grew at a 6% pace.Middle market borrowing as I said earlier, continued to complement large corporate financings.
Within consumer, you'll note that strong residential mortgage growth, but also the more stable credit card balances which reflect our decision last year to continue to manage less profitable promotional balances down or driving core balances and our relationship, especially in preferred rewards capabilities.
Part of that is to have sustainable growth, which it means we self fund our investments and find ways to handle the inflationary cost to keep expenses relatively flat -- while, continue to invest heavily, $3 billion in technology, new branches, new team mates.Slide 6 shows a two-year expense trend here.
Despite the immediate revenue impact of a lower interest rate environment and other revenue challenges with a slowing economy, we have a good track record of generating operational savings, we're able to keep it operating leverage relatively flat, essentially expenses and revenue grew about $500 million less than $500 million each.
The year-over-year improvement reflect solid loan and deposit growth as well as modestly higher average short-term rates year-over-year.As you know lower rates are a headwind.
First, lower short-term rates reduce yields on floating-rate assets and second, because of lower long-term rates, we experienced faster prepayments on mortgage-backed securities, increasing the level of bond premium write-offs.Offsetting these negative impacts were one additional day of interest, loan and deposit growth, reduction in the cost of our long-term debt and a small decline in the interest rate paid on deposits.
While NII improved in Global Markets, results are better assessed by studying together, both NII and trading account profits as client activity from one quarter to the next can shift in mix between these two revenue lines.
In any case, this asset sensitivity increased compared to Q2, driven by the forward curve at the end of September, which was lower than the curve at the end of Q2.Looking forward, on our Q2 earnings call, we reviewed our expectation that net interest income could grow roughly 1% for the full year of 2019 over 2018.
Similar to Q2, we sold some non-core consumer real estate loans where the sales price was above our carrying value due to prior charge-offs.This resulted in recoveries that reduced net charge-offs and provision expense in both Q3 and Q2 this year.
We believe our efficiency ratio of 45%, which is one of the lowest among our peers is driven by our digital delivery platform and simplified product offerings which enables not only ease of use, but also efficiency.Our investments in this business continued at a steady pace and client activity remained strong with it back to loan and deposit growth, as well as consumer spending.
Again this quarter, we added salespeople expanded in new and existing markets, renovated financial centers and improved capabilities for consumers, as well as small businesses.
The low long-term rate environment continue to generate momentum and consumer real estate as new originations nearly doubled from last year to more than $20 billion.
Asset [Indecipherable] segment remained strong as the net charge-off ratio was 118 basis points, down modestly from both last year and the previous quarter.In addition, we saw origination spreads improve in both mortgage and consumer vehicle lending during the quarter.
Consumer investment assets grew $19 billion to $223 billion, a strong client flows were partially offset by market declines.Turning to slide 13, note that our 3% year-over-year improvement in revenue was driven by both NII as well as fees.
Within revenue positive impacts from growth in deposits and loans drove NII higher asset management fees grew year-over-year as fees from AUM flows and market valuations more than offset general pricing pressures.
Mobile channel usage among wealth management household grew 45%.Moving to slide 16, GWIM results reflect continued solid client engagement in both Merrill and the private bank.
AUM flows were nearly $6 billion in Q3 or $21 billion in the past 12 months, boosting AUM balances to a record $1.2 trillion.On the banking side, average deposits of $254 billion were up $16 billion or 7% year-over-year driven by client growth and 2018 year-end conversion of balances from money market funds.
Strong deposit and loan growth reflects the benefits of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years, as well as continued advancements in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services.
A few other items impacted results here, first provision benefit from the recoveries totaling $200 million related to the sale of primary non-core consumer real estate loans totaling $1.8 billion.Second, the elevated litigation expense Brian mentioned is booked here.
There were some adjustments made on the wealth management business, if you look back, last year we had some growth there that we slowed down because it was a little to -- tied to bidding too much rate.They change that process, they flattened out, now they are growing again.
How difficult does it become or does it become more difficult to be more proactive in terms of lowering your deposit costs?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI think back to the -- in the earlier discussion that sort of general guidance we give our teams is you have to get us 3%.
On the wealth management side, we're driving not only the investment cash, but all the transactional cash and you have to think of those as two separate executions and putting team mates investing by putting team mates into the Merrill Lynch offices who can help the client associates and others who have always done a good job, doing better job of getting core checking relationships and mortgages and things like that, which will help.
It seems like a pretty attractive environment or good environment for you guys to take share and suck up demand deposits at maybe a faster rate than some of your peers.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI think, yes, we expect to grow at a faster rate than our peers.
Thanks so much.OperatorOur next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystHey guys, just a quick one, Brian, you mentioned that obviously delivering positive operating leverage gets harder with -- and rate environment where it is, but as you look ahead and you've done this good job of keeping this $53 billion or so, what are the incremental things that become more productive underneath that allows you to fund the incremental investments, like do we transition to other parts of the business becoming more productive or other pieces that yeah have it maybe still haven't yet attack that could still provide that underlying support.
As you think about the overall balance sheet should that grow in line with deposits or are there some opportunities to bring down debt and you'll see a little bit less earning asset growth?Paul M.

17,bankofamerica,q4,2019,"At the same time, we deployed capital to support growth for our clients, committees and teammates.Let's start on slide 2; I'm referring to the full year results, excluding our third quarter '19 joint venture impairment charge.
The costs saw all these enhancements incorporated [Phonetic] in our run rate of expenses, providing the capacity to keep investing in the future without increasing expenses.Also for 2019, for the third consecutive year, we shared our financial success with our teammates, with special compensation awards to approximately 95% of them, Three years of special compensation awards, totaled over $1.6 billion, in compensation addition to all other bonuses and merit and everything else, allowing our teammates to do more with their families.Last year, we also delivered more than $5 billion of community development and financing for affordable housing, another important local priority, who made more than $250 million of philanthropic contribution to help drive economic mobility, including workforce training and development and many other local priorities, where we help to make a difference.We also completed our 10 year $125 billion environmental business initiative goal in 2019.
Consumers' record level efficiency and customer satisfaction scores reflect our hard work done the right way.Andy Sieg and Katy Knox together run our Global Wealth and Investment Management businesses.
We generated $1 billion plus in quarterly earnings in the quarters of 2019, and topped this quarter $3 trillion in client balances for the first time.Tom Montag and his team across Global Banking, Global Markets franchises are running one of the biggest commercial lending business in the world and were the top market making investment banking platforms.
Returns remained strong in Q4, but the return on assets of 113 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 15%, well above the company's cost of capital.Our results were driven by our team's focus and solid progress on managing what we can control and gaining market share, in an economy that grew at a low single-digit pace.
Client activity remained solid, allowing the benefits of loan and deposit growth to aid in offsetting the negative impact of lower short-term rates over the past three quarters.
Lastly, our TLAC ratio also remained comfortably above our requirements.Looking at how client activity impacted average balances, let's start with deposits on slide 9.
But I would note, the more stable linked quarter balances here as revolver utilization moved a bit lower.We also saw growth in lending to small businesses growing 7% and within consumer, we saw strong growth of residential mortgages.
The benefits of loan and deposit growth coupled with disciplined pricing, mostly offset the impact across short-term rates of a linked quarter 47 basis point decline in the average fed funds rate.
Third, reinvestment rates are expected to dilute securities yields, despite fractionally higher long-end rates.Moving to Q2, we typically experience seasonally lower NII for two reasons; first, we typically see higher interest expense from funding, increased seasonal Global Markets client activity in equities.
With respect to headcount, year-over-year savings from improved processes and workflows allowed us to fund an increase in the number of sales professionals, as our LOBs added nearly 4,000 associates over the past 12 months.With respect to outlook, our expectations for expense in 2020 haven't really changed from where we provided it in 2016.
All else equal, this would lower our CET1 ratio by roughly 20 basis points, but as you know, it is phased into regulatory capital evenly through 2023.Okay; turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 15.
Our efforts to move customers past enrollment to engagement in digital capabilities are stronger than ever, and we believe industry-leading.Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 18; strong results were led by growth across AUM loans and deposits, as well as good market conditions in the quarter, but also reflected the headwinds of lower interest rates.
With $256 billion in deposits, this segment would rank stand-alone as the seventh or eighth largest bank in the U.S. Asset Management fees grew 5% year-over-year due to higher market valuations, and the fees from AUM flows, which more than offset general pricing pressures and lower transactional revenue.Expenses decreased slightly, as investments in sales professionals technology and our brand were more than offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs.
Average deposits rose 3%.Turning to Global Banking on slide 20; the business earned $2 billion and generated a 20% return on allocated capital in the quarter.
Continued strong deposit and loan growth reflects the benefit of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years, increasing our client coverage, as well as continued advancement in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services.
Bank of America was involved in seven of the Top 10 debt deals, and six of the Top 10 equity deals in the quarter, based upon Dealogic data this performance drove a 50 basis point improvement in market share for the full year.Turning to slide 22, one of the reasons for the growth in deposits and Global Banking has been our consistent investment over multiple years in digital capabilities and transaction services.
And just given some of the moderating U.S. and global GDP growth expectations you cited earlier, just trying to think about how we should be modeling or forecasting fee income expectations in the coming years?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerI think each category -- if you think about the broad categories, where most of them come through, the strategy in the consumer business has been to reduce reliance over the last decade plus on penalty fees and things like that.
That's because people are paying us through balances.So I think that Steven, a guy like me who has been around banks for a long time, the differentiation between types of revenue fee versus spread is becoming harder as the business models have morphed them together in just terms of total revenue.
So it's a complex set of things, but hopefully that gives you some colorMike Mayo -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystYeah, I guess I'll try one more time, in terms of [Phonetic] your check number, like you are expanding to new markets, you are opening new branches, you are hiring new associates, how much does this investing increase the growth rate of expenses?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerIt's $3.3 billion.
The only thing that works against that is -- so yes, if you thought about how much is going to sort of new business initiatives, the mobile banking feature functionality, it's higher in 2020 than it was in '19 than it was in '18, largely around this issue that you are running off some of these long-term projects, which is good.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystAll right, thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
We also have to manage our cost base carefully, while making the required investments, and we have to take advantage of a strong balance sheet to provide good capital return to our shareholders.At Bank of America, we checked the box in all of these in the quarter.
The team continues to get its fair share of the fee pools across the globe and became the more important partners for many of the world's largest clients.With a renewed focus, our Investment Banking team had gained some of the lost market share from a couple of years ago, and Paul will give you those numbers later.
At Bank of America, spending by our consumers grew at 5.9% over $3 trillion in spending from 2019 over 2018.We saw solid loan demand in our commercial client base throughout the year, but that moderated in the second half of the year, as worries about global economic uncertainty and all the issues that are talked about, have been dragged on.
Global Banking deposits grew $19 billion or 5% year-over-year, and reflected both our strong GTS platform, and the additional bankers we have deployed over the past couple of years.Looking at average loans on slide 10, we see pretty consistent client activity.
On the other hand, in Global Banking and Wealth Management, the decline from Q3 and the rate paid on interest bearing deposits, was more in line with the 38 basis point drop in average one month LIBOR.Looking forward, as we move into 2020, let me start by saying, our expectations assume a stable economic and interest rate environment, i.e. flat rates relative to the end of the year.
From there, we would expect NII to rise modestly in the second half of the year, driven by an additional day of interest and continued loan and deposit growth.Turning to slide 12 and quarterly expenses over the past two years; at $13.2 billion this quarter, expenses were 1% higher than Q4 '18, as increased investments throughout 2019 in people, real estate and technology initiatives were largely offset by savings from operational excellence and lower amortization of intangibles.
Client investments increased $54 billion, up 29% year-over-year to $240 billion driven primarily by the market, but we also saw $20 billion of client flows and our total net accounts grew 7%.Loans were up a healthy 7%, driven by home loans, debit and credit spending by our customers was up 6% year-over-year, consistent with a record holiday season, and asset quality in this segment remained strong, with a net charge off ratio of 118 basis points, down modestly from last year.Turning to slide 16; I will quickly note continued positive trends across deposits, loans and investments, all of which I touched upon earlier.
So when rates fall, [Indecipherable] feels it, but much of the impact of foreign rates was offset by advisory fees, generated from our industry-leading Wealth Management platform.Net income was just over $1 billion, down 4% from Q4 '18, reflecting lower interest rates and the absence of a prior year gain from the sale of a non-core asset, which also impacted the revenue comparisons.
Global Markets produced $639 million of earnings, year-over-year revenue was up 10%, from both higher sales and trading results, and improved investment banking fees.
We run and invest in the company for the long-term sustainability and for growth, and by the way these investments over many years lay the foundation for operating leverage.So having said all that, we're not blind to changes in the operating environment, but we are also not managing rigidly to quarterly financial metrics.
We are focused on the things that we can control, like driving client activity, deposits, loans, investments, efficiency improvements, we are focused on operational excellence.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerI think it's more a reflection of responsible growth, and how we run -- how we're focused on the customer and how we're focused on total revenue, and not necessarily NII or fees.
So I think that line is going to start to grow from here.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerI think, Glenn, just to be -- with Paul's lost point, production of new customers taking the card product from us and the usage continues to grow.
But there's a lot of things forward, and I think we can continue to improve them.It would appear to be easier -- if in fact rates stay stable and drive loan growth, which is what our projection is, and if rates start rising again, it will -- we will look like heroes in terms of margin, but we've been able to sustain it, even in a falling rate environment.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore -- AnalystThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
But remember, that part of the strategy is to invest in our client base, loyalty to our company and our products, and so there'll be modest, because of the NII growth -- think about 8% growth in checking balances year-over-year in consumer, that is helped driven by people consolidating a relationship with you, what you pay back to the reward system through the card usage.
So got to get revenue slightly faster than the economy and have the expenses grow below that by couple hundred basis points, and we've been able to do that, and as this twist in rates ends this quarter, you'll see us get back on track, as we move through 2020.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThanks for that color, Brian, and maybe just a follow-up for you Paul.
And I'm just wondering, as we prepare for CECL, does that inform your appetite or your willingness to continue down the same path, and just separately, just given the strength of your credit position and a relatively clean balance sheet, was sort of hoping you guys could be CECL pioneers, and maybe the first bank to provide some more concrete guidance, in terms of day two provision impacts or expectations?Paul M.
When you're doing $60 billion in deposit growth and your loan balances grew by $10 billion or whatever -- $10 billion or $20 billion, the other half has to go to be invested somewhere and you're raising this money in all-in costs in the 40 basis points of deposit pricing across the whole board, and a lot of it's coming in non-interest.
Please go ahead.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, good morning.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystBrian, 10 years of excellent management here, driving the bus on improving operating leverage, especially over the past three, four years.
Can you give us a sense, as to how you see the rate of change go from here, because we've had obviously significant improvement in the consumer side, and the question I get from people is, is it over and by the way, how do you generate positive operating leverage in global banks and global markets, given the skew to producers, and is there that much opportunity in the back office side?
Leave aside that the rate environment is low, we've been able to push forward the activities that can produce more efficiency, and we think that there is a lot ahead of us.And so I'd like to -- we'd say nice start to our team, saying thanks for all the hard work you've done.
If you think about the cost of deposits and consumer, I think it went down by 4 basis points year-over-year something like that.So it's a grind, and it's a lot of hard work, but the incremental efficiency that we can get at this scale, by these investments and by the digitization and the further taking out of activity which costs more.
And by the time you get to the third quarter, we would expect, assuming the current sort of economic environment, we would expect our loan and deposit growth, the lack of that seasonality, the deposit pricing to have an effect and we'll start growing again.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerI'd just add to that, your question and John's question go the same direction, which is, you've got this quarter and the first couple of quarters because of the dynamics Paul just described that.
How do we think about when, in the current rate environment, the sort of net interest margin, assuming mix is unchanged, obviously it's a big assumption, but do we assume that NIM starts to stabilize in the second half of this year?Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerI think if you look at page 9, when you have rate movement due to the types of things that are -- reestablish the reserve levels by the Federal Reserve, etc, etc, etc, that's going to affect the lower -- our markets business in the lower right hand, and banking, stuff like that.
So if you could just put a wrapper around the spending and put a number to it, then we, as analysts, can figure out, OK, a more core efficiency level, if you would.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerSo one of the things that just in our efficiency ratio compared to other people, or 58% for the year.
What are [Indecipherable] and where do you think they are headed?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerYeah, the $3 billion plus, obviously with Brexit behind us with -- by the regulatory environment rules behind us in terms of implementing the CCAR and the capital rules and then lot of modeling, and you're still spending money improving that data to make those models work.
When you move it from the paper to the digital, can you share -- remind us what the cost savings are when you do that, per unit?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerSo that was kind of checks written by our customers, which is this good point, because that stops the thing before it starts.
If you could comment on that, if you're seeing that in your customer base as well?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerI'll take the second half and I will let Paul.
So that's just smaller, so I think that helps the overall nominal growth for the company.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerIt's going to be $1.5 billion, $2 billion a quarter.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay.

18,bankofamerica,q1,2020,"Global Markets client's needs for liquidity temporarily increased our balance sheet during the quarter by as much as $130 billion from year-end.
Small business originations, not from any of the special programs were $2.4 billion during this quarter, showing support for that segment of the economy.We also met our larger commercial borrowing customers' demands with commercial loans increasing $67 billion as clients drew down against their unfunded commitments and new commitments were made.
And as you know, during the quarter we voluntary chose to suspend the buyback portion of those distributions to share capital for expected customer growth.We did all of that and our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.8% still finished 130 basis points above our 9.5% minimum.
Driving that increase was deposits, increasing $149 billion, far exceeding our $67 billion expansion in our loan portfolio.Moving away from the balance sheet and onto earnings, a couple of highlights, I'd point out and I finished a bit better than expected at $12.3 billion on an FTE basis, flat with fourth quarter.
As those markets opened up, we also saw a strong debt capital markets issuance to support clients.In fact, March ended up being the business month ever for U.S. high-grade market with approximately $260 billion of total issuances.
Again the investments made over the past years to our trading platforms delivered more speed and capacity to make that possible, and all doing we'll remain at maintaining good controls.The clients we serve in that business had witnessed severe volatility markets and we are providing liquidity when they need it.
45% of these fundings came from large commercial clients; 40% were from large corporate bank customers and remainder is spread across all the businesses.As for the asset quality what we funded 92% of these were collateralized or were made to investment grade clients and less than a $100 million were made to clients as loans became non-performing.
Year-over-year average growth has been consistently in the mid-single-digit range and early Q1 trends were similar to that, note the significant increases across consumer and GWIM which was driven by residential mortgage, given continued low interest rates.This quarter we originated $19 billion in first mortgage loans retaining 94% on our books.
Average credit card loans were down a bit more than the typical seasonality given the drop-off in consumer spending later in the quarter, while customer payment rates continued at a fairly steady pace.
The lower rates also allowed us to price our deposits more efficiently in wealth management and global banking.Before I discuss our forward view of NII, I want to emphasize that future NII results will be influenced by interest rates as well as loan and deposit balances which will likely be highly influenced by the virus' impact on the economy.
On the short end, one month LIBOR, which impacted variable-rate loan pricing as well as longer term rates which impacted mortgage and mortgage-related assets have both dropped nearly 80 basis points on a spot basis.As you think about our NII for the rest of the year.
Banking book sensitivity from an instantaneous parallel drop of 100 basis points in rate at that time was estimated to reduce NII by $6.5 billion over the following 12 months.
Since these rates moved less than 100 basis points, the change in NII over the next 12 months is likely to be less than $6.5 billion.I would also note some additional items to consider that are expected to mitigate some of that decline.
Considering all these factors, particularly the virus' impact on the economy and interest rates, we believe NII could approach $11 billion in Q2 and then begin to stabilize with loan and deposit growth mitigating the negative impacts of longer-term asset repricing.Turning to Slide 12 and expenses; at $13.5 billion this quarter, expenses were up 2%.
As you all know, what really impacts banks in recession is not the loans put on your books during stress, but rather the quality of your portfolio booked during the year's leading up to stress.One independent indicator of the relative quality of our balance sheet is the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR stress test.
And our consistent focus on asset quality has been reflected in our results for many years now.Adjusted for the recoveries of loan sales in some periods as described before, we have reported net charge-offs between $900 million and $1 billion for many quarters.
Total net charge-offs this quarter were $1.1 billion or 46 basis points of average loans.
Having said that, given the rise in unemployment claims, we do expect consumer losses to increase later this year and potentially into 2021.Turning to Slide 15, this table provides a full picture of our allowance increased since 12/31/19, including the 01/01/20 implementation of CECL as well as this quarter's build given the worsening economic conditions.
Average loans increased 8% and we continue to add consumer investment accounts and saw solid flows into our Merrill Edge platform.Let's skip Slide 18 as I think I covered much of the trends on Slide 17 already, the ability of our customers to connect through digital banking has never been more important.
But here again pre-tax, pre-provision income was down a more modest 4%.Revenue grew 2% year-over-year as a strong increase in AUM fees and brokerage fees were partially offset by a decline in NII as a result of lower interest rates.
Expenses increased from revenue related incentives as well as investments we made in the past 12 months in sales professionals, technology and our brand.Okay, let's skip Slide 20 and move to global banking on Slide 21.
Lastly, COVID-related credit costs are higher in this segment as the reserve build was more heavily weighted to commercial loans.The business earned $36 million which included adding $1.9 billion to the allowance for credit losses.
On a pre-tax pre-provision income basis, results declined 21% driven by lower interest rates and by roughly $450 million of net markdowns in the value of loans and underwritten commitments recorded at fair value and our capital market books and FVO books.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities, LLC -- AnalystWell, just -- how much -- I mean, how much more could the reserves get built into the second quarter?
As you think about our quarter, our decade-plus long discipline of responsible growth has resulted in a strengthening our balance sheet and making investments in technology and people and talent over the decade has helped us prepare for this environment.Today, we're going to do three things with you.
This was led by the reserve build.I think it's useful to draw your attention to the pre-tax pre-provision income line as we believe it helps illustrate the underlying earnings power of the Company to support the credit costs that are inevitable in a downturn.
And in fact that would have shown that the economy this quarter probably is going to grow faster than people expected.That changed as the virus spread and you can see that -- the impact here on Slide 6.
The request have come down in every one of the last three weeks.And as we've seen -- we turned to April, draw request, new credit request have mitigated these -- at these levels, We're seeing client's attentions turn from securing liquidity to more structured view of their capital position and their needs to better understand how they will prosper and fare in the COVID-19 impact to business model.We observed earlier that as commercial paper market froze the middle of the quarter, as new round of buyers where some clients were unable to access the CPP markets, as the Fed announced their programs we saw that market stabilize and over time here, we've seen it lengthen out so draws can be for long periods of time.It's worth noting, since we have one of the premier global treasury services platform in the world, we saw many of those draws come back in our balance sheet as deposits.
Deposit growth in excess of our loan growth was invested primarily in cash or cash equivalents.As Brian mentioned, the team did an incredible job of not only providing our global markets clients, the needed liquidity from a mid-March spike, but also reducing those levels by the end of the quarter.
I will skip the discussion on average deposits on Slide 8 and move to Slide 9.Earlier, Brian also discussed our loan growth near the end of the quarter, which was driven by revolver draws.
And last, the asset sensitivity of the banking book does not include the benefits to NII of the trading book, which is a little liability sensitive.With that said, we would expect the largest decline in NII over the balance of 2022 to impact Q2, as the bulk of the repricing of our variable-rate loans should happen fairly quickly.
Compared to Q4 '19, expense increased roughly $250 million, reflecting nearly $400 million in seasonally elevated payroll tax expense.With respect to our outlook, we are still assessing the impacts, both positive and negative, that the virus has had on the Company's expenses and as such are not in a position to provide any updates to our previous expectation that expense would be in the mid-$53 billion range this year.
Our reserve build of $3.6 billion reflects the expected increase and life of loan losses given the weaker current and expected economic conditions as a result of the virus.On Slide 14 we breakout the credit quality metrics for both consumer and commercial portfolios.
These ratios reflect our underwriting standards over the past 10 years as well as our loan mix with a large concentration of secured consumer loans.We size the increase to our allowance in the quarter by weighting a number of different scenarios, all of which assumed a recession of various depth and longevity, including an assumption of some tail risk, similar to what is in the severely adverse scenarios.
And as you heard that -- and as you heard, that moved higher in the last few weeks of the quarter.We learned a lot from our digital auto and mortgage experiences and what we learned enabled us to quickly launch a digital pathway for our small businesses to apply for loans in the paycheck protection program.Turning to Wealth -- turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 19; here again, we saw lower rates and COVID-19 related credit cost impact an otherwise solid quarter.
Growth in investment banking fees, loans, and deposits reflected not only what we believe to be a flight to quality in uncertain times, but also the addition of hundreds of bankers over the past few years, increasing and improving client coverage.Turning to Slide 22, Brian covered the most important points around loan and deposit growth, I just want to reiterate one point.
Not only were we able to capture as deposits the bulk of the cash that customers drew on the revolvers that wasn't used to pay down debt or for other purposes, we were also able to attract billions more in additional deposits even as pricing deposits lowered with falling rates.Turning to Slide 23, as in consumer and GWIM, our digital capabilities are more important and useful than ever, enabling clients to work from home and seamlessly manage their treasury needs and it's no surprise that in this environment, we continue to see increased use of these capabilities.Switching to Global Markets on Slide 24.
I know we've been through stress test here for 10 years now, and it would just be helpful to understand how you decided to size this very significant increase in the reserve and how you think it trajects from here?Brian T.
I went back and started saying sort of are we sure how much different we are and you people forget things that it won't mean a lot to the people on the phone, the Gold Option Program, which was a restructuring card debt that went on in the mid-2000s.That was -- it started going into the crisis in 2008 time frames at $25 billion, eight quarters later or six quarters later something like that, it's down to $12 billion.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I mean just to be clear, what I said was it's a significant drop in GDP in the second quarter and then negative GDP growth to extend well into 2021 I think approaching all the way to the end of the year.
We are developing scenarios based upon the information we had at the end of the quarter, but it is interesting and it may be helpful for all of you in terms of comparing reserves to really think about the loan mix, the quality of the portfolio and then, of course, what people assumed about the future.
So our reserve build reflects what we think as of the end of this quarter we're going to have to have in losses for the life of the assets on our books.Now, when we get to the end of the second quarter, we may have a different view of the future.
It's just a little premature to call anything, Mike.And so that's the factors we're looking at as we look at not only, to your point about how you said, potential losses based on our customer base and their behavior and what happens to them; but also based on our view of the economy opening up and frankly our advice to people who wonder as to what parts of the economy could have a faster impact with less -- they're the healthcare experts but with less risk of people congregating versus others that might help support a reopening of good activity.Go back to the dentists or something like that you know that can put dentist back to work that will open up part of the economy that is usually not closed down for these things and it's a relatively few number of people in a given space at a given time.
The -- if you look at U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial in and around 1%, that's obviously a lot more than we've had lately but not necessarily the worst thing you could predict, given the world we're looking at.So I guess my question is, when you talk about the quality and the mix of business and all the things that you gave us, is the -- what I consider not as severe reserve on the commercial side a function of not knowing the timing, the mix of business or it where you sit in the capital stack meaning even if some of those companies who run into issues your historical experience in last bunch of years has been actually really, really good.
Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board & Chief Executive OfficerLook, we've got 2.16% on commercial real estate, given how we have run our commercial real estate business over the last 10 years, especially relative to others, we feel that's up from 1.6% at January 1.
Let's go back to the beginning on the pre-tax PPNR which we all learned at the last crisis that; is that earnings power to absorb pay as you go losses on the consumer side in terms of card charge-offs and things like that or building reserves and then going through on the commercial side, which is what happens typically?That earnings power is, I think, what we feel has us in good stead in terms of the ability -- the ability to absorb whatever circumstances play out here and still with more liquidity than the start of the year, more capital than we need, a 130 basis points more capital and the PPNR volume that lets us drive through it.
And if you think about that PPNR, when you look at this stress test and stuff, we are running a lot higher than those stress tests assume because they assume there's market losses and things like that, which we didn't experience even in the one of the most volatile periods of time in the market's history.And so I think as you play this out that whether we can all talk about the reserve of X or Y or Z per thing, which is what you should -- you all are focused on and should be focused on, the route is, is how much earnings capacity you have to keep generating capital and keep generating earnings that you can offset whatever comes at you and that's what we feel good about.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystThank you, both.Brian T.
But I would think as you kind of look to the back half this year and beyond, some of those line drawdowns in commercial start to get paid off so that maybe it's tougher to grow the balance sheet or maybe it's tougher to grow loans if that's the right way to think about it.Brian T.
Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I mean there is no question that commercial revolver lines which spiked in March will start to pay down once economic conditions start to improve, but obviously the timing of that is very uncertain.
All that's factored into our perspective that we think with loan and deposit growth we can -- you will see NII kind of at that $11 billion level, give or take roughly through the end of the year.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystSo when you say, with all the cash that's sitting on the balance sheet and like you said earlier, you're expecting some tapering of that.
Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board & Chief Executive OfficerJust start on that, just -- generally customers put more cash and you saw that in the wealth management deposits being up $19 billion.
My guess is two-thirds of that was more what you're speaking about a third or so was sort of the core growth building up that we saw coming into the tail end of last year into the quarter, maybe a little less than that.But a lot of it was moving.
Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board & Chief Executive OfficerNo. Okay, another one, and small business, the deferrals that you've seen so far probably going to rise.

19,citicorp,q4,2017,"We did have a decline in markets revenue due to a less robust environment this quarter than in the period following the U.S. election last year but engagement remained strong with our target clients.For the full year, on an operating basis, we earned $15.8 billion in net income for 2017, which was nearly $1 billion more than in 2016, and our earnings per share were $5.33, up 13% from 2016.
Importantly, we remain on track to return at least $60 billion of capital in aggregate over the 2017, 2018, and 2019 CCAR cycles, subject, of course, to regulatory approval.On an ongoing basis, we expect to benefit from a lower effective tax rate going from the low 30% range down to an estimated 25% rate in 2018 with a line of sight to a 24% rate over the next two years.
And finally, the combination of a lower tax rate and therefore higher net income along with the $22 billion reduction in our tangible common equity is expected to drive a material improvement in returns, adding roughly 200 basis points to our ROTCE going forward.Turning to Slide 4, for the remainder of this presentation, we show a fourth-quarter and full-year results excluding the impact of tax reform in order to better describe our underlying trends.
Total expenses remained flat, driving over 150 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio, to just under 58%, and net income grew 6%, resulting in a 13% increase in earnings per share, including the impact of share buybacks.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 5% year over year to $667 billion as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corp Other.GCB and ICG loans grew by $41 billion in total with contribution from every region and consumer as well as TTS, the private bank, and traditional corporate lending.
This represents the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in our global consumer earnings, which we expect to translate into year-over-year earnings growth in 2018.From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs even as we continue to shrink our physical branch footprint.
However, we continue to believe an outlook for pre-tax losses of $250 million to $300 million per quarter in Corp Other is a fair run rate to expect through 2018.Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends split by core accrual revenue, trading-related revenue, and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corp Other.As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.2 billion in the fourth quarter was essentially flat to last year.
As we look to 2018, we expect core accrual net interest revenues to grow by another $2.5 billion year over year, driven by loan growth, mix improvement, and the benefit of higher rates, assuming one additional fed rate increase midyear.
Our supplementary leverage ratio declined to 6.7%, and our tangible book value per share declined to $60.40, including the full impact of the $22 billion non-cash charge related to tax reform.In summary, we made good progress in 2017, with broad-based revenue growth, positive operating leverage, earnings growth, and a sizable return of capital to our shareholders.
What are your thoughts there?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYea. When we think in terms of the dampening of some of the new terms, I think that when we, for instance, just to point to one example, when we renewed the American contract a couple of years ago, we talked to the fact that there was some additional revenue-sharing that came into play beginning in 2018.
As far as the acceleration of revenue, yes, the expectation would be revenue growth should accelerate in the second half of 2018 and then be fully visible from a full-year point of view in 2019, again, all excluding the impact that you're going to see quarter to quarter as a result of the sale of the Hilton portfolio.John McDonald -- Sanford Bernstein -- AnalystOK.
Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and [Inaudible] in Mexico consumer as well as the Asia on a core basis and maybe what kind of revenue growth expectations you might have on the international consumer front?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYea, I'd say that from the medium-term point of view, John, what we're seeing now gives us confidence in those projections that we put forward for Investor Day. So, I don't want you to think that we are upping the guidance from Investor Day, but with this performance, as I mentioned, let's stay with Mexico card, where about six quarters in a row we saw a declining revenue growth year over year in cards.
At the same point in time, retail services, we had, I think, 1% compound annual growth rate and we feel pretty good now about that looking more like a 2% growth rate, and then some additional strength coming in in retail banking as a result of the strong Citigold offering that we've got.
Thanks, John.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystHey, good morning.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerHey, Jim.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystJust maybe on the efficiency ratio, I think you've got it to a 100-basis-point improvement in 2018 but I think the target for 2020 is the low 50s, and 100 basis points will get you closer to, I guess, 57.
Well, I don't put words in your mouth.How much of it relates to toward the teaser and the promotional books and the transactor books and does that run off at the same pace at as you talked about the revenue improvement?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYea, broadly, we would expect that NIR in branded cards to also improve, the NIR percentage, to improve in the back end of this year, 2018, and then continue to show improvement on a full-year basis in 2019.
It seems like it's implying flattish fee revenues, if we kind of just take the math literally, and wondering why fees aren't expected to grow, if that is the right interpretation and just some puts and takes on the fee business.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerI don't have my line-item detail on 2018 but I don't think you're getting to the right conclusion.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOK maybe just talk about the puts and takes in the fee business where you do think there'll be some growth and where you do think there'll be some challenges.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, we continue to see strong fee growth in our TTS business, just to name one, both in cash fees as well as from the commercial cards business.
I just can't go down line-item detail by business in my head.Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerBut I think, John, if you look at, as an example, fee growth, where you think of where we've seen good growth [Inaudible], where you look in the banking products, where you look at where John talked about market-share gains in M&A, you look at what we've done in terms of the private bank, securities services, lending, those more accrual-type revenues have been strong and, again, we don't see anything in the environment that takes away from the outlook of those remaining strong.
You're in a unique position to give us a view of what it might do to some of the other non-U.S. countries that obviously are not lowering their tax rates.Do you guys have any sense on what this impact may do to some of the countries you're in that could lose businesses that come to the U.S. or something like that?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerGerard, I think it already has at least in rhetoric started to put pressure in particular on some of those higher-tax economies.
Any change in your CAPEX budget or anything else along these lines?Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerSo, Mike, when you go back and you think about what we talked about on Investor Day and the pathway to low 50s efficiency, as John described earlier, there's the concept of balance in there but it's a bit of revenue and it's expense and on the expense side, it's continued expense discipline but at the same time some investments we're making today, as an example, in the digital space where we can convert analog functions to digital functions, improve customer processes and satisfaction, at the same time get costs out.
One is we talked about one of the key elements obviously in driving the revenue growth in branded cards is the continued growth in interest earning balances and there we now have seen that growth, we've got 4% growth we quoted excluding, again, the Hilton portfolio, which is going to give us some noise, but ex the Hilton portfolio, we've gotten now 4% growth in the fourth quarter year over year.
Give us some sense of how you're managing that business.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYea. I mentioned the fact that the revenue growth is actually higher than what we had originally expected.
That's why you're seeing the growth, and you have $2 billion of core accrual net interest revenue growth for the full year, $520 million of that in the fourth quarter but just given the fact that a lot of that is coming off of the corporate loans, it's depressing the overall level of NIM at this point in time.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystYeah.
But it's our intention in the business, the growth is going to look like and feel like more coming from share gains and the consolidation of a leadership position and I think you saw that in a down-revenue, down-wallet year in terms of trading that we actually fared pretty well there, and that's my expectation is that there would be more of that as we go through 2018.
Tax reform could change the sentiment among those making investment decisions from optimism to confidence and become the boost the U.S. economy needs to drive growth higher.The U.S. consumer should also benefit as higher take-home pay could drive either increased discretionary spending or the acceleration of payment of existing debt, each a potential positive outcome from the reduction in tax rates.
In all, tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward.With that, John will go through the presentation and then we'll be happy to answer your questions.
These results include a combined net benefit of roughly $0.08 per share from discrete items that resulted in a lower than expected tax rate as well as a one-time loss in discontinued operations.Excluding these items, our normalized EPS was $1.20 in the fourth quarter.
However, the dollar impact should moderate going forward.Turning now to each business, Slide 6 shows the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars.Net income grew 8% in the fourth quarter as growth in operating margin outpaced the higher cost of credit.
We continued to see positive momentum in Citigold with continued growth in both households and balances with improving penetration of investment products.Turning to branded cards, revenues of $2.2 billion increased slightly from last year.Client engagement remained strong, with average loans growing by 6% and purchase sales up 10% year over year.
The growth in promotional rate balances reflects a strong response to our offers, generating growth in both spending and borrowing activity from new accounts during the promotional period.We continue to be confident in our acquisition strategy and believe the investments we're making today will generate revenue growth as these balances mature.
Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 2% driven by higher average loans.Total expenses for North America consumer were flat to last year, as higher volume-related expenses and investments were offset by efficiency savings.
On a full-year basis, Asia consumer revenues grew by 5% in 2017 and 4% excluding gains.In total, operating expenses grew 5% in the fourth quarter as investment spending and volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings.Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail by region.
The sequential increase in the NCL rate reflected an episodic commercial charge-off while delinquencies continued to improve.Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 10, revenues of $8.1 billion declined 1% from last year as continued strong momentum in banking and securities services was offset by a decline in markets revenues.
Excluding this item, equities revenues declined by 4% from last year, reflecting lower activity in corporate equity derivatives while investor-client engagement remained strong.
And in equities we made solid progress with our target investor clients, improving wallet share and growing client balances in line with our investment plans.Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate Other.Revenues of $746 million declined 13% from last year, driven by the wind-down of legacy assets.
And trading-related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising-rate environment.On Slide 13 we show our key capital metrics.In the fourth quarter our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12.3%, driven by $6.3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends as well as the estimated $6 billion reduction in CET1 capital due to tax reform which, as I noted earlier, had a roughly 40-basis-point impact.
In terms of earnings power, the macro backdrop has only gotten stronger, with all major global markets having returned to growth and the U.S. poised to benefit from a more competitive tax regime.Higher GDP growth or additional U.S. interest rate hikes beyond the one we have embedded in this year's plan would provide a tailwind for us.
In the U.S., while branded cards has gotten off to a slow start, likely delaying growth in that business until 2019, we showed good traction with our Citigold wealth-management investment, and retail services is growing at slightly above our medium-term outlook.
And you mentioned overall even with U.S. card being a little light, your overall consumer revenue trajectory feels good relative to the Investor Day targets?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah if you think about it, what this means is we put up, I think, at Investor Day a compound annual growth rate for U.S.- branded cards of the 3 1/2-year period was going to be 3%.
Maybe you could have piecemeal restructurings or maybe you could still sell off some appreciated assets or do something a little bit faster.Again, even though things are moving in the right direction, maybe you can get there sooner.Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYea and, as I said, we're always open and we're always looking at things and certainly tax reform causes us to take a look but, again, when you look at some of the things you called out, treasury and trade solutions growing 9% in the quarter, 7% in the year, Mexico growing at 6%, those are big upscale businesses that are growing as we would like to grow them at a multiple of GDP but what we don't want to do is fall into the trap of then saying, ""Let's accelerate that faster"" and then start taking outsized growth in the form of balance sheet or other types of risks where we end up stumbling along the way.

20,citicorp,q1,2018,"And, we remain on track to deliver on the targets we announced at Investor Day.Our earnings per share were 24% higher than one year ago as a result of strong business performance, a lower tax rate, and a continued reduction in shares outstanding as we execute our capital return plans.
While fixed income revenues were lower than a year ago, driven by less investor activity, our equities business saw its best quarter in many years, giving us confidence that our investments are delivering results.
Starting on Slide 3, net income of $4.6 billion in the first quarter grew 13% from last year as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate.
EPS grew 24%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.Revenues of $18.9 billion grew 3% from the prior year, reflecting 7% aggregate growth in our consumer and institutional businesses, offset by lower revenues in corp/other as we continued to wind down legacy assets.
Our return on assets was 98 basis points for the quarter, and RoTCE improved to 11.4%.In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 6% year-over-year to $673 billion, as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in corp/other.
And, global cards delivered 3% revenue growth, excluding Hilton, driven by continued growth in loans and purchase sales in every region.Slide 5 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail.
We continue to generate growth in total interest earning balances this quarter, up about 6% year-over-year, excluding Hilton, as recent vintages continue to mature as expected, partially offset by the runoff of non-core balances.Excluding the impact of additional partnership terms that went into effect in January, we delivered roughly 2% underlying revenue growth in our US branded cards business this quarter, consistent with our full year 2018 outlook.Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 2% driven by higher average loans.
We continued to drive transaction volumes to lower cost channels, and digital engagement remains strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users, including 25% growth among mobile users versus last year.Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by 9% year-over-year and we built roughly $119 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning.
And corporate lending revenues of $521 million were up 19%, reflecting loan growth as well as lower hedging costs.Total markets and securities services revenues of $5 billion grew 3% from last year.
However, this was more than offset by lower investor client activity and a less favorable environment in G10 rates and spread products, in particular in March.Equities revenues were up 38%, with growth across all products as volatility trended higher and we saw continued momentum with investor clients, in line with our investment strategy.
This is an improvement from our prior outlook for quarterly losses in the range of $250-300 million based on somewhat higher treasury revenues given the higher rate environment as well as the lower expenses.Slide 10 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends, split by core accrual revenue, trading-related revenue, and the contribution from our legacy assets in corp/other.
Our core accrual net interest margin improved by eight basis points to 354 basis points, driven by the rate increase, loan growth, and lower average cash balances as we use liquidity to fund higher yielding assets.
On a full year basis, we now expect core accrual net interest revenue to grow by over $2.7 billion in 2018 as we vetted the impact of the recent March rate hike to our original outlook, which had called for $2.5 billion of growth, assuming only one fed rate increase in June.Legacy asset related net interest revenues should continue to decline by about $500 million this year as we wind down that portfolio.
Our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12.1% this quarter due to an increase in RWA, driven by loan growth and client activity, as well as $3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, partially offset by net income.
Our tangible book value per share, increased to $61.00.In summary, we made good progress toward our longer-term goal this quarter, with solid revenue growth, positive operating leverage, and a significant improvement in net income and returns.
Second, incentive related comp tends to be a little bit more heavily weighted to the front half of the year, and that's consistent with historic revenue trends in markets.Finally, we're taking the opportunity today to invest in the franchise, both to continue topline momentum as well as to [audio breaks up] counter significant efficiency savings that we've outlined for you at Investor Day. But, altogether, the second half expense profile should set us up well for achieving larger improvements in our efficiency ratio, both in the second half of this year and then into 2019 and into 2020.John McDonald -- Sanford C.
So, just a lot of good overall volumes coming out of Asia.Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche BankConceptually, how much of the franchise -- when we look at the East Asia -- revenues are kind of global corporates doing business versus maybe a notch below, like more local companies?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerMost of our book is focused on serving the needs of the large multinationals.
We can maybe take an educated guess, but if there is any help you can give us in trying to think through how the portfolio is sized today and how much you think you'll end up with in terms of paying balances next year and beyond.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerWe've never talked specifics about the exact dollar amount of promotional balances that we've built up.
Or, are there other factors that we need to consider?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerWe've told you the core accrual net interest revenue should grow $2.7 billion this year.
It's something that we hear from investors quite often, just given that your margins are well above some of your US retail bank peers, whether you expect to see meaningful convergence there and how should we think about the timing?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I don't want to get into guidance for individual product lines within a business.
How much can you say was due to market share gains versus just a better interest rate environment for you guys?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerI don't want to split the revenue growth.
You can pretty quickly run the math between the cost of an analogue phone call versus a digital engagement.When you go on and look at our apps, in terms of your ability to check your balances, to move monies, to make payments, those are three big drivers in what John referenced before, what we laid out on Investor Day around this $1.5 billion of efficiency we think we can get out of our consumer business.
Total revenues of $8.4 billion grew 6% year-over-year, and were up 4% excluding the impact of the Hilton portfolio sale, which resulted in a gain this quarter, partially offset by the loss of operating revenues for a net benefit of about $120 million in our US branded cards business.From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the first quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs, even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 8%, driven by continued growth in deposit margins, growth in investments and loans, and increased commercial banking activity.Average deposits declined 2% year-over-year, including the impact of lower mortgage escrow deposits.
New features will begin to roll out toward the end of the second quarter, followed by a promotional campaign beginning in the third quarter.Turning to branded cards, revenues were roughly flat from last year, excluding the previously mentioned impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio.
And, card revenues grew 13% on continued growth in purchase sales and full rate revolving loans as well as a favorable prior period comparison.Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 7% year-over-year in the first quarter, and were up 6% excluding the benefit of a modest one-time gain.
Revenues of $9.8 billion increased 6% from last year, driven by continued momentum in our accrual businesses as well as a very strong performance in equities this quarter.
Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 10% from last year, generally in line with the overall market and reflecting the timing of episodic deal activity.
Private bank revenues of $904 million grew 21% year-over-year, driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits, as well as improved deposit spreads.
Finally, in securities services, revenues were up 16% driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue.Total operating expenses of $5.5 billion increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of FX translation as well as a higher level of investment spending.
Core accrual net interest revenues grew by $750 million, but this was largely offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the anticipated wind down of legacy assets.On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew slightly, reflecting the December rate hike as well as loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the lower day count.
And, trading related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we saw in the first quarter.On slide 11, we show our key capital metrics.
Looking to the second quarter for total Citigroup, we expect topline growth to continue broadly in line with the pace we set this quarter, at around 3% plus or minus with stronger growth in our operating businesses being offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets.Operating efficiency should again show progress against the prior year period with more significant improvement to come in the second half of the year.
And the tax rate should be closer to 25%.Turning to the businesses in more detail, in consumer we expect continued revenue growth in US retail banking, retail services, Mexico, and Asia.
And, we expect continued revenue growth in our accrual businesses, TTS, corporate lending, private bank, and security services as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network.In addition, we're looking forward to receiving our CCAR results late in the second quarter.
So, think in terms of investment spending being a bit more front end loaded in 2018 and the resulting efficiency benefits then begin to ramp up in the second half of the year.So, when you get growth in the core businesses, we'll certainly have some volume related expenses growing.
Can you elaborate on the revenue strength there in terms of some of the products and what drove that?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerWe saw a lot of good activity coming out of Asia in this quarter.
How much of that is outside volatility this quarter, or do you really think there's some sustainability in that growth?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerI think it's a combination of both.
I think we feel good about the progresses and some of the stickiness that comes with that.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
So, you're not giving us the total balance of the promotional balances -- I'll take it if you could give it to us -- but, what else can you have us look to to be reassured that this strategy is going to pay off for shareholders?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYou're going to see -- we talk about some of the revenue impacts in '18 holding the overall business revenues flat.
But then, you should start to see -- beginning in the third quarter -- that percentage increase and that should give you a fairly good view as to what the future profitability of the business is.If you look at that now -- if you look year-over-year -- even with that percentage declining, we're still getting growth in net interest revenue in US branded cards ex-Hilton.
In the equity side, there's a buildout, but just generally, what are the puts and takes around the businesses?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerAs far as from an equities point of view, we certainly feel really good about the business that we're building in equities.
On LIBOR and the three-month/one-month basis differential that happened this quarter, how did that impact you guys in the NIM?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerVery little.
It's interesting to look at, but it didn't really impact us at all.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan StanleyAnd on trading, same thing?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, it's part of the conversations that you have with clients.
No.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan StanleyWhen I look at the core accrual NIM, the one on Page 10, the 354 this quarter, we can build off of that for the rest of the year, given the forward curve is looking for another couple of rate hikes?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
Thanks.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerWe continue to see credit performing very, very well, whether it be in the North America business, Mexico, or in Asia when it comes to consumer.

21,citicorp,q2,2018,"Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstance.Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Form 10-K.
While fixed income was in line with what we forecasted, our equities business had another strong quarter, up 19% from the year before and our accrual businesses continued to show strong growth across-the-board, especially treasury and trade solutions, security services, corporate lending, and the private bank.Investment banking revenue delivered another solid quarter with good growth in advisory and equity underwriting.
Earlier I mentioned, equities for last quarter we ranked sixth, just outside of our top five target.In consumer, our wealth management capabilities have been enhanced both through branch-based and digital outreach, and we significantly increased the amount of Citigold households here in the U.S. Clearly, U.S. branded cards faced headwinds, but we're seeing underlying momentum that gives us confidence in growth going forward.On the second priority, we continue to drive our digital transformation and invest for growth while self-funding these investment It's through efficiency savings.
EPS grew 27%, including the impact of an 8% reduction and average diluted shares outstanding.Revenues of $18.5 billion grew 2% from the prior year, driven by higher net interest revenues, and expenses were flat as higher volume-related expenses and investments will fully offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets.
Now, before we go into the second quarter in more detail, let me build on some of the comments Mike made earlier on our progress since Investor Day on slide four.We remain committed to improving our ROTCE through a combination of client-led revenue growth, expense discipline, and significant capital return.
Fixed income markets have been challenging, but we've offset this pressure with solid double-digit revenue growth in our accrual businesses: TTS, corporate lending, private bank, and security services.
Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 1% driven by higher average loans.This growth rate is likely to accelerate over the next few quarters, reflecting the recent acquisition of the L.L.Bean card portfolio, which added one $1.5 billion of high-quality receivables at quarter-end.
On slide seven, we show results for international consumer banking, in constant dollars.Second-quarter revenues of $3.2 billion versus 6% with contribution from both regions.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 11%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads, with solid growth across both net interest and fee income.Investment banking revenues of $1.4 billion, were down 7% from last year, as growth in M&A and equity underwriting was more than offset by a very strong prior year comparison in debt underwriting.
Corporate lending revenues of $589 million were up 22%, reflecting loan growth, as well as lower hedging costs.Total markets and security services revenues of 4.5 billion were down 1% from last year.
Total operating expenses of 5.5 billion increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher compensation costs and an increase in business volumes along with higher levels of investment spending partially offset by productivity savings.
This is a further improvement from our prior outlook based on higher treasury revenues given the higher rate environment as well as continued lower infrastructure expenses.Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends.
Trading-related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we saw in the first and second quarters.
How can you frame it for us to feel more comfortable that these businesses are pretty sustainable in somebody's headwinds?Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive Officer -- Citi Jim, first I would say that when we look at the trade rhetoric, it certainly introduced volatility but we haven't yet really started to see any significant changes in behavior.
So, can you walk us through just how U.S. rate curves versus non-U.S. rate curves are affecting how you're looking at deposit growth and what you're paying in different markets and is this the type of improvement that we should start seeing in terms of incremental betas from here?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi No. I'd break it down into two distinct categories, Ken. Where we see a real difference so far is in U.S. retail sensitivity and those Betas that we've actually realized to date have lagged our estimates.
There's a lot of curves for us to watch, you guys watch them all the time, but it seems like there's probably hasn't been that much change lately.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi No, not really.Ken Usdin -- Analyst -- Jeferries Okay.
So just, if you can give us your thoughts on how the capital planning process is evolving.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Yeah.
We're on track to bring our efficiency ratio down to roughly 57% with a return on assets above 90 basis points.With that, John will go through the presentation and then we'd be happy to take your questions, John?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Thanks a lot, Mike, and good morning everyone.
net income of $4.5 billion in the second quarter grew 16% from last year as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs, and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate.
GCB and ICG loans grew by $40 billion in total, with contribution from every region in consumer, as well as TTS, the Private Bank, and traditional corporate lending.Now, looking at the first half of 2018, we generated modest revenue growth and positive operating leverage with roughly 90 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio.
We've ramped up investments across the franchise to support this client lead growth.But over the past year, we've been able to fully offset this additional spend and volume-driven growth through efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, resulting in flat expenses in total.
Global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the second quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint.
So together, the Visa B gain and the repricing actions, are neutral to revenues in 2018.In total, we continue to expect branded card revenues, excluding built-in, to be roughly flat this year on a reported basis with around 2% underlying growth, driven by: continued strong client engagement, loan growth, and improved mix.
Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by eight 8% year-over-year, and we built roughly $117 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning.Our NCL rate in U.S. brands and cards was 304 basis points, in line with an NCL rate in the range of 3% for 2018.
Card revenues grew 9% on continued growth in purchase sales and full-rate revolving loans.Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 2% year-over-year in the second quarter, and were up 4% excluding the benefit of a modest one-time gain in the prior year.
Excluding the onetime gain last year, card revenues also grew 4% on continued growth in loans and purchase sales.In total, operating expenses were up 4% in the second quarter, as investment spending in volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Private bank revenues of $848 million grew 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in clients, loans, and investments, as well as improved deposit spreads.
As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.7 billion this quarter grew roughly 4% from last year, as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue, as well as the wind down of legacy assets in corp other.
Expenses should continue to decline sequentially in both the third and fourth quarters.This should keep us on pace to again deliver roughly a 100 basis points of efficiency improvement, similar to what we achieved in the first-half of the year.
It sounds like that's going to accelerate next year to kind of a two 200-basis- point improvement pace, starting next year, I guess.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi I would put it this way, John.
But, yeah, it will be 400-basis-points of improvement over the next two years and we will get to a low 50's operating efficiency in 2020.John McDonald -- Analyst -- Bernstein Got you.
Is at a pace that you can maintain going forward or some factors that we should keep in mind that were special this quarter?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Well there, big guy, all right.
But again, over the next two and a half years [inaudible] at or close to that 10% CAGR that we put out at Investor Day.John McDonald -- Analyst -- Bernstein Got it, thank you.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Okay.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with The Buckingham Research.Jim Mitchell -- Analyst -- The Buckingham Research Hey, good morning.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Hey, Jim.Jim Mitchell -- Analyst -- The Buckingham Research Maybe just a follow-up on the growth outside the U.S., it's obviously been ticking up.
But I think we would look at a combination of both: revenue growth investments and continued efficiency.
So we haven't made any decisions yet, but I think the important thing from an investor point of view is the understanding that the $2.5 billion is going to be higher.Jim Mitchell -- Analyst -- The Buckingham Research Right.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi We're not struggling to get to the $2.5 billion.Jim Mitchell -- Analyst -- The Buckingham Research Right.
Thanks.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi All right.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with the Deutsche Bank.Matt O'Connor -- Analyst -- Deutsche Bank Hi.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Hey, Matt.Matt O'Connor -- Analyst -- Deutsche Bank On the efficiency, you talked about the full-year improvement in 2018 of about a 100 basis point.
But again, we do like what we're seeing right now in those underlying drivers, and it certainly has given us the confidence in the fact that this is a business that this year, flat revenues with a 2% underlying growth, then next year, we should be able to see something around maybe a 2% growth overall, even with the grow over that we've got to do with helping in the vis-à-vis gain.Matt O'Connor -- Analyst -- Deutsche Bank Okay.
A lot of times, the consensus estimates wind up having efficiency going a lot lower and then you say, ""Well, we have to invest more in Mexico or we have to invest more in credit card, we have to invest more in something else."" So, the big picture about investing versus harvesting and then the specifics, why can't you have more than a 100 basic points of efficiency saves this year?Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive Officer -- Citi Well, I'll start with the first part.
So, all of that is embedded in that, that's about half of it.Then the other half is somewhat split 50-50, 60-40 between the Consumer Business and Corporate Treasury, where we continue to benefit from the higher rates and then consumer, from the growth in volumes particularly some of the volumes we talked about in Asia, in Mexico and now with the growth of the full rate interest-earning balances in branded cards.So, all of that is embedded but it's, I don't want you to think that it was just a phenomenon that suddenly happened in the second quarter, it's actually two quarters in a row now of what I would call fairly good sequential growth in our net interest income.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst -- Morgan Stanley Okay.
Appreciate it thank you.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Not a problem, Gerard.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.Erika Najarian -- Analyst -- Bank of America Hi, I thought I help you get to the record number of card questions as well.
One, on the Corp/other you mentioned there's going to be 1-150 over the remainder of 2018, but is the expectation then that it kind of tracks lower from there, as anything improves from there as the legacy assets roll off into '19 and '20?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi I'm going to get to '19 and '20 when we're closer to the fall at the next thing.
I mean, what can you do to get Mexico back up toward the target?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi It was basically the revenue growth, Brian, is tracking slightly below target.
Is it just loan growth is weaker than expected, is it?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Deposits, I would say.

22,citicorp,q3,2018,"In Asia, we saw some headwinds in our more market-sensitive investment products, but the remainder of the franchise showed consistent growth and in the US we're starting to see the impact of the L.L.Bean portfolio in retail services where revenue continued to grow.Branded cards had sequential revenue growth and given strong growth in interest-earning balances, we remain on course to achieve 2% underlying revenue growth for the year.
And this year, our results include a gain of roughly $250 million on the sale of our Mexico asset management business in consumer.In constant dollars, total revenues excluding these gains grew by 4% in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in our institutional franchise.
GCB and ICG loans grew by 6%, or $37 billion in total, with contributions from every region in consumer, as well as TTS, the private bank, and traditional corporate lending.Looking at year-to-date results on Slide 4, you can see aggregate revenues in our consumer and institutional businesses have grown 4% this year, excluding the previously mentioned gains.
On an underlying basis, institutional revenues have grown 4%, in-line with our medium-term expectations, driven by our accrual businesses in treasury and trade solutions, securities services, lending, and the private bank.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 1% in the third quarter, a slower pace than we saw in the first-half of the year, largely reflecting lower episodic transaction activity in commercial banking, as well as increasing rate sensitivity.
In aggregate, deposits and assets under management grew slightly year-over-year, as strong growth in Citigold households and balances more than offset other outflows.Turning to branded cards, revenues were down 3% from last year, including the impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio, as well as previously mentioned partnership terms that went into effect earlier this year.
We expect the NIR percentage to continue to improve in the fourth quarter, resulting in year-over-year spread expansion that should continue into 2019.For the full-year, we continue to expect reported revenues in branded cards to be roughly flat, however, we remain on-track to achieve 2% underlying growth.
In Latin America, excluding the gain, total consumer revenues grew 8% driven by continued volume growth across commercial, mortgage, and card loans, as well as deposits.Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the third quarter, as continued growth in deposit, lending, and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues given a weaker market sentiment.
Over the last 12 months, Asia consumer revenues grew 4%, in-line with our medium-term expectations, driven by 5% growth in revenues, excluding investment products.
The sequential increase in the NCL rate in Latin America reflected an episodic commercial charge-off that was fully offset by a related loan loss reserve release, and therefore neutral to cost of credit.Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 9, excluding the impact of a prior year gain, revenues of $9.2 billion increased 4% in the third quarter and were also up 4% on a year-to-date basis with strength in both banking and markets.
On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew approximately $270 million, reflecting the benefit of higher rates, as well as loan growth, along with the impact of one additional day in the quarter.
However, core accrual net interest margin remained flat on a sequential basis, as the benefits of higher rates and loan growth were offset by higher average cash balances during the quarter.Year-to-date, core accrual revenue grew by over $2.7 billion year-over-year and we expect to see additional growth in the fourth quarter that's roughly in-line with the $970 million we saw this quarter.
However, as a reminder, on a full-year basis, we expect this increase to be partially offset by a roughly $500 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy asset wind-down portfolio in Corporate Other.
And we expect continued revenue growth in Asia and Mexico.Cost of credit should remain fairly stable, quarter-over-quarter and we remain on-track to achieve roughly 100 basis points of efficiency improvement this year.
And I guess, if we look out in that plan, is it fair that you expect that widening of the operating leverage to be partly driven by stronger revenues and partly by slower expense growth as we look out?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, John, I think we're consistent with what we laid out at Investor Day last year.
All of that is really what's going to fuel that revenue growth that you're going to see in 2019 and then beyond.John McDonald -- Bernstein -- AnalystThank you.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerAll right.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystHey, good morning, John.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerHi Jim.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystMaybe just following up on John's prior question on cards, as you noted, the net interest or the NIR percentage grew 23 bps to 8.51.
How do we think about that longer-term potential revenue yield in the card business?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I don't think that we're right in the position now, Jim, to give you a long-term goal on net interest percentage.
But again, constructively, when you look at what's going on in terms of AUM, we continue to build AUM and provided this isn't some long, prolonged period of extraordinarily heightened volatility, we'd expect those wealth management revenues to recover and therefore putting us on track for that 4%.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, you know, Glenn, we actually put a slide in the back of the earnings deck, Slide 20 just to sort of make some of the points that Mike is just making.
One is just on how the steepening of the yield curve is helping you out, and in particular, the European yield curve because I think there is a little more exposure there than most banks that I cover, so I wanted to get an understanding from you as to how it's impacting your forward look.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYou know, Betsy, we really are still much more exposed to movement on the short end on the curve.
Actual results, and capital, and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the Risk Factor Section of our 2017 Form 10K.With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you Susan, and good morning everyone.
Fixed income and equities were up 7% in total and, as in the past, our accrual businesses, TTS security services, corporate lending, and the private bank all showed strong year-over-year growth.Investment banking was down versus last year, as continued growth in M&A was more than offset by slower underwriting activity across the industry, but client dialogues remain solid and we feel good about the pipeline and upcoming transactions.During the quarter, we also made some changes to make certain our structure is completely aligned with our strategic goals.
His experience in Asia, where we operate a client-centric franchise with strong digital adoption, will help us bring North America to where it needs to be as we look to leverage both our brand and our scale and credit cards to drive deeper client relationships nationwide.In ICG, we're combining corporate and investment banking with capital markets origination.
Finally, in US retail, a drag from lower US mortgage revenues, which should abate going forward, as well as rising deposit sensitivity.Despite these headwinds, we've made good progress on expenses, bringing our year-to-date efficiency ratio down to 57.3%.
Average deposits declined 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by a reduction in money market balances, as clients put more money to work in investments.Assets under management grew 9% to $64 billion.
This underlying growth should accelerate and translate into reported growth in 2019, even considering the Hilton and vis-à-vis gains we took earlier this year.Finally, retail services of $1.7 billion grew 2%, driven by organic loan growth, as well as the full quarter benefit of the recent acquisition of the L.L.Bean card portfolio, partially offset by higher partner payments.Total expenses for North American consumer were up 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of investments versus the prior period.
On a sequential basis, expenses were roughly flat and should remain stable into the fourth quarter.Turning to credit, total credit costs were down 20% year-over-year, primarily due to a lower reserve bill in both branded cards and retail services relative to last year.
While investment product revenues are more market-sensitive and can be variable quarter-to-quarter, we've seen growth over time consistent with our growth in clients and assets under management and we are continuing to increase the proportion of more stable, accrual-type investment revenues as our business in Asia today is more sensitive to upfront transaction fees than in other regions.In total, operating expenses were up 4% in the third quarter, as investment spending and volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 4% as reported and 8% in constant dollars, reflecting continue growth in transaction volumes, loans, and deposits.Investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 8% from last year, as growth in M&A was more than offset by a decline in underwriting fees, reflecting lower market activity.
Corporate lending revenues of $563 million were up 11%, reflecting loan growth along with lower hedging costs.Total markets and securities services revenues of $4.5 billion were up 8%, excluding the gain last year.
Finally, in security services, revenues were up 11% as reported and 15% in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue.Total operating expenses of $5.2 billion increased 1% year-over-year as higher compensation costs, investments, and an increase in business volumes were partially offset by efficiency savings.
As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.8 billion this quarter grew roughly 5% from last year, as growth in core accrual, net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corp.
Are we getting to the point where the incremental savings will start being reflected in the core businesses as we look out?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYou'll see, as we said, consumer expenses staying stable next quarter.
So will you be getting additional disclosure as it relates to the North American consumer, whether it's digital banking or slice and dicing a few different ways for us externally.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerMike, when you say, ""Additional disclosure,"" do you mean other than the breakouts that we give you right now as far as branded cards, retail services, and retail bank and then adding them all up together to be the North America region?Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystOr it could relate to more digital banking disclosure, how you're doing with products and customers, or -- you have a lot more capability internally given what you've done with Project Rainbow.
Or would you be more open to maybe buying a branch network than you've been in the past?Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerI would say it's more likely than not to build organically.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay, and then if I could just squeeze in a completely separate question, the charge-offs in Latin America picked up a bit both quarterly and year-over-year, but the delinquencies actually went down.
Can you just talk us through if there was any notable change in underlying?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerNo, the pick-up in net credit losses in Latin America really stemmed from one commercial credit that we took to write-off this quarter, but we had already fully reserved for it.
Just wondered the thinking around that.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerThe way that the math works with some of the models, yes, there are some portfolios where, upon the adoption of CECL we'd actually have too much loan loss reserve.
",15.85,0.33926862
23,citicorp,q4,2018,"In addition, we grew loans and deposits in constant dollars by 4% and 7%, respectively, improved our return on assets to 93 basis points and managed our effective tax rate down to the 23% range, a little better than we had forecast.
And as a matter of fact, we've now had five straight years of consecutive growth in TTS and are confident that we can continue with that momentum.In Global Consumer Banking, in the U.S., we saw 4% underlying growth in branded cards and 6% revenue growth in retail services this quarter, and retail banking grew 5% ex mortgages.
As I mentioned before, we have levers we can pull if revenues come in lower, but we're very cognizant of the need to invest for the long term so that we can serve our clients with distinction.One thing before we go to Q&A.
And finally, cost of credit was $129 million this quarter, reflecting a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio.Looking at the full year, excluding the previously mentioned gain of roughly $580 million in 2017, both revenues and expenses grew by 3% in 2018.
And in equities, we made solid progress with revenues up 19% for the full year.The combined strong performance in these businesses help to offset weakness in Investment Banking and Fixed Income, down 7% and 6%, respectively, on a full-year basis.
We also recognize that we're in an uncertain macro environment where the market is beginning to discount future growth and this may create a more volatile operating environment as we saw in the fourth quarter, but we're continuing to manage the franchise responsibly and we're committed to steady, sustainable improvement in both our efficiency and returns.
And while our U.S. branded cards franchise generated only 1% growth for the full year, we saw 3% underlying growth in that franchise in 2018 with momentum as we exited the fourth quarter.That's a business with nearly $9 billion of annual revenues, where we are now realizing the benefits of our investments over the past 3 years.
Of course, it's more difficult to predict the operating environment in areas like trading and investment banking, but we continued to show good progress in M&A and equity this year, and our global FX business proved to be resilient in a challenging market.
And what we've shown here is that year over year for the past number of quarters, we've been able to bring that operating efficiency down.But more importantly to your question around expense ranges we can manage to, you can look at the fourth quarter of 2018 and see we ran at about $41.8 billion.
Or is -- I know that was sort of your prior expectations, is that still the expectation in '19 for the card losses?Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. What we've said, the medium-term expectations will be that branded cards would operate in that range of 3% to 3.25% and retail services in the 5% to 5.25%.
Is that kind of how you're thinking about branded card revenues for '19?Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerYes. I mean, if you -- the branded cards, as John mentioned, fourth quarter roughly 3% underlying.
We have the shutdown in the U.S. Just kind of any real-time updates in terms of macro traditions that you're seeing.Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. And I think the third piece is, that adds to that volatility, is things such as trade, kind of the on, off-again momentum of trade negotiations, obviously, affecting two of the biggest economies in the world.
And so again, when you think about things that are top of list, clearly, the more broad investment in terms of digital.We talked about some of those cost saves that have begun to come through, roughly the 200 this year, manifesting itself in 500 to 600 incremental in each of the next two years, a lot of that savings is dependent upon the continued investment in terms of the switch from analog to digital, and in particular in parts of our consumer business kind of coming from behind and kind of getting cards back on track, the empty calories of carding marketing investment in terms of our platforms there.
But if and when appropriate, we're going to pull the levers we need to pull.Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerMike, I'm not sure we mentioned TTS in particular as well in addition to those businesses.
The sort of tone at the top says, ""Hey, we've made a lot of progress, but we still have a long way to go."" We don't know we get that sense or I don't personally always get that sense, that this is a firm that needs to better optimize, notwithstanding how far you've come.Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerMike, I think you've got to go back and put in a little bit of context of history, right.
And then, Mark, what's the difference in your approach versus John in how you're going to look at things and maybe nuanced changes?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerMike, when you look at -- actually, the answer to both the question you asked to Mike and to me, when we look at the efficiency by business, most of the work still has to get done in the consumer business.
But that's -- it's in the overall efficiency in the consumer business where we still have some work to do.I'll turn it over to Mark.Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerYes. I guess I'd say, one, I'd like to just echo the point that we are intensely focused on this.
That involves what we can do to continue to realize the benefits and the momentum we're seeing in the strong parts of the franchise, many of which both Mike and John have gone through.It involves us delivering on the savings from productivity, the $500 million to $600 million that largely should offset the volume and compensation growth that we see in revenue growth going into '19.
And certainly, you conveyed a very positive tone on your ability to hit that 3% target.Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerYes. One, you're spot on in terms of NII, in that we feel like our ability to deliver on the $2 billion or so or similar performance to what we saw in 2018.
Obviously, as we go forward, we'll continue to refine that, but I think we're quite comfortable with the 11.5% today.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerI think the only thing I'd add to Mike's comment is that 11.5% that we laid out there, that was never intended to be a bright-line limit.
And maybe what's your expectation in terms of where that could bottom as a percentage of total deposits?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerI'm not going to give you the guidance as to where it could bottom.
So we think right now, we're in a fairly good balance, but we are still going to see a bit of a shift going forward from noninterest bearing into interest bearing.Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerJust keep in mind, our U.S. retail deposits are about $150 billion out of $1 trillion of total deposits we have.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystAll right.
So we think we're above that.And clearly, as we execute against the trajectory this year to 12%, obviously, clearly above that, and above 12%, 13%-plus and beyond.Marty Mosby -- Viking Sparks Management -- AnalystThanks.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Marty.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystHey, thanks.
We're already seeing that in the ICG.Just think about the net interest rate, the net interest revenue outlook that we just talked about and all of the growth now that is coming out of those businesses.
But at this point in time, I'd say that mix that we talked about then in terms of needing to close the gap on the consumer side and 100 basis points or so of improvement on the ICG side is still where we think things are heading.I guess the final point I'd make on that is, as you saw in the fourth quarter, where we see pressure in the business, i.e. And I know we'll get the VAR numbers in the 10-Q, 10-K, and so I assume we'll see some reflection of that there as well.
But I'm just wondering on the rate side and the volatility that existed in rates.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerRate -- when you take a look at the decline in FICC revenues, most of it was centered in G10 rates, so that was a big driver of the year-over-year decline in FICC.
And how dependent is hitting those 2020 targets on revenue growth alone?Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerSo when you look at that -- as we described it at Investor Day, Brian, we talked about a number of levers, right, that it was the combination of single-digit revenue growth, good expense discipline, reasonable cost of credit and obviously, significant capital return.
Because you give us the last 12 months, but it's hard to get a real sense of what the revenues actually were -- did year on year without the actual number for the quarter.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Vivek, I don't have that number in front of me.
And we've been pretty consistent with positive operating leverage coming out of Mexico in particular, and we would expect to have positive operating leverage in Mexico in 2019 as well.So it's a one quarter.Vivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- AnalystBut if I look at, John, full-year '18 and ex the gain on the sale of the asset management business, it was essentially revenue growth and expense for the -- given your rounded numbers in constant dollars, are essentially the same.
Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com; after which, we'll be happy to take questions.Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
We finished the year with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 11.9%, up from 11.7% in the third quarter as risk-weighted assets declined.We'll be making our CCAR submission in the spring and believe we've got that capacity to reach our three-year capital return target of $60 billion.
Now looking at our results on this basis, net income of $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter grew 14% from last year driven by a reduction on expenses, lower cost of credit and a lower effective tax rate, and EPS grew 26% including the impact of an 8% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.
Revenues of $17.1 billion declined 2% from the prior year, primarily reflecting lower Fixed Income Markets revenues as well as of the wind down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.
Excluding these items, consumer revenues grew 3% in constant dollars, slightly below our medium-term goal.This is primarily driven by the near-term impact of weaker market sentiment on our Asia wealth management revenues; the impact of partnership terms that came into effect in 2018 in U.S. branded cards, which we have now lapped as we go into 2019; and finally, in U.S. retail, a drag from lower U.S. mortgage revenues, which should abate going forward as well as rising deposit sensitivity.Institutional revenues also grew 3% as strength in our accrual businesses in Treasury and Trade Solutions, Securities Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank was partially offset by weakness in Fixed Income as well as softness in equity and debt underwriting.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 5% year over year in the fourth quarter, slightly better growth than we saw in the third quarter as deposit spreads stabilized in our commercial portfolio and we faced fewer headwinds from episodic transaction activity.Average deposits declined 1% year over year, primarily driven by the transfer of deposits into investments.
Average loans grew 3% versus last year, including 9% growth in interest-earning balances, as recent vintages continued to mature and we saw strong balance retention across our portfolio.This growth in percentage improved by over 30 basis points to nearly 880 basis points, a little better than we had anticipated for the fourth quarter.
As such, we expect to remain broadly around this level of spreads going forward, although we will see quarterly fluctuations and actual performance will depend on a number of factors, including our acquisition mix, the rate environment and our balance between proprietary and co-brand portfolios over time.
In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 5% or 7% excluding the ongoing impact of the sale of our asset management business in the third quarter.Card revenues grew 8% on continued strength in purchase sales and loan growth, while retail banking revenues grew 6%, excluding the impact of the asset management sale.
And excluding investment revenues, our underlying Asia consumer growth remains broadly in line with our medium-term expectations driven by growth in loans and deposits.Total average loan growth of 3% in Asia includes the impact of our continued repositioning away from lower-return mortgage assets.
In total, operating expenses were up 1% in the fourth quarter, as investment spending and volume-driven growth were largely offset by efficiency savings, and cost of credit declined 1% reflecting a modest reserve release in Latin America this quarter.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8.Revenues of $8.2 billion were down 1% in the fourth quarter, as strength in our accrual businesses as well as revenue growth in M&A and equity markets were more than offset by weakness in fixed income.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 7% as reported and 11% in constant dollars, reflecting continued growth in transaction volumes and deposits as well as improved spreads.
Investment banking revenues of $1.3 billion were down 1% from last year, as strong M&A performance was more than offset by a decline in underwriting, reflecting lower market activity.Private Bank revenues of $797 million grew 3% year over year, driven by growth in loans and investments as well as improved deposit spreads.
Fixed Income revenues of $1.9 billion declined 21% year over year due to a challenging trading environment during the quarter.At the Goldman conference in early December, I noted that while clients remained engaged, we did not see the level of transaction activity we had originally expected this quarter, in G10 rates in particular, as clients have largely stayed on the sidelines in an uncertain macro environment.
Equities revenues were up 18% mainly reflecting the impact of an episodic loss in the prior year.On an underlying basis, revenues were down slightly as strong client activity, particularly in derivatives, was offset by a challenging trading environment and lower client financing balances.
And in Fixed Income, if you look at our total G10 FX and local markets rates and currencies business, revenues were far more stable at roughly flat to last year as we benefited from steady corporate flow activity across our global network.Cost of credit was higher than the prior year given lower reserve releases, but credit quality remains solid with roughly 5 basis points of losses for the year.
Expenses were down 45%, also reflecting the wind down, as well as lower infrastructure costs.And pre-tax income was $44 million this quarter, better than our outlook, reflecting episodic gains in our investment portfolio as well as lower total expenses relative to our prior expectations.
As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.9 billion this quarter were roughly 8% for the last year in constant dollars, as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue as well as the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.Core accrual net interest revenue grew by $1.4 billion year over year, well above our prior expectations driven by the FDIC surcharge benefit, improved spreads in our U.S. branded cards business and balance sheet optimization as we deployed more cash into better yielding assets.
In the fourth quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 6% year over year to $63.79 driven by the lower share count and our CET1 capital ratio improved to 11.9% driven by a reduction in risk-weighted assets as we continued to prudently manage the balance sheet.
The largest of these is our Treasury and Trade Solutions franchise, which generated over $9 billion of revenues and posted its fifth consecutive year of growth in constant dollars.Our other accrual businesses in ITG across Securities Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank generated another $8 billion of revenues with good line of sight into 2019.
On the branded card, John, you mentioned feeling good about the momentum continuing on the NII front, which was very solid this quarter and better fees as you lap the partnership headwind.So what's a reasonable revenue growth aspiration for 2019 in this kind of economy?
I was wondering what your updated thoughts are there.Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerYes. That's still the target we're moving toward for branded cards and then now with tax reform.John McDonald -- Sanford C.
So kind of new tax rates maybe offsetting increased competition or stays about the same?Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerThere's probably a little bit of upside to that.John McDonald -- Sanford C.
And beyond that upfront impact, an acceleration of store closures would likely have an impact on the retail services revenues, perhaps resulting to -- in a flat top line result in total for '19 and '20 given the expected impact of new account acquisitions.Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd Glenn, just specific to your question, in there, again we've talked about it before, but you've got a co-brand card here where 70% of the volume on that card is out of store, which is consistent with top of wallet.
And that was one of the things that led us then to talk about trading revenues overall being down slightly year over year because we didn't see that good engagement in G10 rates.With December, we saw basically that extreme volatility, given the overall lack of a view of where rates would finally bottom out, just impact every one of our businesses in fixed income.
I just thought maybe there was a balance between the liquidity and the rates coming down, getting some deals done in the particular fourth quarter.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerOverall, Marty, debt underwriting, it may have been a little bit better than people were fearing, but it still was not exactly what I would call a strong environment by any stretch of the imagination.
But we're certainly not looking at any sort of significant ramp-up in cost of credit over the next couple of years, other than as loan portfolios continue to grow and season, you're going to get some natural increase.But those loss rates, we feel pretty good about those loss rates.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystAnd as you think about the segments and the geographies for hitting these targets into 2020 or maybe the long term, I call that, like beyond 2020, I guess.
I know we talked through Sears earlier.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. When you gave the updated guidance at the end of '18, you had said that 2020 was expected to be effectively lower than what it was in 2019, even though tax rate's down from 24% to less than 24%.

24,citicorp,q1,2019,"We had positive operating leverage and improved our efficiency for the 10th straight quarter, and we had strong growth in both loans and deposits in our core businesses.In our Global Consumer Bank, we had underlying revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region; excluding the Hilton gain last year, total revenues grew 4% on flat expenses and we grow our operating margin by 8% and credit costs remained broadly in line with our expectations, driving double-digit EBIT growth.In North America, we saw strong underlying growth of 5% in our Branded Cards portfolio and 3% growth in Retail Services.
We saw deposit growth in retail banking and introduced new products to our support branch-light, digital-heavy strategy in the US.In Mexico, we had 5% underlying growth and while Asia grew at a slower rate due to a very strong prior year investment revenues, loan and deposit growth remain solid.
While GDP growth does appear to be slowing somewhat, we still see good consumer and corporate engagement.We'll continue to focus on serving our clients and finding opportunities to deepen our relationships across our consumer and institutional businesses, and we remain committed executing our strategy and to meeting our financial targets.As you know, we pride ourselves on having a deep bench and last week we called on that depth when we selected new leadership who help drive our firm forward in light of Jamie Forese's retirement.
Revenues of $18.6 billion declined 2% from the prior year and were down 1% excluding the $150 million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio last year, primarily reflecting lower equity markets revenues and mark-to-market losses on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio, along with the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate Other.Expenses declined 3% year-over-year as continued investments in the franchise were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets, resulting in our 10th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage.
Excluding the previously mentioned gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses remained flat, resulting in positive operating leverage and an 8% improvement in operating margin, and pre-tax earnings grew 11%.Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail.
Excluding investment revenues, our underlying Asia consumer growth remains broadly in line with our medium-term expectations.In total, operating expenses were down 1% for the first quarter as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume-driven growth and cost of credit declined 4% reflecting a modest reserve release this quarter compared to a modest build in the prior year.Slide 7 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail.
Private Bank revenues of $880 million declined 3% versus a strong quarter in the prior year, reflecting lower managed investment revenues, as well as higher funding costs and corporate lending revenues of $569 million were up 9%, reflecting growth in volumes and spreads.Total Markets and Securities revenues of $4.7 billion declined 6% from last year.
Fixed income revenues of $3.5 billion grew 1% year-over-year as strength in rates and spread products was partially offset by weakness in FX given the low currency volatility seen this quarter while corporate client activity remained stable.
Equities revenues were down 24% versus a particularly strong quarter in the prior year, reflecting lower market volumes and client financing balances.And finally in Securities Services, revenues were flat on a reported basis, but up 5% in constant dollars driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue.
Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion declined 1% year-over-year as efficiency savings, more than offset investments and volume driven growth, and cost of credit was $21 million this quarter driven by portfolio growth partially offset by loan-specific reserve releases.Total non-accrual loans increased sequentially this quarter but the ratio of non-accrual to total corporate loans remained low at 41 basis points and the additions to non-accruals this quarter did not negatively impact our cost of credit, as these loans were covered by previously established reserves.Slide 9 shows the results for Corporate Other.
Thank you.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYou're welcome.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHi, thanks very much.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystSo I think both growth in the consumer side in Mexico and Asia are below where your goals were.
So you (Multiple Speakers)Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYou talk about (multiple speakers) which I think people have picked up on.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystYes, so there's a little bit on the revenue side and your building in a lot less normalization in terms of credit costs than maybe what most of us have.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerI kind of feel like we're looking at a normalized view of it.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystOkay, got it if I could change gears then on the Retail Banking earnings, income from continuing operations this quarter, I believe, was 80% -- in the $80 million something this quarter, far below what it -- far below what it's been in the recent past and I guess a couple of questions.
Understood thank you.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, good morning.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerHi, Betsy.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystI wanted to touch base on an announcement that you made at the end of March that had to do with Citi building out digital consumer payments platform and I know we talked earlier on the call about the issuer side, but I think this is more on the merchant side.
And then circling back up on CECL into your comments that you just made, do you guys think you'll give to us the investors by the end of the year some color on what the -- everyone has been very good in the day one reserve build which you just gave us or refine for us today, but any thoughts about what the day two the loan loss provision number could look like on a quarterly basis going forward versus what you're going to report in 2019 under the old methodology?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Thank you.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYour welcome.OperatorYour final question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC.Al Alevizakos -- HSBC -- AnalystHi, good morning.
Starting on Slide 3, net income of $4.7 billion in the first quarter grew 2% from last year, as a reduction in expenses and a lower tax rate more than offset lower revenues, as well as higher credit costs.
Since that time, we have optimized our mix of interest earning to non-interest earning balances while continuing to drive account growth, and we expect loan growth to revert to more recent levels starting in the second quarter.Finally, retail services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 3%, driven by organic loan growth as well as the impact of the L.L.Bean portfolio acquisition.
Importantly, we're managing expenses carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns as seen this quarter and our strong EBIT growth.Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the first quarter as growth in deposit, lending and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues.
And in Mexico, the NCL rate reflects continued seasoning in the cards portfolio, as well as the impact of lower overall volume growth.Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group, on Slide 8, revenues of $9.7 billion declined 2% in the first quarter as strength in TTS and Investment Banking was more than offset by weakness in equities, as well as the impact of $230 million of mark-to-market losses on loan hedges, as credit spreads tighten throughout the quarter.
In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.8 billion this quarter grew by roughly $860 million year-over-year, reflecting higher rates, loan growth and a favorable loan mix, as well as the absence of the FDIC surcharge.
And our NIM expanded by 1 basis point reflecting higher rates and improved loan mix.On a full year basis, we continue to expect to generate at least $2 billion of growth in net interest revenue year-over-year.
For the full year, we continue to expect modest revenue growth, flattish expenses and higher but manageable cost of credit combined with continued balance sheet and capital optimization to drive improved returns for our shareholders.Looking to the second quarter, we expect to return to year-over-year revenue growth.
I guess, is that 140 basis points more of what you're looking for this year in terms of efficiency better than you did last year and what are the key drivers of that?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So thank you, John, and good to talk to you.
Do you power through and grow the underlying franchise or do you cut back to manage profitability?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerI think that, Glenn, what we've talked about and I think what Mark pointed out in his remarks, is we've got the ability to manage the cost line there and to manage for both EBIT growth as well as returns.
And then when we think about your 2 billion plus for the year, well, I guess what scenario drives the pluses, is it just loan growth or is there some other aspects of the market that could help?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. I mean, it's largely going to be loan growth and the amount of volume we are able to capture there.
So we think that that will continue to play out, as I mentioned, we're seeing deposit growth there that's going to help on the revenue line and we expect that to continue as we execute against that strategy.
I don't think there's anything in particular in the way of expenses except what I would say is that for productivity that we've talked about is going to start -- it will continue to play out through the balance of the year and so that's going to help when you look at kind of the Retail Banking profitability in the outer quarters.
So combination of continued revenue growth, continued expense improvement on the heels of productivity saves should help drive improved performance there.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystWas there anything unusual in the line item this quarter, the $83 million of operating earnings, it's been running about $130 million to $160 million in recent quarters or is that just the tough quarter?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerNot that I can -- we talked about the investments that we've been making.
I mean those are the things that would be playing out through Q1 and again it is somewhat back loaded in terms of the productivity saves that start to play out in the balance of the year.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystOkay , got it.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerI guess the other thing I had mentioned is and I had mentioned this at a conference I did in March, which is that, as we came into the year and again on the heels of the fourth quarter where we saw material softness in revenue, we wanted to be very thoughtful about the 2019 plan and we did take an opportunity in Q1 to pull forward some of our restructuring decisions, if you will, reorganization decisions, and so while we don't break the item out, there's probably some repositioning dollars inside Q1 for retail banking in particular that is driving that $83 million that you see in the quarter.
So could you just talk through -- perhaps just more of a better aspiration on the revenue side of why you don't you expect flat year-over-year given the point you just made about having perhaps a little restructuring under there and then the better start already that you had in the first quarter of the year?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSo to be clear, we do expect to see revenue growth through the balance of the year and so that obviously will drive some expense dollars with that.
Thank you.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So our fixed income revenues grew 1% versus the prior year, and what we really saw was a normalization of rate in credit markets at the turn of the year coming out of the fourth quarter and the dislocation that was there.
",10.88,0.64269954
25,citicorp,q2,2019,"In the second quarter, while we saw pressure in underlying markets revenues, it was entirely offset by the Tradeweb gain, so non-interest revenues were flat to last year.Looking ahead to the second half of 2019, as a reminder, in Consumer, we will be comparing to the third quarter of 2018, when we had a $250 million gain on the sale of our Asset Management business in Mexico.
So just -- what are the things to think about, puts and takes for the second half that could get you over that 12% for the year?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, thank you.
The good news is that we have seen continued momentum in the Consumer franchise, particularly in branded cards as we've talked about over the past couple of quarters with very strong performance this quarter as well on the heels of us converting those promotional balances to more average interest earning balances, and we'd expect that revenue growth to continue through the balance of the year.You heard me mention the international franchises, which are growing to have continued growth in the balance of the year and where there is muted growth to have to offset that with expense management and therefore have EBIT growth, particularly in the case of Latin America.
And on the expense side, we talked to or I talked to really being on the high end of those productivity savings outweighing investments, and I would expect to certainly come in with that -- on the $600 million side of the range that we've talked to there.The big area where the uncertainty in the environment, you can pick the factor, whether it's the direct -- what's going on with rates and volatility around that or trade and tariff discussions, it plays out through the market-sensitive businesses.
It plays out through the trading that you see on fixed income and equities, it plays out through investment banking, it impacts corporate sentiment and those things, as you would imagine, are difficult to predict.We obviously feel good about the client dialog that we've had, but that's -- those are the factors that are a bit harder to manage.
Was there any frontloading of marketing or any other expense kind of frontloading or investment frontloading that happened...Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, I mean, when you look at the profitability, just in general, on the Consumer business, it does tend to skew toward the back half of the year because of things like marketing spend.
Are there offsets that we don't see and/or are some of those trends like the tail end of things that have been in motion and they actually get better over the next couple of quarters?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, so in terms of the net interest revenue, we're obviously at about $1.3 billion of net interest revenue with a strong Q1, about $450 million in Q2.
And as we look at that, we've obviously factored in, at this point, not only the shift that you've mentioned from non-interest bearing to interest bearing, but also the likelihood of a rate reduction based on the talk that is out there.And so as we look at it and we look at kind of the continued momentum on the card side and we look at the -- and the deposit growth that we're seeing, particularly in the TTS franchise with higher volumes, a growth of 10% or so, we feel pretty good about our ability to get to that 4% growth in NIR.
And then three, as we've been growing some of the US deposits that I mentioned earlier, some of that has been growth out of our markets, but with high -- so tide with high-yield saving account type product.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystSo would you expect that to continue to creep higher a little bit or start to stabilize?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerIt kind of depends on kind of what happens in the broader rate environment.
And the way we think about the return of capital or distribution of capital going forward is, largely as we get close to that 11.5%, which we expect to get close to toward the end of the year, will be around how much capital we generate, just opposed against how much we need to continue to grow.And so we certainly have the objective of continuing to return as much as makes good sense, given the growth opportunities for the franchise.
So we feel pretty good about that percentage albeit we started at a higher CET1 ratio years ago.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystAnd can you just remind us, as we think about the 11.5% target, what are some of the areas of clarity that you're looking for in terms of reevaluating that.
Like as you think about some of these moving pieces, do you think you'll have clarity before the next CCAR cycle that might motivate you to resubmit or is it more hoping to have clarity for the next cycle on these factors?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerIt's -- these things kind of take time to play out, I think as we've seen over the past couple of years.
But given that the $50 million impact from 25 -- per quarter from each 25 basis points to cut; presumably even if we do get one cut or two cuts, it seems like you're confident that you can get NII growth in the back end of the year versus the first half.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, I think the broader issue is the uncertainty that Mike and I have referenced, that's just out there.
Is there a reason why you're not doing that this time around?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. Just -- I mean, as we kind of exited Holdings and started to kind of wind down those legacy businesses, it became less of a significant variable as you look at these total revenues, it was probably 5% of the aggregate revenues in the first quarter, and so it just wasn't as -- it wasn't, on a constant dollar basis, just wasn't as meaningful, and so we move toward simplifying it with both the legacy break out as well as the trading NIR breakout.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystOkay.
In a tougher rate environment, can you right-size profitability or how much more difficult is it to right-size the profitability of your retail banking business, if the Fed continues to cut?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, I'd make -- I make two points.
We do see benefits from technology playing out in these -- in the expense line and in the productivity savings that I've referenced both in '19 and 2020 and likely beyond, and those things will help in getting us to the lower levels of operating efficiency that we've talked about achieving over time.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerMike, I think if you go to Page 21 in the deck, you can see we've put in there some different drivers and metrics.
We'll see how this year plays out, given all of the uncertainty referenced and will go into 2020 with the 13.5% remaining our target and with the -- with clarity on where we think we'll end up against it.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd Mike, the way I think about it simplistically is, we're going to do everything within our power to get to those numbers with the exception of two things.
Will there -- will we get conviction in terms of the trajectory of this lower rate environment and portfolios have to reposition, because I think today, they're not position where they need to be fully.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd again, to that point, just last week when there appear to be some signs of greater clarity on the move-in rates, the reduction in rates and the timing of that, the equity markets responded very, very favorably to that.
We have seen kind of broadly just good activity with our consumer retail clients, not just with the net deposits, but also retaining deposits as they shift into AUMs and so as clients start to make investments and so the flow levels have been very good, if you include both AUMs and the deposits.I would say we would expect continued growth in the deposits in the back half of the year.
Some of it is rate, yes, but it's a combination of all of those things and we expect continued growth.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystAnd then, I know you mentioned that the NIM came under a little bit of pressure as you had significant increase in deposit growth and the tie-in question here is, is there anything you need to see from these customers?
We are in front of that investment to stay competitive and we'll continue to do so.And I'll let Mike kind of comment on some of the other piece, as you mentioned.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerMark, I would just to -- going back to TTS for one second, Betsy, operating in a declining rate environment is nothing new.
Again we could very well see as Mike suggested, the market having to react to a rate reduction and certainty around the direction in a way that is favorable to trading businesses, but we've got to kind of wait and see how some of that plays out.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America -- AnalystOkay, thank you.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- AnalystYeah, morning.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerMorning.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- AnalystSo, a quick question on branded cards.
But do you think that you'll be able to offset some of the impact as you're able to pull those deposit rates back now?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerI mean, look, we've seen, we talked a little bit about -- earlier about the betas and how they vary from the corporate clients and commercial clients to the retail consumer client base and I think there are other important factors as rates start to move in a downward direction.
Your target that is.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, as Mike kind of alluded to earlier, there are couple of factors that are involved in the CET1 ratio just taking that part of the question first, and obviously, we've had a management buffer that is included there of about 100 basis points.
How does it look at the end of the second quarter relative to the end of the first quarter?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerI guess, again on investment banking, kind of as you saw in the numbers, we ended down 10%, but better than what I talked about at Morgan Stanley.
And so, we kind of go into the balance of the year, feeling good, again, about that dialog but also recognizing our all these factors that we talked about influences the corporate sentiment and willingness to take action.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd George, you know, when I think of it, it's -- in some ways, it's -- the pipelines are fine.
In Asia, higher deposit revenues and a recovery in investment revenues drove growth in the region.In our Institutional Clients Group, we delivered continued growth overall and our steadier transaction and accrual type business showing the strength of our global client network, while we saw a pressure in our market-sensitive businesses reflecting the broader industry, even in products like investment banking, where we continue to gain share.During the quarter, we received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve for our 2019 CCAR submission.
These buybacks have reduced our common shares outstanding by over 10% in the last year alone, and help drive our tangible book value per share up 10% over that same time period.Given the current environment and market conditions, we'll stay flexible with a focus on making steady progress toward our financial targets through client-led growth and research discipline, including balance sheet credit and expenses.
Excluding the gain EPS of $1.83 grew by 12%, mostly driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding as well as a lower tax rate.Revenues of $18.8 billion grew 2% from the prior year, reflecting the Tradeweb gain as well as solid results in consumer and overall growth in our accrual businesses in ICG.
However, this growth was partially offset by lower market-sensitive revenues in ICG, as well as mark-to-market losses on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio.Expenses declined 2% year-over-year as volume growth along with continued investments in the franchise were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, resulting in our 11th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage.And cost of credit increased, driven by volume growth and seasoning as well as a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio, while overall credit quality remained stable.
And deposits grew 5% with contribution from both our Consumer and Institutional franchises.Looking at results for the first half of 2019, we saw continued momentum in consumer as well as the accrual businesses in ICG, which helped to offset the headwinds of lower market-sensitive revenues along with the continued wind down of legacy assets.
Average loan growth improved to 2% this quarter as we saw a smaller drag from promotional balances in the prior year, and we expect loan growth to continue to improve as we go into the back half of the year.Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 1% driven by loan growth, partially offset by higher contractual partner payments.
But importantly, we are managing expenses carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns, as seen again this quarter in our strong EBIT growth year-over-year.Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 5% year-over-year in the second quarter or 3% excluding a one-time gain, mostly driven by higher deposit revenues as well as a recovery in investment revenues.
We continue to see strong growth in our underlying Wealth Management drivers in Asia with 10% growth in Citigold clients and 7% growth in net new money versus last year.In total, operating expenses were down 1% in the second quarter as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume-driven growth and cost of credit was down 3%, reflecting a smaller LRR build relative to the prior year.Slide 7 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail.
Credit continue to be favorable again this quarter with NCL and delinquency rates broadly stable across the regions.Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8, revenues of $9.7 billion were roughly flat in the second quarter and down 3% excluding the Tradeweb gain, as continued momentum in the accrual businesses was more than offset by lower market-sensitive revenues and the negative impact from mark-to-market losses on loan hedges, as credit spreads further tightened in the quarter.
And corporate lending revenues of $538 million were down 9%, reflecting lower spreads and higher hedging cost.Total markets and security services revenues of $4.7 billion were down 4% from last year, excluding the Tradeweb gain, as growth in security services was more than offset by the decline in our markets businesses where the environment has been challenging and Investor client activity has remained muted.
And security services revenues were up 3% on a reported basis and 7% in constant dollars, reflecting higher rates as well as higher client activity.Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion declined 2% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investments and volume driven growth.
Credit quality remained stable and total non-accrual loans declined both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.Looking at the first half of the year in ICG, our operating margin improved by 1% as solid contributions from our growing, higher returning network businesses, most notably TTS and security services, were largely offset by the decline in our market-sensitive businesses.We are focused on continuing to build upon the strength that we are seeing in our network businesses by making it easier for our large multinational clients to do more business around the world.
However, net interest margin declined 5 basis point sequentially as the benefit of higher revenues was more than offset by higher cash balances, reflecting strong deposit growth in the quarter.In the first half of 2019, our net interest revenue grew by 6% or roughly $1.3 billion year-over-year in constant dollars.
However, we should be able to more than offset this headwind with organic growth across the rest of our accrual and consumer businesses, and we should see a favorable comparison in markets revenues in the fourth quarter, even if investor client activity remains muted, similar to what we've seen so far this year.On Slide 11, we show our capital -- we show our key capital metrics.
For total Citigroup, expenses should decline sequentially and cost of credit should continue to grow modestly year-over-year, reflecting volume growth and continued normalization in ICG.With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.Questions and Answers:Operator[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystHi, good morning, Mark.
A large portion of the expected profitability expansion in North America Consumer comes from rightsizing the profitability in retail banking and you gave some positive commentary obviously and you feel pleased about the momentum in terms of deposit inflows, the digital strategies tapping your cards network or your cards clients.But you also have a lower rate environment and deposit spreads are likely going to come in and I think you didn't have any growth in revenues in retail banking.
And can you maybe just speak to some of the unique aspects of the business like trading -- trade finance that should drive some lower loss levels through the cycle, since that was actually pretty encouraging commentary from our point of view.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, I mean, again, when you think about our corporate lending book and the quality of our exposure, the multinational clients that we cover, the 83% of it being investment grade type exposure.
Can you help us understand, like does that mean that over time you have the chance to still take the tax rate lower as you look into '20 and as part of your plan for the RoTCE improvement?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerWe're constantly looking at it and trying to identify opportunities, looking at obviously where we book business and the client demands around that and where there are opportunities to do that.

26,citicorp,q3,2019,"Deposit momentum continued with a strong contribution from both traditional and digital channels as we leveraged our brand in scale and credit cards to drive deeper multi-product relationships with our clients.Internationally, EBIT was up 26%, excluding the gain on sale last year.
The backbone of our global network, Treasury and Trade Solutions had strong revenue growth of 7% in constant dollars, while the Private Bank grew as well.In addition to achieving stronger business performance, we remain focused on improving the returns we deliver to our shareholders through our capital plan.
Starting on Slide three, net income of $4.9 billion in the third quarter grew 6% from last year and EPS grew 20%, mostly driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding, as we've continued to buyback shares throughout the year consistent with our capital plan.Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 1% from the prior year and were up 2% excluding the roughly $250 million gain on the sale of our asset management business in Mexico last year, reflecting solid results across both our consumer and institutional businesses.
Expenses increased 1% year-over-year, as volume growth along with continued investments in the franchise were partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets.And cost of credit increased driven by volume growth in seasoning and consumer, while overall credit quality remained stable.
And looking at year-to-date results in Consumer, excluding both gains in 2018, we generated 4% revenue growth, while expenses were roughly flat, resulting in 9% growth in operating margin and 12% growth in pre-tax earnings.Slide six, shows the results for North America Consumer Banking in more detail.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were, down 2% year-over-year, as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and higher volume related expenses.Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by 9% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios.
Revenues of $9.5 billion were, up 3% in the third quarter, reflecting continued momentum in TTS and the Private Bank, combined with strong performance in Investment Banking and stability in Fixed Income Markets, partially offset by softness in Equity Markets and Corporate Lending.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were, up 6% as reported and 7% in constant dollars as we continue to see strong client engagement and solid growth in transaction volumes partially offset by spread compression.
We would expect the underlying business drivers to continue to perform well in TTS, given our unique global footprint and ability to deliver integrated solutions to our multinational clients, despite continued uncertainty around the macro environment.Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were, up 4% from last year, outperforming the market wallet, reflecting continued strength in debt underwriting and strong performance in M&A, particularly in EMEA.
Private Bank revenues of $867 million were, up 2%, driven by higher lending and deposit volumes, as well as increased investment activity with both new and existing clients, partially offset by spread compression.
Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion increased 4% year-over-year, as investments, volume-driven growth and higher compensation costs were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Looking at year-to-date results in ICG, our operating margin improved by 1% as solid results in TTS and strength in Investment Banking were offset by the decline in equity markets revenues.Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate Other.
As you can see year-to-date net interest revenue grew by 4% or roughly $1.3 billion year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by 5% growth ex-markets, reflecting strength in North America Branded Cards and TTS, as well as the absence of the FDIC surcharge.Looking at results for the quarter, net interest revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and declined by roughly $250 million sequentially, reflecting the impact of lower markets net interest revenue.
So it is starting to work, I think, I referenced earlier the growth in digital deposit sales and referenced that in fact a good portion of that is coming from card customers, who previously did not have a retail banking relationship with us.
But how are you guys going to think about as you go through your planning and what the target for kind of 2020 is your balance wanting to show improve in RoTCE versus what's it might be a more difficult environment?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.
Thanks.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystHi.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerHi, Mike.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystFirst, look you're growing revenues faster than expenses, this was the 12th quarter in a row, whether you didn't call it out that way.
Mark, I was hoping you could speak to some of the factors that pressured the markets for related NII specifically, as I think back over the last two to three years as rates were rising, higher funding cost were consistently highlighted as a drag on your liability sensitive trading book and with rates declining, we're really not seeing that benefit from lower funding costs on the way down.And I was hoping you could help us unpack what's happening on the trading side?
And then just bigger picture as you think about the need to add scale to the US retail franchise, whether it might make more sense to grow inorganically, and is that even a viable option, given your current size or the current share of industry liabilities that you currently retain?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerSure, I'm not on this call going to speak to specific names, but in the not too distant future, you will see us coming out and you know our portfolio of world-class partners in our co-brands and in our retail services business and we've been working with a number of them on new value propositions around those offerings.
Just the retail bank strategy and appetites maybe grow inorganically?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYou know, it depends -- your definition of inorganic and so again, if we continue to find as an example, portfolios of loans or cards or those types of things that we can acquire and fit from a client demography perspective, fit from a business line perspective and obviously are accretive to our returns wide open to it.
And as we think about 2020 should growth in Branded Cards revenue more reflect the sort of mid single-digit loan growth that you've been showing?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, we would expect that volume at that pace would be the major driver.
And so that's how we'll think about capital return going forward, but the CET1 target at this stage remains at the 11.6% levels.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystThanks a lot, Mark.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
And deposits grew 9% with contributions from both our consumer and institutional franchises.Looking at year-to-date results on Slide four, revenues were, up 3% on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of FX, as well as the roughly $150 million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio in the first quarter of 2018 and the previously mentioned gain on the asset management business in Mexico.
And so we're getting continued use of the card, top of while it used as evidenced by those purchase sales and the benefit of them now being interest earning balances for us.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd that should, that's been the case for the past number of quarters.
We'd expect that to continue to play out in the fourth quarter and continue to get some spread benefits, but likely going forward well into 2020, the benefits will continue to play out from a volume point of view, some volume growth will continue to be an important factor as well.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystAnd what you're doing on the promotional balances offers, I've just noted some long 21-months type offers out there, just don't know if that's a growing percentage of the book or just tweaking at the margin?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYou know, we've now -- we've kind of reached the mix -- our desired mix of promotional balances that we are looking to have in the portfolio.
What exactly are you doing to penetrate that, it sounds like it's starting to work?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. We are, as we think about investments we've made in technology and our ability to mine the data that we have of our customers, we're able to create value propositions that they're likely to respond to and open up a retail banking account with us.So for example, we know which of our card customers enjoy and prefer our thank you rewards programs in which of our card customers respond to many of the other programs that we offer from a rewards point of view.
And so our ability to mine that data to create value propositions around things that our clients are motivated to, has -- or motivated with has resulted in the growth that we're speaking to now.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think the other piece of that Glenn is, so far we have done that exclusively with our own proprietary products.
So I think we've got the ability to continue to expand on that.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystOkay, thanks so much.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you.OperatorYour next question is from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystHi, good morning guys.
And there are puts and takes there, in parts of the business, there'll be pressure from some of this uncertainty in parts of the business like markets, there could be some positives, as we see volatility persist.And so we really need to get through the budgeting process to both understand what we think that topline is likely to look like, understand what levers we have available to us to pull in order to continue to demonstrate progress and see what we might be able to do to narrow that gap and deliver on our targets.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think as Mark alluded to, John, the other thing that -- I've very much want to do is get the benefit of continuing to talk to our clients in terms of how they're thinking about things, not just, I think as you've probably heard more broadly this morning in terms of the US, but when you globally look at the consumer, consumer's in fine shape, we saw the IMF come out this morning and revised growth downward.
So there is the higher performance from a base compensation point of view, there's some strategic hires that we've made in parts of the franchise.And then lastly and you've alluded to it, but it certainly played out in this quarter, as well as we've seen pressure on some of the wallets and as we've thought about kind of the long-term or longer term business model and benefits from technology that will play out, we've made some capacity adjustments and those capacity adjustments obviously come with a cost and so that is part of the -- what you see in the quarter as well in that 4% increase.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystSo you feel that even in a lower growth, but on negative growth, lower growth environment, you can still get the operating leverage over the intermediate term?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerNo think, we -- look, I mean obviously and adjusting the capacity here, we're going to see some benefits of that play out in 2020.
Really strong growth on a period-end basis, particularly on ICG, is that sort of end of quarter balance sheet positioning by some of your clients and that's rolling off or do you think that's sort of some sustainable growth, and if so, what's driving that?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYou know, we actually -- you're right, we did see strong growth in deposits across the board in TTS specifically as well.
And what is the role of technology in helping you do so?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerI'll take the first part.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, OK.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSo look, you're right, we have reflected positive operating margin, we expect that to continue for the full-year of 2019.
And so when we came into the year, what we told you was we would be going at every lever and looking at all the things that we could do and I think this year we've done that, I think clearly technology, when you go back to Slide 23 and look at our consumer business and some of the drivers around contact -- look around contact rates, digital mobile engagement, e-statement penetration, all of those moving, I think very nicely in the right direction and those continue to give us not only cost benefits, but as and more importantly, service benefits in terms of the reactions to those.So I'm guessing Mike that given what's out there, the 2020 will continue to be a year where everything is on the table.
We're going to kind of look at the multitude of those levers and we're going to kind of go pull it those as we see fit, but at the same time, not sacrificing the investments that we need to make to either maintain or continue to attempt to build competitive advantages in the US and around the world.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerOne think I'd add to that is, so if you think about technology and its benefits and how they manifest themselves, one as it relates to the offerings that we're able to create for our clients, so our ability to create solutions around our client's problems.
And so we are committed to the 12% within the realm of what makes sense for our firm, and in particular for our shareholders over the intermediate to longer term and I think you've seen again in this quarter, we pull at every lever we need to get there, but we're trying to do it smart and you have my commitment, Mark's commitment, we're going to continue to do that to do everything we can to deliver that 12%.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerI completely agree with that.
And so, it's just kind of maybe thinking through some of the puts and takes of that?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, we haven't given any guidance on day two, as you said, obviously the composition of the balance of the portfolio in any given quarter is going to be an important factor in estimating what that impact will be.
Why the book is enacting a little bit more liability sensitive and should we see any funding benefit over time as the Fed it continues easing?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, so I think -- look, I think it's, if you turn to page -- that Page 11, kind of, highlighted the mix that the dynamic that you're referencing, and that I spoke to, which is that we're obviously seeing lower NII from our markets business that's completely -- that's being completely offset and markets non-NIR.
Our ability to be in the room on not just trade, but more broadly defined supply chain management and really what that means in terms of a lot of companies today that operate in kind of just-in-time inventory is critical and as examples you know what we've seen out of the China mix is trade routes with Vietnam and India being a couple of the beneficiaries of that, and I think our ability to move with our clients in terms of what that means, how is this pretty well positioned out there, and it's something we're obviously wanting to make sure we're in the room and as part of.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd I think we're uniquely positioned to be part of that dialog, just given the globality in our presence in -- over 98 countries etc, so...Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGreat, thank you.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
But as you referenced we've got truly a national cards franchise and depending whether you cut the line at our proprietary network or you go to some of our co-brand and retail partners, we're touching as many as 70 million consumers across the United States virtually in every state.And I think as Mark referenced in the numbers and some of the experimenting we've been doing on the deposit side, our ability to grow outside of footprint of the deposits brought in not just in the quarter, but really year-to-date, two-thirds of those brought in outside of those six markets, of those deposits that were brought in over 50% of those deposits were brought in by people who do not have the relationship, the depository relationship with the bank.
Thanks.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, our consumer deposits while we did good growth in volume there, we did see pressure from a spread point of view.

27,citicorp,q4,2019,"Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC -- filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2018 Form 10-K.With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Liz. Our earnings per share of $2.15 were over 30% higher than a year ago and the $8.04 for the full-year was over 20% above 2018.We finished the year with a return on tangible common equity of 12.1%, just ahead of our 12% target for the year, this is 120 basis points higher than our 2018 return on tangible common equity of 10.9%.In constant dollars, our 2019 underlying revenues increased by 4% in both Global Consumer Banking and our Institutional Clients Group, good revenue growth paired with disciplined expense management allowed us to deliver positive operating leverage even as we continue to make significant investments in the franchise.
We continued to gain share in Investment Banking and the Private Bank posted good revenue growth of 6%; Treasury and Trade Solutions continued to grow despite a lower rate environment as we work to ensure our global network remains indispensable to our multinational clients.We ended the year in a strong capital position with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.7% and we're on track to deliver our Investor Day commitment of returning more than $60 billion of capital to our shareholders over three CCAR cycles having returned over $22 billion in 2019 alone.Our dividend creates a very respectable yield for our common shareholders and we reduced our shares outstanding by 11% during the year.
Starting on Slide three, net income of $5 billion in the fourth quarter grew 18% from last year as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate.EPS grew 34% including the impact of a 10% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding as we've continued to buy back shares throughout the year consistent with our capital plan.Revenues of $18.4 billion, grew 7% from the prior year driven by higher non-interest revenue and reflecting continued solid results across consumer, as well as our accrual businesses in ICG along with a rebound in markets.
Expenses increased 6% year-over-year, reflecting higher compensation and volume related expenses along with continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, and cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning in consumer, as well as volume growth and a few episodic downgrades in ICG, while overall credit quality remained stable.Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12%, better than our outlook reflecting discrete tax items.
In constant dollars, end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $699 billion as 3% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind down of legacy assets and deposits grew 6% with contributions from both our consumer and institutional franchises.On Slide four, we show our full-year results.
And looking at full-year results in Consumer, excluding both gains in 2018, we also generated 4% revenue growth, while expenses were roughly flat resulting in 9% growth in operating margin and 13% growth in pre-tax earnings.Slide six shows the results for North America Consumer Banking in more detail.
Client engagement remained strong with purchase sales up 7% and average loan growth improved to 4%, while our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans expanded to 921 basis points this quarter.In Retail Banking, our deposit momentum continued to improve with average deposits up 7% with a strong contribution from both traditional and digital channels.
In total, operating expenses for International Consumer Banking increased 3% in the fourth quarter as investment spending and volume driven growth was partially offset by efficiency savings and cost of credit was down 6% driven primarily by Mexico.Slide eight shows Global Consumer Credit trends in more detail.
Total Banking revenues of $5.5 billion were up 3%; Treasury & Trade Solutions revenues of $2.6 billion were up 2% as reported and 3% in constant dollars as we drove strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits and transaction volumes, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates.
We continued to see robust underlying business drivers in TTS, reflecting growth with new clients, as well as the deepening of relationships with our existing clients, including 10% growth in average deposits, as well as double-digit growth in our cross-border payment flows this quarter.Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion, were up 6% from last year, outperforming the market wallet, reflecting strong performance in equity and debt underwriting particularly investment-grade underwriting as we leveraged our global capabilities to help clients optimize their funding needs.Private Bank revenues of $847 million, were up 6%, driven by higher lending and increased investment activity with both new and existing clients, partially offset by spread compression and Corporate Lending revenues of $732 million were roughly flat as growth in the commercial book was offset by lower volumes in the rest of the portfolio.Total markets and security services revenues of $3.9 billion, were up 28% from last year.
And finally in Securities Services, revenues were down 1% on a reported basis, but largely unchanged in constant dollars as higher volumes from new and existing clients were offset by lower spreads.Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion increased 8% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation-related expenses and legal costs.
And net interest margin increased by 7 basis points sequentially, also driven by the higher markets net interest revenue.And turning to non-interest revenue for total Citigroup, this quarter, we generated strong year-over-year growth in non-interest revenue of roughly $1.2 billion.
We drove 2% revenue growth with a balanced contribution from both our Consumer and Institutional businesses.On the expense side, we were able to hold expenses flat, while making significant investments in the franchise as productivity savings continued to meaningfully outpace our incremental investments, as well as offset volume related expenses.
And I guess I'm wondering does that include your expectation for what day two CECL impact is likely to be, and maybe you could speak a little bit to how you're thinking about CECL and what's your assumptions are for the reasonable supportable period of CECL from an economic input perspective?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSure, let me, kind of, break that in two pieces if I can.
We continued to attract digital deposits from both existing and new customers, bringing the total to $6 billion for the year.Better sentiment helped increase our Wealth Management revenues in Asia and our Cards business contributed to growth in Mexico.
And on a full-year basis credit cost of $563 million were consistent with what we would expect annually given the size, as well as the quality of our portfolio.For full-year 2019, our net income grew 3% on the combination of revenue growth, positive operating leverage, continued credit discipline and a lower tax rate.
Looking ahead for 2020, we would expect a quarterly pre-tax loss of roughly $250 million in Corporate/Other, as we continue to invest in infrastructure and controls and see some impact from lower rates, as well as a reduced level of gains.Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue split between our markets business and the contribution from the rest of the franchise excluding markets on the top of the slide.
In line with the high end of our latest outlook, mainly reflecting strength in North America branded cards and TTS.Looking at results for the quarter, we saw a rebound in markets net interest revenues, both year-over-year and sequentially, while growth in the rest of the franchise was more than offset by the headwinds of lower rates.
As Mike mentioned, the revenue environment has changed since we set our targets for 2020 with lower interest rates, slower global growth, and the pressure we've seen in industry wallets in markets and banking.In an environment similar to the one we are operating in today, we expect to deliver an RoTCE in the range of 12% to 13% for 2020.
So we expect we will continue to make progress in improving our returns and we look forward to having the opportunity to talk more about this year and beyond at our Investor Day in May.With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.Questions and Answers:Operator[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous.
Is that a pace you think you can keep up with the new initiatives on deposit growth?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSo we've seen good deposit growth as you said through the year in both our Consumer business, as well as on the Institutional side and that in many ways I think is an important proof point around our consumer strategy.
That said, we've delivered on the 1% we've talked about as guidance for the revenue growth for the quarter and I think it's 2% for the full-year.We would expect to see continued pressure from the Sears portion of the portfolio, particularly on the purchase sales and that said, it is still a very profitable portfolio for us.
And I'm just thinking as we try to unpack the walk to that 12% to 13% you spoke of, and the fact that you do have provision likely trending higher in 2020 and assuming no further benefit on the tax side, just help us think through what are some of the key drivers to help us get to that 12% to 13%?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSure, so look, I think it's -- if you think about what we saw this year and some of the key important drivers of performance, you can kind of look across many of the businesses and see good top line growth underlying and good EBIT performance.
But if we look at the second half of last year, the operating leverage, particularly in the Investment Bank has been minimal, it's been OK, but you had 7% -- as a firm you had 7% growth, top line growth with some investment gains, 6% expense growth in the fourth quarter.So I just wanted to understand, I think the upside -- the upper end of that range would imply some pretty good operating leverage.
Those were obviously increases in expenses in the year that will play out or damage or reflect or generate benefits in 2020 again creating capacity.And then you referenced the back half, and particularly if you look at the ICG in the last quarter, you got to kind of keep in mind that growth in expenses is 10%, top line growth is 8% expenses -- expense growth, but that comes with the compensation increase associated with those revenues.
The volume increases associated with that activity that we saw in the back half of the year and so you really got to think about the full-year expense base as we go into 2020 as the timing for both investments and the productivity benefits will vary through the course of the year and we'll get into much more of this and the forward look beyond 2020 obviously at Investor Day.OperatorThe next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
And we think we've got the ability using technology, client engagement, wallet share of gains, a lot of the leverage that we've spoken to on the revenue and expense side of continuing to make improvement and make progress against those benchmarks.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. We've made progress over the past couple of years when we talked last about our underlying performance, consumer and the ICG, we pointed to consumer as having the opportunity to close the gap between where we were two years ago and something we thought it was up in the 20% or so.
There a number of factors there that impact day two and we've consider that as we look at our 2020 forecast and as I've given you that range, it factors in that consideration.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystOkay, thanks.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerWelcome.OperatorThe next question is from Ken Houston with Jefferies.
Anything else just changing in terms of just flows that you see from the business outside of normal course, that's coming via the repo market, the Fed balance sheet expansion or is it just really was a seasonality?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerIt was seasonality and we obviously work to ensure that we were meeting client needs, while being able to deliver inside of that bucket, but nothing outside of that, nothing related to kind of the repo activity as you mentioned in the market.Ken Houston -- Jefferies -- AnalystOkay.
Thanks.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, so as I mentioned, we expect kind of total revenue growth in 2020 with a mix from both NIR and non-NIR.
What are some of the data points do you think we need to look at throughout the year where the revenue growth could come in stronger?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.
So I guess the question is as you look out to 2020, do you expect securities gains to continue, do you have any impact of one-time gains and also what are your assumption for outside of the US?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerVivek, I apologize.

The significant loan loss reserves we took also reflected the Day-2 impact of the new CECL accounting standard.In our Institutional Clients group, we had strong performance in our markets business, as we help clients navigate severe volatility.
Our investments in risk management and controls, while never complete, are also serving us well in the face of the severe economic downturn and large swings across markets, whether in equities, fixed income or commodities.We've tried to help keep our people financially healthy as well and reduced the stress they're facing.
These bills are larger given the significant impact this change in our economic outlook has on our estimated lifetime losses under the new CECL standard.Revenues of $20.7 billion grew 12% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher markets revenues and the benefit of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio.
Our effective tax rate was 19% for the first quarter, below our full year outlook, reflecting a small benefit associated with stock-based incentive compensation.The ultimate economic impact of this health crisis and our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters.
We're combining this financial strength with operational resiliency given investments in our people, operations and technology along with digital capabilities, which allow us to partner with and support our clients as we all manage through this crisis.Turning now to each business.
Total credit cost of $4.8 billion were up significantly from last year, including a reserve build of approximately $2.8 billion, primarily related to the impact of changes in our economic outlook.Slide 6 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail.
In addition, the enhancements we have made to our digital capabilities have prepared us to better respond and continue serving our customers as they manage through this crisis.Digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter at $1.6 billion.
These capabilities are allowing us to remain engaged with our clients, even as roughly 40% of our branches in the U.S. are now temporarily closed, driven by lower customer traffic, particularly in urban areas.Turning now to the businesses; branded cards revenue up $2.3 billion, grew 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% loan growth and continued spread expansion, with net interest revenue as a percentage of loans, improving to 933 basis points this quarter.
We also saw strong engagement with existing clients driving balanced growth across deposit products, including checking.While AUMs declined by 6% due to market movements, we drove continued growth in Citigold households and investment fees during the quarter.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were down 1% year-over-year, as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume-related costs.Turning to credit total credit cost of $3.9 billion increased significantly from last year.
However, given the rapidly changing economic environment due to COVID-19, we are likely to see increased pressure on NCL rates in the back half of 2020, consistent with the reserve actions we took this quarter.On slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
However, average deposit growth remained strong at 8% this quarter and we continue to drive digital engagement across the franchise.Today, we are seeing some early signs of a pick up in activity in China, as movement restrictions have eased over the past week or so.
However, I would note that investment grade debt underwriting was up double-digit year-over-year as we helped our clients source liquidity in this evolving environment.Private Bank revenues of $949 million grew 8% driven by increased capital markets activity as we supported our clients through turbulent market conditions and higher lending and deposit volumes partially offset lower deposit spreads, reflecting the impact of lower interest rate.
And the pre-tax loss was $535 million this quarter, higher than our previous outlook, reflecting loan loss reserves on our legacy portfolio, marks on security, the impact of lower rates, as well as the special compensation award.Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trend.
In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.5 billion this quarter declined slightly year-over-year as the impact of lower rates was mostly offset by loan growth and an extra day along with higher trading-related near.
Why don't I start Mike or...Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerSure, go ahead.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerLook, I think our view is, we are clearly living in uncertain period of time.
If that's a fair question?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. So I mean if you think about CECL and how it works in the idea of building expected lifetime losses in any given quarter.
But I'm curious if you have a perspective and whether you think the stress losses should be sort of a reference point for how useful they are to measure whether a given bank or your bank has adequate reserves?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerLook, I think you've said a lot there.
And including the $4.1 billion transition impact as we adopted CECL at the beginning of the year, as well as the additional reserves taken this quarter, credit reserves stand at roughly $23 billion with a reserve ratio of 2.9% on funded loans.With the level of capital, liquidity and the reserves we hold today, plus significant pre-provision earnings power, we are operating from a position of strength.
So in total, we grew purchase sales 3% in branded cards in the first quarter, but the trendline over the past month would indicate a significant decline in purchase activity in the second quarter, which is expected to impact loan growth.Retail Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were largely unchanged year-over-year, as a benefit of stronger deposit volumes, and an improvement in mortgage revenues were offset by lower deposit spreads.
We built roughly $2.4 billion in reserves this quarter, reflecting the impact of changes in our economic outlook and net credit losses grew by 8% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards' portfolio.
However, we continue to see pressure on overall loan growth, and while we haven't yet seen the full impact from COVID-19 in Mexico, we did see a slowdown in purchase sales in March, which is expected to continue, as customer behavior will likely follow the pattern we've seen in other region.
I would also note that we are taking appropriate actions to manage new and existing credit exposures, including investments in our operation, and importantly, as I've noted on prior calls, we feel good about the quality of our consumer credit portfolios, both relative to the industry, as well as Citi's historical risk exposures.If you look at our U.S. card portfolios, as an example, the FICO distributions of our outstanding loans and open-to-buy exposures, skew much more toward the higher end than before 2008 crisis.
That said, clearly, the impact of COVID-19 is not fully known at this point, and we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio.Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 9; revenues of $12.5 billion increased 25% in the first quarter, a strong performance in fixed income and equity markets, as well as the private bank, is partially offset by lower revenues in TPS and corporate lending.
Treasury and trade solution revenues of $2.4 billion were down 5% as reported, and 2% in constant dollars, as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rate.
Given the breadth of that relationship, we are playing a pivotal role in helping our clients navigate through these unprecedented time.We continue to see robust underlying business drivers in TPS, including 24% growth in end of period deposits in constant dollars, as well as 6% growth in cross-border flows, and we continue to see the benefit of our investment in technology given the accelerated adoption of digital tool.In March, while we, as well as most of our clients were working remotely, we opened close to 1,000 accounts digitally, three times the number we opened digitally in March of last year.
But as we exited the quarter, we did see the full pressure of the lower rate environment begin to take hold, with revenues down 9% year-over-year in the month of March on a reported basis.Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were largely unchanged from last year, outperforming the market wallet as growth in M&A and equity underwriting were offset by a decline in debt underwriting.
And while average loans were roughly flat, we did see a meaningful increase in end-of-period loans this quarter, reflecting the drawdowns and new facilities that I mentioned earlier, as we continue to support our clients.Total markets and security services revenues of $6.5 billion increased 37% from last year.
Equities revenues of $1.2 billion were up 39% versus last year, reflecting a strong performance in derivatives, including an increase in client activity due to higher volatility.And finally, in security services, revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and 5% in constant dollars, driven by higher client activity in deposit volume, partially offset by lower spread.
Overall, we feel good about our corporate credit quality, and like consumer, we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio and reserve levels relative to the stresses we see out there today.Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate/Other.
Revenues of $73 million declined significantly from last year, reflecting the wind-down of legacy asset, the impact of lower rates, as well as marks on legacy securities as spreads widened during the quarter.
As we look to the second quarter, we expect both net interest revenues and non-interest revenues to decline, reflecting the full quarter impact of lower rates, as well as a much more pronounced impact from COVID-19.On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics.
We remain disciplined in our target client strategy and feel strongly that our focus on these higher quality, more resilient segments is the right strategy in any economic environment.Looking to the second quarter and the rest of 2020, let me remind you that we are all operating with a great deal of uncertainty today, and our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters.
With that said, given the adverse impact of COVID-19, we no longer expect to deliver the RoTCE of 12% to 13% for the full year.Based on what we're seeing today, on the top-line, we expect the revenue trend in the latter part of March and the beginning of April characterized by COVID-related lower level of activity, particularly in banking and our consumer franchise will continue through much of the second quarter.
That should hopefully give you a sense of how we're thinking about the environment and our pre-provision earnings power.Turning to credit; looking ahead to the second quarter and the remainder of 2020, we do expect a higher level of losses given our current outlook.
What I'd point out is, you know the cards piece obviously is that roughly 9.5% excuse me, of LLR to loans, but again, we tend to -- to think of this as a higher quality book -- in terms of the factors that become important, there are a host of variables that we run through our model, as well as combined with a severity of a recession, probability of a recession.
And again as I suspect, as those things create challenges, it's likely that we will see a reaction come out of those bodies, to be able to address it.So I think the plumbing is actually working pretty well, that in spite of working remotely in the numbers that Mark and I spoke to, we had in late March record volumes of trading, in terms of settlement, clearing, margin, margining in the system and again, most of that done remotely and we all would have said to each other six, nine, 12 months ago we're going to model for this type of stress, we probably all would have been skeptical in terms of how the system performed.
And so I would expect -- we would expect there to be continued pressure on purchase sale volumes through most of the second quarter in light of the way this is persisting, and that should play out as well on ultimately loan volumes, in which we expect to see some top-line pressure there.Similarly, as you've referenced, we have a large retail services business and we have partner clients who we had advised in that regard and we've been working with them to help drive sales digitally.
That said, we've got a number of partners who do operate -- or large partners, I should say who do operate as essential resources to the economy, and while they will have lower store traffic, they will be able to continue to kind of serve and ultimately, as I said, we would expect the second quarter to have some of that top line pressure play through and over the course of the year to see a pick up in NCLs, subject to of course, how things like the $2 trillion relief package and some of the other customer relief offerings that we put out, take hold.Kenneth Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystYeah.
You saw us in very early March go -- I think as the first U.S. bank to go out and engage around, in particular, our consumer customers, in terms of opening up channels and talking about some forbearances and some forgiveness on fees and other things to get them engaged.

29,creditsuisse,q2,2019,"Let's look at our 2Q performance in more detail on the next slide, please.So, two quarters post our restructuring, we believe that the operating leverage which we created in those three years is starting to bear fruit.
In Wealth Management, our revenues have remained resilient in difficult markets reflecting the strength of our diversified franchise and the effectiveness of our ultra-high net worth focus.
We have been able to build on our strong first-quarter inflows in light blue here and generated 9.5 billion CHF of net new asset in the second quarter in dark blue here.
Let's look now at how this has translated more importantly not only in earning but also in pre-tax income on the next slide.Over the last three years, we have grown our Wealth Management related pre-tax income at a CAGR of 15% achieving a pre-tax income of 2.6 billion CHF in the first half of 19.
Moving on to IWM, we delivered a resilient performance with strong net new asset inflows across both private banking and asset management delivering a return on capital of 29% at the bottom here of the page.
This is the first time since 2015 that we do so and roughly 2/3 of those are focused on emerging markets to accelerate our growth going forward and this may explain to some of you why the costs in IWM were up year on year, 70 RMs hired.In APAC we had a strong quarter with revenues up 9% both year on year and sequentially for Wealth Management and Collective.
You can see that the benefits of these actions are starting to come through in our Q1 performance and even more so in our 2Q performance on the next slide.Looking at the second quarter, we have been able to grow revenues in both equities and fixed income and sales and trading and outperforming the Street and gaining market share.
I would now like to take you through our financial results in more detail.For the second quarter, Credit Suisse had net revenues of 5.6 billion CHF broadly flat against the same quarter of last year.
This lead to a 30% reduction in revenues.If we turn to costs, as we said before, we remain committed to delivering year on year productivity increases across our businesses and our operations, with the pace of reinvestment depending on the market and economic environment.
Including the benefit of the reduction in the tax rate, net income attributable to shareholders stood at 937 million CHF in the second quarter, up by 45% year on year.
Again, well above our target level which as you know is to exceed 5%.Looking at risk-weighted assets, they increased by 1 billion CHF to 291 billion CHF at the end of the second quarter.
The Swiss Universal Bank generated 1.48 billion CHF of revenue, up by 4% year on year including the gain from the real estate in the quarter that Tidjane referred to.
Included in the Swiss real estate game, that resulted in a pre-tax profit of 654 million CHF for the second quarter of 2019, equivalent to a return on regulatory capital of 20%.
We saw a further good performance in terms of net new asset accretion in both our private clients and our corporate institutional client businesses across the first half of the year.
That's lifted CNIC assets under management to 411 billion CHF up by 15% year on year at the end of the second quarter.Let's turn to slide 32 to look at International Wealth Management.
Our IWM division delivered a robust second quarter with revenues of 1.37 billion CHF an increase of 2% year on year and a 3% increase in pre-tax income to 444 million CHF.
The quarter also saw a record NNA level in IWM's private banking segment with 5.5 billion CHF of net inflows in the second quarter.
If we look at Wealth Management in connected, we saw a continued strong performance across our main businesses, private banking advisory, underwriting, and financing.
Overall, we made a pre-tax profit of 216 million CHF in WMC, an increase of 29% compared to the same quarter of last year.In private banking, we saw net new assets of 2.8 billion CHF in the second quarter following on from the 5.0 billion CHF that we received in the first quarter to take the total to 7.8 billion CHF for the first half of the year.
However, combined with a cumulative benefit of the cost measures that we undertook during the quarter of 2018, we reduced total operating expenses year on year by 7% in our Markets operations leading to a pre-tax income of $21 million for the quarter.Let's turn please to slide 34 and the Investment Banking and Capital Markets division.
As you've already seen, fees across the Street fell by 23% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter of last year and our advisory business was impacted by a reduction in the number of transactions that we closed in the period.
We reduced expenses by 15% year on year to $447 million and this combined with the increase in revenues quarter on quarter resulted in a return to profit in the second quarter.Finally, let us conclude, please, with Global Markets.
We saw good momentum across all of our business, which combined with continued discipline in terms of expense and capital resource usage as well as the benefit of the reduction in funding costs that we talked about last year.
We've remained very disciplined with the deployment of capital to the GM business with RWA and leverage uses similar to the level seen in the second quarter of 2018 and that resulted in a return on registered capital of 11% for the quarter and as Tidjane has mentioned 17% in terms of the return on risk-weighted assets.With that, I would like to hand back to Tidjane to close the presentation, please.Tidjane Thiam-Chief Executive OfficerThank you, David.
Navigating through these markets requires our teams to stay close to our clients executing on transactions when windows of opportunity present themselves.On the next slide, in the environment we just described, we have continued in Q2 to grow group net income, as you can see here, reaching 937 million CHF in the second quarter.
And this takes our bottom line close to a billion CHF for the quarter with a 45% year on year increase and it is our highest quarterly net income since 2Q 15 four years ago.On the next slide, you remember that at our 2018 Investor day we outlined a path to drive our returns higher even in a challenging revenue environment.
So, I think a lot of the things we're doing ourselves, as Tidjane has referred to already, will actually benefit us.Tidjane Thiam-Chief Executive OfficerThen you asked what's the role of ITS in the equities progress.
And I say in my remarks, I believe our PTI at 164 million CHF in our Private Bank is the highest in Asia in absolute terms this quarter, although some players are much bigger than we are.
I think that's the most I can tell you at this point in time.Daniele Brupbacher -- UBS -- AnalystYes. No, that's good.Tidjane Thiam-Chief Executive OfficerYes. I would merely say that we will exceed both of those numbers, both in total and for the Global Markets division.
I think it is noteworthy that the RM count was up by 70 net in terms of those numbers, but do keep it in the context on page 45, please.Tidjane Thiam-Chief Executive OfficerYes. But it will remain a high return on capital business, which is really how we drive the business.
We achieved this during the second quarter when markets remained challenging as we will see on the next slide, please.So, while equity market on the left in green here has performed strongly in the first half of 19 and are at or near all-time highs globally, credit spreads on the right remain at elevated levels compared to the same period in 2018 even if they started decreasing in June.
We believe that the sustained reduction in fixed costs that we have achieved lowering crucially our breakeven point and our continued focus on productivity improvements leave us well-positioned to benefit from improving market conditions with any uptick in revenues dropping directly to our bottom line.So, let's move to the operating performance of our businesses in more detail and I'll start with general comments about our Wealth Management franchise and performance.
Our broad range of capabilities gives us various options to generate client revenues which have proven very valuable in challenging markets as we have seen in Q1 and Q2.Let's look now at our asset flows on the next slide.
To put this performance into perspective, we have added organically the equivalent of a mid-sized asset manager or private bank for asset inflows alone.Let's look now at the development of our Wealth Management net revenues on the next slide, please.
As you see on the right here, we believe that we can more or less double the revenues with an ultra-high net worth client that are pure pay Wealth Manager would generate in dark green here.
This slide illustrates the interest of our integrated one-stop-shop approach with a case of a leading Asian ultra-high net worth entrepreneur client whom I've met many times and who has become increasingly active with us as his business has grown exponentially over the past years.
We also added in 1H 19, and this is important, 70 experienced RMs. We saw higher revenue growth across all of our three business, Private Banking, IBCM, and Financing, with APAC private banking delivering its second-highest revenue quarter ever.
In APAC IBCM we achieved the 11th consecutive quarter with revenues above 200 million CHF and we were ranked number one in advisory and underwriting for APAC ex-Japan as well as for the first time ever number one in the share of wealth for greater China.
Finally, ATS, the newly created ATS, APAC Trading Solutions, our regional setup to deliver asset and liability solutions for our ultra-high net worth clients is off to a good start with already five deals in the quarter and a high level of client engagement across the region.You can see here, we have generated strong results across all our Wealth Management businesses in 2Q and as you can see on the next slide we believe there are significant further growth opportunities.
So, on the next slide having defined a clear strategy of being the leading Wealth Manager with strong investment banking capabilities, we believe that having a strong Global Markets business was key.
We are reestablishing our historic electric trading relationships and adding new prime mandates.Moving on to Fixed Income Sales and Trading revenues were up by 11% in 2Q with a strong performance from our leading products which benefited from lowest rates and credit franchises.
We achieved a PTI of $359 million in 2Q which represents our best quarterly performance since 2Q 15 when we had more capital and a different risk profile.We said that post-restructuring the return to Global Market would increase and they have as is presented on the next slide.
We are gaining market share in key products and we are driving returns higher.To wrap up here, I wanted to pause to congratulate our teams across the globe and highlight some of the recognition they received for our client-focused integrated approach.
Our Wealth Management related revenues increased by 4% compared to the second quarter of 2018 a reflection of strength across all three divisions.
Revenues in our Markets activities rose by 3% year on year while our IBCM division continued to suffer both from the reduced industrywide levels of primary issuance and from the bias in M&A closings toward the final quarter of the year.
That includes an increase of 8 billion CHF primarily in our Wealth Management related divisions, offset by 12 billion CHF of currency moves.Let's turn to cost, please, on slide 30.
In terms of underlying business trends compared to the second quarter of last year, we saw some improvement in transaction revenues offset by weaker recurring revenues as well as some pressure on net interest income.
Operating expense was reduced by 2% to 812 million CHF with a cost-income ratio of 55%.Let me turn now to net new assets.
Whilst we remain very focused on continuing to increase the productivity of relationship managers both in terms of revenues and assets under management, I would note that since the fourth quarter of 2018 we've expanded by a net of 70 relationship managers.
I'd also remind you that in the first quarter of 2019, IWM's operating expenses were reduced in part by the release of certain litigation provisions.Private banking revenues were stable reflecting continued robust client activity and a higher dividend from SIX offset by a lower net in interest income and recurring fees as we saw clients move away from alternative assets to more risk-averse products such as fixed-income similar to the trends that we saw in the Swiss Universal Bank.
The 5.5 billion CHF of NNA equates to an annualized growth rate of 6% largely from ultra-high net worth clients with solid inflows in both emerging markets and in Europe.Now, turning to asset management we saw strong net new asset inflows of 8.6 billion CHF across both traditional and alternative investments.
Net revenues in our Asia Pacific division were broadly stable at 913 million CHF in the second quarter while pre-tax income increased by 9% to 237 million CHF.
That leaves us with total assets under management of 219 billion CHF for the Asia Pacific region.Our Markets business continued to be adversely affected by the weakness in trading volumes across the Asian markets.
I'd return to what we said last quarter, our investment bankers remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook and we continue to have a significant pipeline of deals to close albeit it is likely that the revenue recognition from these deals will be weighted toward the end of the year.Clearly, given these market conditions, IBCM remained very focused on cost discipline.
That means that total pre-tax income for the first half of 2019 for GM came to $642 million.Looking first at fixed income, we saw trading revenues in GM up by 11% which compares to an average decline of 7% in US dollar terms so far posted to the close of last night by American and European peers.
It was a good performance credit overall but particularly for our securitized product operations where we continue to see further opportunities to grow this business.
Like our peers, we did see lower revenues in equity derivatives but this was offset by an improved return on assets in our prime business and by market share gains elsewhere.Turning to costs, we continue to see the benefits from our past restructuring measures with total operating expenses falling by 7% year on year to $1.2 billion for the quarter.
This was based on executing against a number of known actions and we had said that we expected that we could achieve 10% return on tangible equity in a flat revenue environment because we didn't want to embed any strong revenue assumptions in our assessment.
We expect market sentiment to continue to be impacted by geopolitical uncertainty and punctuated by periods of lower client activity that will not surprise anybody.Finally, before we take your questions, Adam Gishen has asked me to make one more announcement.
Sorry, the same numbers if I may just in terms of ultra net new money and in cash wealth management.Tidjane Thiam-Chief Executive OfficerIt varies from one quarter to another, but yeah.
That's why we keep talking about it because it's really core to the strategy and the performance and that's also where our emphasis on trading capability, execution platform, Global Market, IBCM, really makes sense because for all the ultras it's extremely important.David Mathers-Chief Financial OfficerAnd cash balances in Asia was 26%.
I think what we said last year is that the restructuring measures we took, together with the runoff of certain positions within the SRU would reduce our group's funding cost by at least $700 million, of which at least $300 million would actually be in the Global Markets division.I'm not really going to add to that now.
David, do you want to take the gross margin?David Mathers-Chief Financial OfficerYes. I think, Andrew, I mentioned it actually in my comments that we had an 87 million CHF real estate gain in Switzerland here in the second quarter.
And it's had its 10th consecutive quarter of year on year revenue growth driven by strong new issue volumes.And finally, the kind of fixed income, linked to wealth management also did OK despite a very high comparative in 2Q 18.
Is it now more sort of net increases in cost as you make investments with attractive returns?Tidjane Thiam-Chief Executive OfficerYes. No.
",39.23,0.6540229000000001
30,creditsuisse,q3,2019,"Credit spreads, on the right, have remained at somewhat elevated levels, while we saw continued lower activity levels in ECM, Equity Capital Markets, and leveraged finance, products where we have historically enjoyed a leading market position.In 3Q, going into some of the geographies, we have seen a slowdown in Asia primary and M&A activity, primarily in Greater China with one of the lowest-activity quarters in the last five years in terms of market fee pool.
This combined with the strength of our private client and Private Banking franchise, brought our total divisional nine-month NNA to a record level of CHF47 billion this year.So after SUB, let's move now to International Wealth Management, where we had a good quarter.
Our Asset Management franchise is one of the highest-returning businesses at Credit Suisse, with a return on regulatory capital of 33%.So let's look now at APAC Wealth Management & Connected on the next slide.
So overall, it's the highest PTI quarter ever for our private bank in Asia.In addition, looking at IBCM, we hold the Number 1 market share in APAC underwriting and advisory this year at October 15.
Looking forward, our IBCM teams believe that their improved pipeline will lead over time to an improvement in our performance versus The Street.Next comes a slide that we've used a few times with you, at the 2018 Investor Day, moving on to Global Markets, we presented a path to improving our returns in Global Markets and identified a number of revenue initiatives to achieve this, as we felt that a priority after the deep restructuring was to grow revenue: increasing collaboration with wealth management through ITS, benefiting from a reinvigorated Equities platform and lower funding cost, which is a big benefit because GM has no natural funding and we carried for a number of years very expensive funding, of which GM was the main -- was carrying the weight of, if you wish.
So GM has been able to generate this performance without taking more risk in absolute terms and by making also the capital work harder, they have significantly increased in particular capital velocity, which has been a big area of focus, with very good results.So looking at our aggregated Investment Banking footprint.
As you know, we do provide more segmental disclosure on our individual Investment Banking businesses compared to our peers before -- because we think that that is the right management structure to manage a business well, as some of these results show, but in order to assess the overall progress that we have achieved across the franchise, it is helpful to look at the aggregate global IB performance beyond the existing divisions.
Significantly lower funding costs and the completion of the restructuring provide a continued tailwind for our global IB franchise going forward.So before I hand over to David, I'd just like to summarize our performance this quarter on the next slide.
We've now completed this change and realigned our capital hedging strategy, which leads to a higher proportion of our capital being held in US dollars rather than in Swiss francs.Given the spread that exists in the interest rate curve between US dollars and Swiss francs, that is expected to lead to an initial gain of approximately CHF60 million of additional net interest income in the fourth quarter of the current year.
Just looking forward, I'd also remind you that we expect this NII benefit to continue into the future, with an estimated 50 basis point contribution to the return on tangible equity in 2020.Let's turn to costs, please, on Slide 33.
Throughout this period, we've continued to fund strategic investments for growth across the bank as well as further investments intended to improve front-to-back digitalization efforts and to boost our overall productivity.Let me turn to tangible book value per share please on Slide 34.
Whilst the interest rate environment remains challenging here in Switzerland, I'm pleased to say that our transaction activities, although seasonally lower than the second quarter, shows an improvement on last year's level, while recurring revenues were stable.
In September, in common with certain other Swiss banks, we informed our Private Banking and our corporate clients with deposits greater than CHF2 million that they would start to incur a negative interest rate as a result of the continued negative rate environment in our home country.We believe this is the appropriate balance in terms of continuing to shield our retail customers here in Switzerland from negative interest rates while also protecting the overall profitability of our franchise for shareholders.We saw substantial pension fund inflows into our corporate and institutional client business totaling CHF6.3 billion of net new assets in the third quarter, and these inflows lifted C&IC assets under management to CHF425 billion by the end of the third quarter.With that, let's turn to Slide 36 please, to look at IWM.
Private Banking delivered net new assets of CHF3.6 billion, while Asset Management CHF5.9 billion.Overall operating expenses increased by 4% to CHF908 million, including the cost of the increased number of relationship managers who we've hired during the year.
However, advisory, underwriting and financing revenues for Asia Pacific fell by 18% year-on-year, reflecting the significantly lower M&A and equity underwriting activities across the industry in APAC.And I'd also note that the WM&C business saw an increase in credit provisions to CHF20 million in the quarter, including a final provision relating to the default last year of an Indian infrastructure company.
However, our Markets business in Asia Pacific continued to be adversely impacted by the weakness in trading volumes across Asia and by difficult conditions generally.On a US dollar basis, equity sales and trading revenues fell by 11% year-on-year, approximately in line with our understanding of market performance, but our fixed income business saw a much sharper fall in revenues to only $17 million in the quarter.
Our fixed income business saw a very strong performance across the credit franchise, with revenues increasing by 43%.
I think the balance sheet has sort of stabilized there, so I'm not sure if you can do more there or I know you're looking for more progress on cross-selling derivatives into wealth there, but I'm just wondering if you can help us quantify what difference that can really make and kind of what the blue sky scenario can really be for the APAC markets.And then secondly, in IWM, have you got more hiring planned there?
David, I think you highlighted [Technical Issues] of deposits to which Credit Suisse now applies negative --Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerSorry, Jernej, we lost you for 10 seconds, so can you just go back to the question on Slide 35, please?
Wealth management Asia, can we talk a little bit about environment in terms of cash holding, deleveraging process and also investor appetite and -- for taking risk and transacting with you both on the lending side as well as on -- clearly on the transaction side on the traditional business?And then secondly, on the Investment Bank, you clearly make a very strong point here of Investment Banking improvement and particularly in fixed income business, but the ROE is still below 10% if I would add the Global Markets business on top -- sorry, the Investment Banking business that's loss making, Asia loss making.
That's where you've seen a decrease of something like 39% but not on the PB side.Kian Abouhossein -- JPMorgan -- AnalystThank you very much.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd maybe just one final one, just reflecting on a discussion we just had on the environment.
So, what I said on the 2nd is that our total expected increase in net interest income across both wealth management and the Markets businesses for 2020 would be approximately CHF350 million compared to 2018.
Maybe it's a question for December.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerAs I said, I mean, we'll come back December, but the numbers haven't actually changed versus since we spoke last December, so...Jeremy Sigee -- Exane -- AnalystAll right.
And then, secondly, maybe you can elaborate on the initial discussions, I know it's early days, of your relationship managers with clients that are being charged negative rates; and more broadly, with less-attractive cash holdings globally, how these discussions are going to moving into higher-margin product for you?
I mean there's no question that we are cautious, and we need to see then, by the time we come to Investor Day, what it means more precisely for 2020.Anke Reingen -- Royal Bank of Canada -- AnalystThank you very much.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerOkay.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerI think one point I would -- I'm sorry.
For a detailed discussion of our results, we refer you to the Credit Suisse third quarter 2019 financial report.With that, I will now hand over to Tidjane, who will run through the numbers.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Adam, and good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining our call.
We believe that our 2019 results year-to-date support this assertion notwithstanding the fact that Q3 is, for us, typically a seasonally weak quarter.So in Q3, we generated pre-tax income of CHF1.1 billion, up 70%, 70%, and net income of CHF881 million, up 108% year-on-year, leading us to a return on tangible equity, an RoTE of 9%, double the RoTE of the same quarter one year ago which was 4.5%.We have been able to grow our tangible book value, and we have continued our share buyback program, leading to an increase in tangible book value per share, and more on that later.
But first, let's look at the context in which we operated during the third quarter on the next slide.The interest rate environment, on the left here, has continued to be a headwind for some of our clients and has weighed, on the one hand, negatively on market sentiment and investment decisions while being, on the other hand, supportive of debt refinancing and debt issuance.
We have delivered our twelfth consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage in the challenging environment of the third quarter, with revenue up 2%, on the left here, and costs down 1% year-on-year.So moving now to net income on the next slide.
The cost of the SRU wind down, the restructuring charges, legacy fines and litigation expenses as well as capital raises, which were both key and indispensable elements of the restructuring, had led to a significant reduction in tangible book value between 2015 and 2018, and that was the strategy.Since the start of '19, though, we have been able to achieve a material increase in profit, and therefore, in the first nine months of this year, we have been able to increase our tangible book value, the absolute tangible book value, by CHF1.2 billion, and to grow our tangible book value per share at a 9% CAGR, taking it above CHF16.
In nine months '19, we have attracted net new assets of CHF72 billion across wealth and asset management, an increase of 28% compared to the same period last year.Looking at our individual wealth management focused businesses, which is SUB private client, IWM private bank and APAC private bank, we have grown assets respectively as you see on the right here at nine months at 3%, 4% and 7% rate, a strong performance for a player of our scale.
We feel that, although there is often an understandable focus on our ability to save costs, we have also delivered on our growth agenda for those activities that we choose to grow.So on the next slide, we're giving you some insights on the components of our wealth management revenue.
David will talk about this in more detail, but we have continued our prudent approach to loan growth and we have also taken measures to protect our deposit margin through repricing.A particular bright spot for us was our transaction-based revenues, up 19%, 19 -- 19% in APAC private bank and 16% in IWM and about 12% year-on-year in total, particularly driven by the continued strength in ITS.
So overall, on the right here, we have increased our wealth management revenue by 3% year-on-year in a challenging quarter.So let's now turn to our divisions, starting with SUB, the Swiss Universal Bank.
And I want to salute here our IWM teams; and Philipp Wehle, for his first quarter as CEO of IWM, and who produced very good results.We have also performed strongly in our Asset Management franchise, as we can see on the next slide, which we want to give more emphasis to this time in these results because it's -- maybe a part of the business we haven't talked enough about in the past.
So yes, we have -- the revenues have gone down but much less so than the market, and we actually gained share of wallet.So now let's talk about wealth management.
In prime, we have been able to continue to improve our return on asset, and that's the third consecutive quarter where we do so.Simply put, we are generating more revenues in Global Markets with less balance sheet, and we believe that we continue to gain market share and increase our share of wallet without mobilizing more capital.
We have grown tangible book value per share at a 9% CAGR since 2018 and we have returned CHF1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first nine months of the year.And with that, I will now hand over to David.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tidjane.
Good morning, everybody, and I'd now like to take you through our financial results in some more detail.So for the third quarter, Credit Suisse had net revenues of CHF5.3 billion, an increase of 9% compared to the same quarter of last year, that includes the initial benefit of CHF327 million relating to the first phase of the transfer of InvestLab, our open architecture B2B investment fund platform, to the Allfunds Group.
Now if we exclude the initial gain from the transfer, our revenues totaled CHF5.0 billion, which was an increase of 2% year-on-year.If we look at our business lines.
I think this growth demonstrates the strength and the resilience of our franchise across all three of our wealth management-related businesses.If we look at our other operations.
In Global Markets, however, as Tidjane has highlighted already, we have continued to see the benefits of the investments that we've made into this business and of the substantial restructuring that we finished by the end of 2018 as well as a favorable operating environment, which led to revenues increasing by 34% year-on-year.We remain very committed to delivering year-on-year productivity increases across our businesses and our operations, as well as to careful resource management.
Now including the benefit from the reduced tax rate, our net income attributable to shareholders stood at CHF881 million in the third quarter, an increase of 108% year-on-year, that equates to a return on tangible equity of 9% for both the third quarter and for the nine months to the end of September.Next, let's turn to Slide 32, please, and look at capital.
I would note that, for 2019, we continue to expect FINMA-related model and parameter updates to have an adverse impact of approximately CHF6 billion to CHF7 billion in 2019, of which CHF5.8 billion has been absorbed during the first nine months of the year.The net result was a CET1 ratio of 12.4% at the end of the quarter compared to 12.5% at the end of the second quarter, but I would note that this would have been 12.6% absent the update in capital calculations due to the Eurozone exposure runoff that I mentioned before.Now if we turn to leverage.
Incidentally, that means that our risk density currently stands at 33%, approaching the 35% of which the Swiss capital regime has been calibrated.Now I did just want to provide a follow-up to the announcement that we gave on the 2nd of October regarding our decision to continue to report our financial results on overall basis in Swiss francs but to start calculating our operational risk RWA in US dollars, with effect from the beginning of the fourth quarter.
So before distributing capital to shareholders, that led to a tangible book value per share of CHF16.42.As Tidjane said already, growth in book value is a key financial indicator, and we're pleased with the progress in this over the last year.
Now for the sake of clarity and just in order to focus on the underlying operating performance of the divisions, I will focus the bulk of this discussion on their performance excluding the gains from InvestLab. Now without the gain from InvestLab, the Swiss Universal Bank generated CHF1.3 billion, a reduction of 2% year-on-year, driven by lower net interest income as a result of adverse movements to the Swiss franc curve, primarily in our corporate and institutional client business.I'd also highlight that, in the third quarter of 2018, i.e., last year, we booked a CHF15 million gain from the sale of real estate in this division.
And in particular, SUB's collaboration with Global Markets and IWM, International Trading Solutions or ITS made an increased contribution to the division's revenue performance.Now if you exclude InvestLab, pre-tax income was stable at CHF509 million in the third quarter of 2019.
Operating expenses were down by 2% year-on-year at CHF782 million, with a cost/income ratio of 55% and a return on regulatory capital of 18%, including InvestLab.Turning to net new assets.
And as a consequence, the APAC Markets sub division made a loss of USD34 million in the third quarter of the year.Let me turn now to Slide 38 and IBCM.
Whilst we continue to be extremely disciplined on costs across the division this year, IBCM recorded a pre-tax loss of USD16 million for the quarter compared to a pre-tax gain of USD72 million in the same quarter of last year.As we've previously highlighted, we are encouraged by the progress that's being made in technology and healthcare, and we expect to hold on this as we develop our plans to develop incremental revenue growth over the next few years within the division.Let me conclude then with a few words on the performance of Global Markets.
Global Markets pre-tax income for the first nine months this year now amount to USD914 million, a 150% increase compared year-on-year.As we said already, we've continued to see a strong performance in our ITS collaboration, with higher revenues from increased wealth management activity.
This has been combined with a continued sharp focus on resource management, with operating costs down marginally year-on-year at USD1.1 billion.We've also remained very disciplined with the deployment of capital to the division, with RWA and leverage usage similar to the levels that we saw in the third quarter of 2018.
And once we reach book value, we'll have to reconsider this, but until that point, we intend to continue using it, yes.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerI would also be clear that we do intend to increase the dividend by at least 5% per annum from that base.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. On the negative, we charge, and I'm looking at Thomas here, 75 basis point, but we have not disclosed the proportion by level.
As I said, the impact on net interest income is CHF61 million for the fourth quarter of the year.
I think -- I mean, I think, we talked about it a lot at the Investor Day last December and that we wanted to have a culture in which every year both our business divisions and operating functions generate cost savings.
So, I think the first point is we did see, as we said, continued strong capital generation in the third quarter, up at CHF37.4 billion of CET1, which I think is the most important point.
So you get this slightly, I think, perverse result from the mathematics in which a reduction in risk, because I'm very happy we have redeemed those Eurozone exposures, actually leads to about a CHF6 billion increase in RWA in the third quarter.
And then I think, as you said, Tidjane, even with as our work on ITS is still ongoing, 19% increase in PB transactions in the third quarter.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. So I don't see that as a one-off.
",25.23,0.8893403
31,creditsuisse,q4,2019,"Made CHF2 billion in the third and more than CHF3 billion in the fourth year, with a return on tangible equity of 9%, which we believe is a creditable performance in the challenging environment for the industry that we experienced last year.But let's look at '19 in more detail, and this is quite important to me.
And I will come back to this, but you know that we have a similar commitment for 2020.So, what I'd like to do at this point is just pause because we're at the end of a period and look back at the strategy we are following at a kind of high level, getting a little bit away from 4Q and the '19 results.
We wanted our capital level to be adequate, that we would operate with a lot of discipline in costs and generating positive operating leverage, that we would reduce our absolute levels of risk and improve our risk management capabilities and also deal with some significant legacy issues, of which the DOJ and the RMBS issue was the biggest back in 2015.So, looking at growth, the first block.
We've told you many times that IBCM contributes a lot of NNA to the private bank, and that's also unique to our model, very significant, depending on the quarter, 40%, 50% of the flows in Asia, but we've gained market share, as we show you here, every year for the last -- no, sorry, for the last four years.
We said that we would first rightsize and derisk the business, but we aim to achieve in the end cost of capital that we've connected to wealth management, but equities in that strategy was key.
And the return on RWA is now at 11%, so double digits.So I will pause here and summarize this first section to say that we have had a continued improvement in performance in 2019, with a particularly strong fourth quarter, but we have continued to deepen a key aspect of the strategy which is the collaboration between wealth management and investment banking and that we believe, having achieved 9% now, that consistent growth and continued disciplined execution will drive us to double-digit RoTE, which is our ambition.And with that, I'll pass to David to continue and take you through the financials.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you very much, Tidjane.
To be helpful with comparisons and to better illustrate our financial performance, you'll see that I've included a table on this slide that includes our results excluding the gains related, first, to the transfer of the InvestLab fund platform to Allfunds Group that we reported in the third quarter which totaled CHF327 million.
If we were to exclude these, net revenues for the year would have been CHF21.7 billion, an increase of 4%, including the benefit from reduced funding costs.Now if we look at our fourth quarter performance, net revenues increased by 29% year-on-year.
If we look at our major business lines, in 2019, wealth management-related revenues increased by 9% compared to 2018, and that's including the gains from InvestLab and from SIX.
And during the fourth quarter, Wealth management-related revenues increased by 23% year-on-year.
Again excluding the gains from InvestLab and SIX, Wealth management revenues would have been up 2% for the year and up 8% in the final quarter.
Our Markets business across GM and APAC continued to see the benefits of the investments that we've made and of the significant restructuring that we concluded at the end of 2018 as well as a more favorable operating environment, with combined revenues increasing by 10% year-on-year in 2019 and by 43% in the fourth quarter, again both stated on a US dollar basis.Turning to expenses.
Our total operating expenses in 2019, including the increased provision for major litigation items that we took in the fourth quarter, stood at CHF17.4 billion, an increase of 1% compared to 2018.
Now, the bulk of the litigation costs sit in the corporate center, as they primarily relate to legacy matters previously recorded in the Strategic Resolution Unit.Overall, we generated a pre-tax income of CHF4.7 billion last year, an increase of 40% compared to 2018.
Excluding InvestLab and SIX, as well as the major litigation provisions, our pre-tax income would have been CHF4.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 18% year-on-year.
For the fourth quarter, our pre-tax income was CHF1.2 billion, up 104% year-on-year, or up 54% excluding these three items.Now, I previously indicated that we'd expected to reduce our effective tax rate from 40.4% in 2018 to between 28% and 30% for 2019, and I'm pleased to announce today that the rate for last year was 27.4%.
We still expect our tax rate to drop to between 26% and 27% for the year, although it may be lower than that in the first quarter of 2020.Now, including the benefits of the reduction in the tax rate in 2019, our net income attributable to shareholders stood at CHF3.4 billion last year, an increase of 69% year-on-year.
Now, just excluding the impact of SIX and the major litigation provisions, we'd have ended the year at 8.2%, and just for reference, I've included a slide in the appendix to show this reconciliation.Let's turn to Slide 39, please, and let's look at the capital base.
We have already begun our 2020 share repurchase program and I would remind you that we intend to buy back at least CHF1 billion worth of shares in 2020, subject to market and economic conditions.Now if we look at risk-weighted assets, these decreased by CHF12 billion to CHF290 billion, of which CHF6 billion was due to foreign exchange moves, specifically from the strengthening of the Swiss franc against the US dollar at the end of the final quarter of the year.
We also saw a CHF7 billion decrease in net business usage in the fourth quarter, reflecting a continued discipline to RWA deployment, particularly in GM and IBCM.
We continue to expect to see an approximately CHF12 billion impact from the implementation of the first phase of the Basel III reforms in the first quarter in January, of 2020, which we expect will reduce our capital ratio by about 50 basis points and increase our risk density on a pro forma basis to 33%, close to 35% level at which the Swiss capital regime, the TBTF2 regime, had been calibrated.Let's turn now to the cost base, please, on Slide 40.
Throughout the year, we continued to fund strategic investments for growth across the bank, particularly in our wealth management related divisions as well as investments intended to improve digitalization efforts and to boost the bank's level of efficiency, but I would also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm that, as we said at our Investor Day, we would expect to have an adjusted operating cost base of between CHF16.1 billion and CHF16.9 billion for 2020, depending on market conditions.
Now, excluding the gains from InvestLab and SIX, the Swiss Universal Bank generated CHF5.6 billion of revenues in 2019.
Net new assets for the year totaled CHF3.4 billion, a growth rate of 2%.
Revenues for the year excluding InvestLab and SIX were CHF5.6 billion, an increase of 3% in the year.
Net revenues, excluding the InvestLab contribution in the third quarter, were up by 3% year-on-year at CHF3.5 billion in 2019.
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, IBCM revenues were down by 8% as a result of lower M&A and corporate bank results, partly offset by better underwriting activity.
RWA and leverage exposure in the fourth quarter were down compared to the end of the third quarter of 2019, including the impact from certain position exits that we executed in the corporate bank.
This performance, strong performance, and the market share gains we've seen were supported by a significantly more favorable environment, particularly in the fourth quarter, after the slow start to the year, but we are pleased to see the progress as we continue to execute against the strategic initiatives of the division.
Thank you.Mark Smart -- Investor RelationsWe will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference...Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerSorry, sorry.
And we always believe that there was a missed opportunity in terms of entrepreneurs and ultra-high and that we are -- we were uniquely positioned to leverage our investment banking and global market capabilities to drive profit growth and this is why we are quite confident in the future.I will pause here and then effectively, Marc, move to Q&A.Mark Smart -- Investor RelationsWe'll now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference.
So, that's the first question.Second question, I just wanted to pick up on your outlook statement where you talked about strong start to the year and in particular get a view on what you're seeing on the Investment Banking side both in Global Markets and IBCM in terms of activity levels as we're sort of about halfway through the first quarter.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerOkay, thank you, Jeremy.
I don't think about anything particularly planned in the near future, but we obviously do continue to look carefully at our level of real estate usage, particularly in high-cost locations.And the page reference, by the way, Jeremy, would be Page 8 of the media release, which has -- the earnings release, which has the reconciliation because it's -- there's obviously gains in the Swiss Universal Bank and IWM and then there's obviously exit losses in both GM and IBCM.Jeremy Sigee -- Exane BNP Paribas -- AnalystOkay.
And so, yeah, it's the best start of a year we've seen in a while, but you guys have to caveat that with potential discontinuities, etc, but so far, so good.Jeremy Sigee -- Exane BNP Paribas -- AnalystGreat, thank you very muchTidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerOkay, thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley.
If we look at the Global Markets and the IBCM, of course, we have seen very strong end to a year in one and the strong beginning to the year in both, but when you think about it overall, what's the acceptable range of return on regulatory capital that you show that you would accept going forward for those two businesses?Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerOkay.
And I think it's been, I think, just -- I mean Asia, the wealth management thing, I think, has been -- I think that Number 1 in IBCM is remarkable, but ITS is really very important for how we actually organize our bank.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, absolutely.Andrew Coombs -- Citi -- AnalystWell, thank you very much for your detailed answer and for the past 18 quarters as well.
And I think, we come into 2020 with, as Tidjane and Thomas already said, a very strong start to the year.
So if you actually look at Slide 56, you can see that in the fourth quarter of 2018 we had CHF0.9 billion inflows in APAC, CHF0.5 billion in IWM; and an outflow of minus CHF1.1 billion.
And we want to increase continuously the distribution of the structured lending product to ultra-highs and grow -- we like it because it's kind of annuity-based revenues and income.And more generally, if we go back -- I think Slide 27.
So, generally I think there is an expectation and a need of consolidation but not only in Switzerland, but I think it's true for most European countries.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think, thanks to the good work of Thomas and his team, Antoine and others, we are well positioned in that context because in any case, you want to be the low-cost producer, which is the position we got ourselves into, cost/income ratio of 57%.
For a detailed discussion of our results, we refer you to the Credit Suisse fourth quarter 2019 earnings release and remind you that our 2019 Annual Report and audited financial statements for the year will be published on or around March 25.I will now hand you over to Tidjane, who will run through the numbers.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Mark.
It allows you to be close to your clients, to be nimble, and the logic of this market is so different that it makes sense for us to have Switzerland, for instance, and China in two completely separate divisions while extracting the synergies between both businesses.This is possibly one of the most important slides for us.
I'm speaking too fast -- lower-volatility, less capital-consumptive, more capital-efficient, higher-return businesses is what's driven largely the improvement in profitability that you have seen.So we just -- you've seen this slide before, but really this is -- this integration between advisory, underwriting and financing, sales and trading, global market and private banking is -- yes, if there is a secret sauce, it's the secret sauce for us.
So we're quite convinced that we have a very unique model with a unique capability to implement it well and without taking undue risk, and we think that this will show in the coming quarters and years.Another point I'd like to emphasize is that our investment banking capabilities have not suffered from this focus on wealth management.
And that's exactly what's happened with not only revenue growing, but costs continuing to decrease, very good positive operating leverage and which led to the next slide.This is interesting.
I think this growth demonstrates the resilience of our franchise across all three of our wealth management-related businesses.So, if we look at our other operations, our Investment Banking & Capital Markets activities continued to face significant challenges.
Our adjusted operating cost base, consistent with our usual definition, which excludes major litigation items, was CHF16.9 billion, an increase of approximately CHF0.5 billion compared to 2018.
We have also seen accretion in our book value from net share plan accruals and net credit from our UK and Swiss pension funds as well as an increase in retained earnings following the change relating to the accounting of leases.
As you know, the interest rate environment last year was challenging and our net revenues for SUB including the benefit of real estate gains and higher revenues in the year as a whole from International Trading Solutions, the collaboration between SUB, Global Markets and International Wealth Management.
Operating expenses were down 3% year-on-year at CHF3.2 billion, leading to a cost/income ratio of 57% for 2019.Now turning to Private Clients, our pre-tax income excluding the gain from SIX would have been CHF1.2 billion for 2019, an increase of 16%.
And one reason for that resilient performance was the solid inflows that we saw in our high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth segments.Corporate & Institutional Clients pre-tax income, excluding the gains, would have been CHF1.1 billion for '19, stable year-on-year.
I think this concluded a successful year as a whole, with net new assets totaling CHF32.5 billion.
I would note that expenses for the year included the cost of the increased number of relationship managers that we hired during 2019.Let's turn now to Asia Pacific.
We also had a record fourth quarter in terms of pre-tax income at CHF235 million, largely due to momentum in Wealth Management & Connected, with particular strength in advisory, underwriting and financing.Now, if we look at WMC, net revenues for 2019 were also supported by higher private banking revenues with increased net interest income and higher transaction-based revenues.
If I exclude InvestLab, we made pre-tax income of CHF790 million in WMC for 2019, an increase of 14% compared to 2018.Turning to net new assets, we did see some deposit outflows in the period primarily due to continued pressure on margins.
Net new assets totaled CHF8.7 billion in 2019 and CHF700 million in the fourth quarter.Looking at markets, a significantly stronger finish to the year compared to 2018 as well as higher tangible benefits from the Asia Pacific Trading Solutions venture enabled us to breakeven for this business in 2019 in APAC.
Revenues for the fourth quarter are up by 75% against a weak comparative for 4Q '18, within which equity sales and trading revenues increased by 32%.Let's turn to IBCM, please.
Wealth management-related PTI increased by CHF2 billion.
We said 10% RoTE in 2020, expecting to distribute 50% of these, at least CHF1 billion of share buyback and a sustainable ordinary dividend increasing by at least 5% per annum and you see in our announcement today our position on that.So just to wrap up on this story.
We've always believed in the importance of being strong at home and that has been all the strategy behind developing the Swiss Universal Bank, creating it, setting it up and growing it the way we've had under Thomas's leadership.
I mean we don't expect that to happen, but it's a prudent way to manage the capital position of the bank and protect ourselves from downside, yeah.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerI wouldn't read too much into, Andy.
I think it's an appropriate caveat, and I think we are going to say the same thing last year...Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, we said the same thing...David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, it's just an appropriate caveat.
It's really -- it was there before.Andrew Stimpson -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystBut you wouldn't be halting the buyback if you go above tangible book suddenly.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerI don't -- I mean I think that's -- I think we've said that we intend to buy back at least CHF1 billion of shares this year, subject to market and our conditions.
So, I remain among the people who think that this is going to be managed, but clearly if it lasts a long time, it will have an impact on sentiment and client, consumers, but we have not seen that yet.Andrew Stimpson -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystOkay.
Please ask your question.Jeremy Sigee -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst[Technical Issues] all the clarity you gave on the costs because I was wondering why they haven't flexed down like last year...Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerJeremy, sorry -- Jeremy, we missed the first part.
Those do reduce coming into the new quarter.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerRight.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah, OK.
Is it, would you manage to positive jaws at all times or the absolute cost guidance that you have given us?Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerOkay.
Gottstein -- Chief Executive Officer, Swiss Universal Bank and Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AGYes. I hope you can hear me.
And we think that on average it should be able to hit 14%, 15% return on capital.Magdalena Stoklosa -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystThank you.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi.
I think the number of banks organized regionally is increasing now.
I think the second question was actually over the...Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerStructured products.
And I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about, within Asia and as well as within Europe, pressure within the private banking compensation levels and fighting for talent and, in that context, breakeven points of new advisors that you hire and how we should think about net expansion of those.And then the second question is to, Tidjane, to your comments about environment that you gave earlier where you indicated wealth management Asia is very strong so far, this year.
",35.88,0.64967346
32,creditsuisse,q1,2020,"Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures.
We would also like to remind you that our Annual General Meeting of shareholders will be taking place next week, on April 30.I will now hand over to our CEO, Thomas Gottstein and CFO, David Mathers, who will run through the numbers.Thomas Gottstein -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Kinner.
And, to further protect our capital base, we have suspended our share back -- buyback program and delayed the decision on the second half of our 2019 dividend until later in the year as previously communicated.Finally, and as you may have seen from our announcement last week, we received regulatory approval to become a majority shareholder in our securities joint venture, Credit Suisse Founder Securities Limited, marking a significant milestone in the Bank's China strategy.Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to look at our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in a little more detail.
Overall, Private Banking net revenues rose 9% and this excludes the gain from InvestLab, showing continued strong momentum in these businesses.Next slide, please.
During periods of market dislocation, as we are currently in, Private Clients are often seeking innovative solutions in order to protect their positions and best-in-class trading execution across all asset classes, including equities, bonds, FX, OTC derivatives and structured products.
As Thomas has mentioned before, Credit Suisse's businesses delivered a resilient first quarter despite the challenging market and operational environment.
Now, these are similar but substantially more conservative than IFRS 9, which was introduced for reporters a year ago and the difference -- there was a number of differences but the most important one relevant today is the CECL includes a provision for losses over the entire life of the loan, which we continuously assess depending on our assessment of the economic outlook, whereas IFRS 9 requires that for only one year under most conditions.So, if we look at the chart on the left, first we're reflecting our allowance for credit losses for our loan book.
Now, this is important because Credit Suisse has a higher proportion of fair value-related assets on its balance sheet than many other banks.
The Swiss Universal Bank saw strong results across all major revenue lines with increased client activity and higher revenues from International Trading Solutions.
Operating expenses in SUB was stable with investments in growth offset by ongoing cost discipline measures.Now, as Thomas has already said, as part of our efforts to support our home market, our clients and our communities, we granted bridging loans worth approximately CHF2.4 billion to support small and medium enterprises as part of the Swiss gain.Now, if we turn to Private Clients, net revenues increased by 8%, with increases across all major revenue categories and exceptionally high levels of client activity.
However, we also recorded net asset outflows of CHF4.2 billion, mostly driven by a single, low margin outflow in the ultra-high net worth segment.Corporate and Institutional Clients, excluding the gain from InvestLab transfer, reported an 8% increase in net revenues year-on-year and that was driven by strong ITS and by strong Investment Banking revenues.
Our International Wealth Management division saw high levels of client activity during the first quarter with resilient asset-based revenues and net interest income, but we did suffer unrealized losses on fund investments within the asset management business.
Net revenues excluding InvestLab were down by 9%.If we look at Private Banking, pre-tax income was down by 7% year-on-year, but that does include the CHF15 million gain from the InvestLab transfer.
Net revenues excluding InvestLab were up by 17% at CHF1 billion in the first quarter and this was largely due to strong results within Private Banking within WM&C, as well as by APAC Markets.
This offset unrealized mark-to-market financing losses on the fair valued lending portfolio in our financing businesses and included in WM&C.So, if you look at WM&C, if we exclude InvestLab, pre-tax income was CHF60 million and that included CHF160 million unrealized mark-to-market moves on our fair valued lending portfolio in the financing businesses and CHF96 million of provisions against credit losses, mainly related to three single cases, the largest of which was caused by a single default on a share-backed loan linked to a Chinese food and beverage company.We saw record Private Banking revenues this quarter as transaction-based revenues increased by 67% year-on-year.
Net new assets totaled CHF3 billion, I think that's a stable performance given market conditions.If we turn to APAC Markets, we saw a strong performance with high level of transaction and gains from hedging.
If we would exclude those, then division would have seen net revenues up by about 4% year-on-year.As I've already said, IBCM's results were adversely affected by negative developments in our Corporate Bank, which is split with Global Markets.
Amid this profound market dislocation and despite significant reserve building, we delivered solid first quarter financial results and saw a good revenue momentum in Private Banking, as well as in our sales and trading businesses.
I actually also included the leverage finance exposure numbers, which I think we did give at the MS conference last last month.
So hopefully that answers those two points, in terms of that component reserve build.I think on the Asset Management point I made before, there's about CHF100 million of impairments, of which around two-thirds relates either to seed money or to joint ventures or partners.
I think it's actually on page 30, that we take net losses of CHF51 million for hedges on uncollateralized corporate derivative exposure.
Excluding the provision for credit losses, mark-to-market losses and gains from the InvestLab transfer, our pre-tax income for the quarter would have been CHF1.9 billion, a 66% increase year-on-year.
Excluding the gains from the transfer but including the over CHF1 billion reserve build, which we will cover later in this presentation, pre-tax income was down 11% on the same quarter of last year.Next slide, please.
Excluding the mark-to-market losses of $459 million incurred in the first quarter, overall, Investment Banking net revenues stood at CHF2.9 billion, up 23% on the same quarter a year ago.Next slide, please.
At CHF1.9 billion, this represents a CHF773 million increase compared to the same quarter of last year and shows that we have further strengthened our combined Private Banking and Investment Banking franchise, our profitability and delivered substantial operating leverage.And with that, I would like to hand over to David for the discussion of our financial results in more detail.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Thomas.
If we were to exclude those gains, net revenues for the quarter would have been CHF5.5 billion and that's an increase of 2% year-on-year.Now, just looking at our business lines.
In the first quarter, Wealth Management-related revenues increased by 7% compared to the same quarter in 2019, again including InvestLab. Wealth Management-related results excluding that gain, suffered from mark-to-market losses, say in Asset Management and in the APAC Financing Group portfolio.
We saw an increase of 9% compared to the prior year, and overall within Private Banking, we saw significant growth in transaction revenues, as well as a resilient result in net interest income and in recurring commissions and fees.If we look at our other operations, our markets businesses across both GM and Asia Pacific, we saw a combined revenue growth of 22% for the quarter, stated in US dollars.
These businesses benefit from a significant increase in market volumes and volatility during the quarter.Our Investment Banking and Capital Markets activities had an initially strong start to the year and we saw a pick-up of momentum and deal closings in January and February.
We saw these provisions across all divisions, but in particular, they were focused on the Corporate Bank, which adversely affected IBCM and GM, as well as our credit exposures in Asia Pacific.I think it's clear that given the deterioration in the operating environment, cost management is going to remain critical this year.
We're going to remain very disciplined on costs for the whole of 2020, with adjusted operating expenses expected to be around the CHF16 billion level.Overall, and notwithstanding the substantial reserve build, we generated pre-tax income of CHF1.2 billion in the quarter and that's an increase of 13% year-on-year.As we've noted, and as Thomas has already referred to, our effective tax rate for the quarter was negative.
And if I look forward to the full-year 2020, given this improvement, I'd reduce our guidance for the 2020 tax rate from the 26% to 27% level that I gave at the Investor Day last December, to be at the lower range of 20% to 25% for the current year.Net income to shareholders stood at CHF1.3 billion and that's an increase of 75% year-on-year, and equated to a return of tangible equity of 13.1% for the first quarter.
Now, already included in this capital ratio, both at the end of last year and at the end of the first quarter, is a full capital reduction for the full-year 2019 dividend, both for the first payment of CHF0.1388 that our shareholders will vote on at the AGM next week, and for the second payment, the Board will review in the autumn and would intend thereafter to propose to an Extraordinary General Meeting at the beginning of the fourth quarter.Now, given market volatility and the overall pressure on the global economy, the Swiss regulator, FINMA, has decided to phase in the CHF12 billion of RWA inflation from the Basel III reforms, primarily related to SA-CCR and certain other measures, which we briefed you on the past, over the whole of 2020.
And clearly, as I've noted already, we also saw a CHF3 billion increase in RWA from the phase-in of the SA-CCR and related Basel III reforms.Our share buyback program is on hold until at least the third quarter of 2020, when we will then reassess our position, and I would hope that will give you a better understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the markets and the economies in which we operate.Just in terms of guidance for the CET1 ratio for the balance of 2020, given the industry and marketwide increases in risk-weighted assets due to the heightened level of volatility and increased lending drawdowns and adverse migrations, together with the phase-in of the SA-CCR measures, I think it's prudent to say that I would expect us to operate at a CET1 ratio of around 11.5% for the balance of this year rather than the 12% that we previously guided.Let's turn now to leverage, please.
The CET1 leverage ratio, excluding net cash held at central banks stood at 4.2% at the end of the first quarter.Now, our leverage ratio increased through the quarter on a like-for-like basis due to the market volatility that we saw and the increases in net cash positions that we held at central banks, but this was then offset by the exclusion of those increased Central Bank deposits, subject to the dividend adjustment as FINMA permits.If you look at the chart, you can see -- that you can see first the impact of the strength in the Swiss franc, which led to a CHF10 billion reduction in leverage.
We then saw a CHF43 billion increase in leverage exposure in certain parts of our businesses in the first quarter, and that was primarily in Global Markets and reflects the market volatility, increased margin requirements that we saw in March, increased sales, drawdowns in the corporate banking book, as well as reduced netting at quarter end.
These increases were then offset by the exclusion of the Central Bank deposits, so that led to an overall reduction in leverage of CHF40 billion.Now, just in terms of the absolute amount of leverage, I would expect the adverse impact on leverage from volatility to largely normalize during the course of 2020.
Clearly, COVID-19 and the move to remote working for some -- much of our workforce does provide the potential to reduce our costs in certain areas, but it will increase in others.Just in terms of guidance, as I said, we're going to be very disciplined for 2020, and I think I'd expect adjusted operating expenses to be at around the CHF16 billion level.Let's turn to tangible book value per share, please.
Now, just recognizing that this should only be a temporary change, without it, our tangible book value per share would have been CHF16.44, an increase of 4% on the quarter.So, let's now turn to our credit provisions, please, and look at the overall reserve build that we took in the first quarter.
Net write-offs and other adjustments, i.e., things we've realized charge-offs generated a reduction of CHF55 billion, and that left our allowance for credit losses on loans amortized cost of CHF1.7 billion, an increase of CHF585 million compared to the previous quarter.Now, if we move to the second chart, we combine the movement of credit provisions with other unrealized credit-related exposures.
Net new assets for Private Banking in the first quarter pretty good, CHF3.7 billion, that's a 4% annualized growth rate.Just turning to Asset Management, excluding the CHF203 million InvestLab gain, as well as the unrealized losses on seed money in the Asset Management funds of CHF101 million, we made a pre-tax income of CHF60 million.
Pre-tax income in the first quarter increased by 21% year-on-year on a 14% increase in revenues, and as Thomas has already said, we saw robust ITS revenues in the first quarter, reflecting higher volatility and continued momentum with Wealth and Institutional Clients.If we look at the main business lines, fixed income revenues were up by 17% year-on-year with higher trading activity in macro and global credit products, offsetting unrealized mark-to-market losses in leveraged finance.
Clearly, GM has also suffered its share of the increase in credit provisions in the Corporate Bank, both specific and CECL linked, which I've already covered.Now, as I mentioned before, RWA and leverage exposure for Global Markets increased due to the significant increase in market volatility in the second half of the quarter.
That's up from $58 billion in the same quarter a year ago.With regard to leverage, we saw a similar step-up due to volatility, increased margin requirements, a high level of fails at the end of March, GM's share of the drawdowns in the corporate banking book, as well as reduced netting.
I think if we looked at the CET1 ratio that we reported for the end of the first quarter of 12.1%, I mean, it was similar to what we guided to back on the 13th of February when we did our end -- year-end numbers, but obviously the components were notably different, because rather than CHF12 billion of SA-CCR and related impact, we only had CHF3 billion and yet you end up with the same number.
The one point I just want to make clear too, Magdalena, is that -- I think I did refer to this middle of last year at some point, which is the capital deductions under the IRB approach for credit losses actually exceeds the the CECL effect.
Over the next, you know, two, three quarters with COVID-19 and the impact of it, the RoTE is going to be challenged, but it's still clearly our goal to be at or above 10%, because that's where we think in a normalized world, the cost of equity is of our business and we want to earn in excess of that.Maybe I will hand over to David for the risk cost, then I will take IB franchise question and then the fourth question around on credit, back to David.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerOkay.
So at the limit and obviously there was a degree of comfort, and what we said on March 18, you'd be talking about a loss between CHF106.2 million to CHF933 million, which I think is CHF129 million.Now so -- if we then look at the various provisions we actually took, you really have got the mark to market move in the leverage finance book, which was CHF284 million that was taken entirely in March.
Obviously the biggest thing was, this transfer of a single, low margin ultra high net worth mandates from Credit Suisse to a different bank, which was the bulk of what you actually saw in SUB, and that was definitely not related in any way to a leverage loan.I think we have seen some deleveraging as you'd expect and face these markets and if you actually look at the components of assets under management, it's up to about 32% cash now across all three of our private banking business.
If CECL losses were to increase by CHF200 million that's some subsequent call it -- some subsequent quarter from the level they are now, than basically we would start see a capital reduction and then we'd be -- then I think that's when the phasing question actually kicks in.

33,deutschebank,q2,2019,"Again, these ratios are among the highest of all our European and global peers and provide a good base for our transformation.Most of the numbers we show you today will be based on our current business setup, but slide 3 gives a sense of our performance on a pro forma basis in the new reporting structure.
FIC, as I said before, actually performed a lot better than the headline revenue indicates given some specific items running against us, and I cannot see that this underlying solid performance is changing in the second half of 2019.Our successful transformation must be based on continued cost discipline.
Tangible book value per share of 24.49 euros declined by 5% compared to the prior quarter, principally reflecting the DTA item.In addition, as Christian noted, and as we show on slides 23 and 24, we have made certain refinements in our pro forma disclosures.
In aggregate, these refinements amount to approximately 550 million euros, or 2.5% of total core bank revenues, as originally laid out.These represent decisions taken by the newly established management team around the business perimeter, consistent with our overall strategic transformations.
We then look forward to giving you more details on our strategy on the Investor Day during Q4.To give you a better sense of our underlying performance this quarter, slide 9 shows the impacts of the strategic transformation and revised planning assumptions.
We also further rebalanced our business mix to more stable sources, as loan growth only partly offset the 17-billion-euro reduction in leverage exposure in our sales and trading operations.With that, let me now turn to our segment results based on the reporting structure prior to the strategic plan.
Excluding these impairments, non-interest expenses declined by 4%, with a 7% reduction in adjusted costs, reflecting the strategic actions taken in 2018 and continued cost discipline.Provisions for credit losses of 72 million euros remained at low levels, but did increase from the prior-year period.
Debt origination revenues declined, reflecting a weaker market environment, specifically in leveraged loans, where volumes decreased by approximately 50% compared to the prior-year quarter.
Equity sales and trading revenues declined 32% versus the prior year, driven by significant reductions in cash equities and prime finance, principally reflecting the uncertainty regarding our strategic decisions.Slide 15 shows the results of our private and commercial bank.
Revenues of 2.5 billion euros declined by 2% year on year on a reported basis, but grew by 2.2% in our ongoing businesses, excluding specific items.Non-interest expenses of 2.6 billion euros included impairments related to our strategic plan of 557 million euros.
This reflects the low-risk nature of our portfolios and the benefit of approximately 35 million euros of incremental gains on portfolio sales.Turning to revenues by business in PCB on slide 16, revenues in our ongoing businesses in PCB decreased by 1% on a reported basis, but grew by 2% excluding specific items.
Results included 239 million euros of valuation and timing differences, mainly reflecting the impact of cross-currency basis gains related to our U.S. dollar funding, as spreads widened during the quarter.During the second half of this year, we will roll out our new framework for funds transfer pricing, better aligning remuneration and charges with funding provision and usage across our businesses.
We expect these retained funding costs to result in contra-revenues of no more than 200-300 million euros in 2020, with offsetting improvements in our operating businesses.
Second, we must continue to demonstrate ongoing cost discipline as we work toward our 21.5-billion-euro adjusted cost target, excluding the adjusted cost items related to the strategic transformation.Our full-year guidance for provisions for credit losses remains unchanged.
My second question was really on potential rate cuts in Europe and tiering, and really, comparing this to the expectation on one of the slides a couple of weeks back when we talked about the new strategy, how your short-term rates should support revenues in two years or so.
So, firstly, I'd like to know whether the decision to keep parts of the equities business might actually end up undermining the argument to release the operational risk-weighted assets there, because as I understood it, the argument was that if it was a full exit, then you could delete the equities assumption from your op risk-weighted asset calculations, but if you're keeping another 550 million euros, just interested in your discussions with the regulator how that might affect those assumptions.And then, secondly, you said about 13% by year end, so with the extra 30 bps of headwinds you're going to see from regular inflation and restructuring from here, but the inflation you're talking about from -- was it slide 29 from the presentation a few weeks ago?
I think we have a strong competitive or franchise advantage in generating those loans, and while pricing is competitive in today's yield-starved environment, we have found good opportunities to put the balance sheet to work to support our clients.Magdalena Stoklosa -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorAnd James, geographically in CIB, is this across -- where do you see the best demand?James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerIt's global, but I'd say if there's a concentration or -- the opportunity is really in the U.S., so, in U.S. dollar product, and particularly, that's where the strength of those ABS and CRE franchises lies.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Stuart Graham of Autonomous Research.Stuart Graham -- Autonomous Research -- PartnerOh, hi.
Of course, some element of this 550 million euros would probably decline as it's exposed to the change associated with our equity sales and trading platform, but this gives us the opportunity to preserve as much as possible, and as Christian said earlier, preserve a coherent product capability for that core corporate client base going forward.
As part of our longer-term plan, the new management team and I set three objectives for 2019 in our announcement earlier this month.First, we must stabilize and grow revenues in our core bank, and today, we showed continuing signs of progress.
In our core investment bank, work has begun to stabilize the revenue base and build the foundation to drive returns higher.Second, this is the sixth quarter in a row where we reduced adjusted costs on a year-on-year basis when excluding the cost related to our strategic transformation and bank levies.
And, that leaves another 4%, which we are confident we can make up with our refocused investment bank, and given some of the leading indicators -- for instance, growth -- in our lending business.But, we offset the decline in revenues with reductions in adjusted cost, which also fell by 4%.
The increase in risk-weighted assets in the core bank mainly reflected loan growth and partly offset the 13-billion-euro decline in the Capital Release Unit.Revenues in our more controllable business of PCB, GTB, and asset management were broadly stable in the first half of 2019, excluding specific items, as shown on slide 4.
Our pipeline in leveraged debt capital markets has also increased slightly, and we expect to continue to grow our revenues in our lending businesses with credit rating reflecting the ongoing loan and asset growth we have generated.
To reach our recently lowered target of 25.1 billion euros for the full year, we must reduce our adjusted costs by a further 500 million euros in the second half to 10.2 billion euros, and based on our detailed bottom-up planning, we are confident that we can generate these savings from several areas.First, from the private bank in Germany, where we recently reached an agreement with the workers' council to restructure the head office and operations functions.
Turning to a summary of our second-quarter results on slide 8, revenues of 6.2 billion euros were down 6% year on year on a reported basis and by 5% excluding the specific items detailed on slide 21 of the presentation.
These changes adjust revenues allocated to the Capital Release Unit back to the core bank, while the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure are in line with our original perimeter.
Risk-weighted assets were broadly flat, as growth in credit risk RWA and inflation from the regulatory review of internal models was offset by lower operational and market risk RWA, as well as by FX translation.In line with our previous guidance, we expect our CET1 ratio to be around 13% at the end of the year, including approximately 2 billion euros of impact on CET1 capital from the additional transformation charges and lower risk-weighted assets in the Capital Release Unit.
As you've seen in the first half of 2019, we grew revenues in PCB, GTB, and asset management despite the challenging environment, and the leading indicators, including loan growth and net flows, are positive, and we are confident that our refocused investment bank is on a good path given the strength of the franchises and the new strategic clarity.
And, the second question is given the change -- and also, a comment you made around the timing of the sale of the equities business to BNP -- how does it change, if at all, the planned runoff profile of risk-weighted assets and leverage out to 2022, and does it change your estimates at the endpoint?
Thanks.Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Jon. And, in the case of the refinements we are providing today, this represents a final set of parameter decisions and asset selections now, with the benefit of a more detailed input and decision-making on the part of the business leadership that is now in place.
Hence, the parameter represents materially the same degree of capital relief, but -- and, that was the driving factor, again, from a client point of view, but with less revenue loss.On the expense side, I defer to James, but we currently show no difference, as the net cost impact of the assets and activities going in and out of the CRU parameter were kind of broadly offsetting.
While this improves the core bank cost/income ratio slightly, it means, of course, we will need to execute effectively on both the de-risking and the expense takeout in the CRU to achieve the results we expect from the transformation overall.And, of course, it goes without saying we will report to you with additional detail when we publish our new financial data supplement, likely in early October, and then, even in greater detail in the Q3 earnings call, and ultimately, our Investor Day in Q4, when you will meet the management teams responsible for both the core bank and the CRU.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerSure, thank you.
We would estimate only about 1 billion euros of RWA difference between closing this year or next.Obviously, from a leverage exposure perspective, it's much more significant -- in the high 20s or low 30s -- but that, again, depends on how quickly we can move assets and novate client balances post, if you like, the legal closing of the transaction.
For the other questions, I refer to James.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, on MDA, our -- obviously, we're level this year at the 11.8%, but as we said on the 8th, it certainly is our hope and expectation that over time, our P2R will decline, reflecting, frankly, the transformed business model that we are moving toward.
So, the 12.7% is really just, in some ways, a starting point, and on the first end, we deliver and continue to manage the capital to preserve a buffer to that 12.5% throughout the year.Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive OfficerAndy, potentially one additional information on your first question, in particular with regard to the operational risk-weighted assets.
I was just wondering if you can update that number for the reclassification that was now made, and then, secondly, if you could give us the return on tangible for the core bank for the first half of this year as well.The second question I have is on the leverage exposure and risk-weighted assets in the CRU.
Clearly, things have moved very quickly post the end of the second quarter, which is obviously the scope of this presentation, but would it be possible to get an update or at least a steer as to where you are in the CRU leverage exposure in risk-weighted assets as things stand now, if there's been substantial movement post the announcement of the plan?The third question I have is just on BNP as a clarification question.
Obviously, those countermeasures go from relatively small impact on the franchise to greater and greater impact depending on the unexpected event, but the reality is a lot of what exists in planning is, frankly, expected, and so, by and large, we have the opportunity to adjust our plans on a timely basis, and that's what we're referring to when we talk about our robust preparations.Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive OfficerKian, to your second question, first of all, you cannot even believe what corporate clarity actually means to the bank.
",16.06,0.6784049
34,deutschebank,q3,2019,"Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was stable in the quarter and at the high-end of our international peer group.Second, we said we would refocus our strategy on four core businesses which has strong positions in attractive markets and which are all profitable.
We continue to deploy balance sheet in our core lending franchises and benefited from strong capital markets activity, most notably in asset-backed securities and commercial real estate.And FX revenues were resilient in the phase of further declines and market volatility.
We are confident in reaching our full year target of reducing leverage exposure in the Capital Release Unit to around EUR120 billion.Our leverage target assumes that we closed the transfer unit with BNP Paribas for Prime Finance and Electronic Equities in the fourth quarter.
FX4Cash, our online real-time FX hedging tool developed in partnership between the corporate bank and the investment bank at its best revenue quarter ever.The good growth we showed in Wealth Management was in part driven by the performance of our family office and institutional wealth initiatives which are run in partnership with the investment bank.
This includes EUR234 million of restructuring and severance and just under EUR200 million of transformation related charges reported within our adjusted costs.Transformation charges in the quarter consisted primarily of software impairments as we implement our technology transformation to help reduce costs in future periods.
Excluding these benefits, provisions for credit losses increased, reflecting lower recoveries and higher provisions taken on defaulted and impaired exposures.Our net loss was EUR832 million, the negative tax rate includes EUR380 million of deferred tax asset valuation adjustments taken during the quarter that we anticipated and communicated to you when we launched our strategy in July.
Core bank pre-tax profit of EUR353 million included EUR315 million of restructuring and severance, transformation related charges and a negative impact from specific revenue items, all of which are detailed in the appendix.Core bank revenues were EUR5.6 billion, excluding specific items down 3% with around half of the decline coming from corporate and other.
Both risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure increased in the Core bank as we grew business volumes, including 9% loan growth year-on-year in selected core client segments.Turning to adjusted costs on Slide nine, we reduced adjusted costs by EUR296 million or 5% year-on-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and EUR186 million of transformation charges.
Excluding operational risk, de-risking in the Capital Release Unit generated almost 25 basis points of capital offset by around 16 [Phonetic] basis points of growth in the core bank and about 5 basis points of regulatory headwinds associated with the targeted review of internal models we have discussed previously.Together with the negative impact of our transformation charges on earnings, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was stable at 13.4%.
We reaffirm our target to manage our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio around 13% in the fourth quarter with the decline driven by multiple factors including transformation charges and updates to pension liabilities, including tax effects.
Our fully loaded leverage ratio was stable at 3.9% in the quarter despite a headwind from foreign exchange translation.On an exchange rate neutral basis, we reduced leverage exposure by EUR39 billion including EUR77 billion of de-leveraging in the Capital Release Unit.
Excluding these items, corporate bank revenues grew by around 2% on an underlying basis.Adjusted costs excluding transformation charges were EUR973 million flat to the prior quarter, but up substantially versus the prior year.
We set three objectives for our investment bank; stabilize revenues, reallocate resources and reduce costs and the management team made progress on all three this quarter.
The decline partly reflects around 500 in-voluntary leavers during the quarter, the run rate effect of strategic actions taken in recent periods and lower internal service cost allocations.Turning to the Investment Bank's revenue performance by business on Slide 15.
We believe the performance has now stabilized under new leadership with improved results in September.As Christian said, we are committed to maintaining robust and broad-based rates and emerging markets franchises and have taken specific actions to restructure these businesses.
Advisory revenues grew by more than 50% reflecting strong performance in the Americas, healthcare and industrials and benefited from the closing of certain deals originally expected in the fourth quarter.The outperformance versus the global fee pools was driven by strength in Debt Origination revenues with our leveraged loan and high yield businesses, both gaining market share in the quarter according to Dealogic.
Revenues declined by 2% adjusted for specific items as growth in business volumes partly offset the negative impact of lower interest rates.
We reduced adjusted costs excluding transformation charges by 1%.Synergy benefits from our German integration offset our ongoing investments in wealth management and higher internal service cost allocations.
We grew net new assets, net new loans and revenues, most notably in Asia and in the Americas and from our institutional wealth partnership and family office initiatives in conjunction with the investment bank.The growth in Wealth Management was in part driven by our select hiring programs where we've increased revenue generating staff by more than 10% in the last four quarters.
Despite the industry wide fee pressures, revenues were essentially flat year-on-year, excluding the negative impact of falling interest rates on the fair value of guarantees in select retirement products.Adjusted costs were down 6% excluding transformation charges reflecting successful delivery on cost initiatives.
So what -- just interested, what drove that increase and is that a seasonal, could that unwind into year-end at all.And then secondly on the private bank, the new time series that we all had made it seem like costs were going to come down much quicker than I guess it's partly a problem with getting used to that -- the new time series in any seasonality there perhaps, but underlying costs were up 3% quarter-on-quarter.The slides there referenced wealth management hiring.
What I'm trying to understand is how much will it cost you on average to reduce risk weighted assets, so we can clearly assume some kind of revenue reduction in our models, if you can help us with that.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerSure, Kian, thank you for the questions and I'll start on them and Christian may want to add.
Is there any relationship that you can put against risk weighted assets on any other context and if I just may ask one more time, the EUR600 million on interest rates, clearly the curve has moved further out from May. So if I would do a rerun of your numbers of how much come from interest rate, that number would be significantly bigger today than EUR600 million, is that correct?Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Management BoardSo the -- what we pulled aside in May as interest rate related or driven that would all, or most or more would disappear.
It's not really against the ongoing quarterly level of CLP that we're taking.Stuart Graham -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystOkay.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerStuart on your second question, it really comes down and plays down to our strengths and to our core DNA as a financing bank.
Today, we can tell you, we are on track, the trends in the core bank, the performance in the Capital Release Unit, headcount, costs and capital are all running in line with or better than we planned.The longer-term story will be a key part of what we discussed with you at the Investor Deep Dive on the 10th of December, I hope as many of you can join us for that.Today, I will focus on the progress we made in the quarter toward our four objectives for 2019, starting on Slide one.
And of course, the performance also reflects some impact from the fundamental transformation that we have launched in July.This quarter we need to look beneath the headline results.In the private bank, we offset most of the interest rate headwinds with solid growth in Wealth Management, and our International business.
We see this as a satisfactory result in particular, given the uncertainties around our strategy at the start of the quarter.Our transformation did have an impact on our performance in the Investment Bank, although the trends were in line with our internal targets and we believe that we are starting to -- that we are starting to put these issues of uncertainty now behind us.
Stripping out transformation related charges which James will discuss in a moment, our adjusted costs were EUR5.2 billion in the quarter, excluding these charges and bank levies, we recorded our seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year reductions and again, we are in-line with our plan and guidance we gave you last time, compared to the first quarter of 2018, we have reduced our quarterly adjusted costs by around EUR450 million or EUR1.8 billion on an annualized basis.
Adjusting for a specific items detailed on Slide 23 of the presentation, revenues were EUR5.4 billion in the quarter, down 12% year-on-year, the decline was driven by lower revenues in the capital release unit and corporate and other.
In Commercial Banking in Germany, revenues rose by 1% driven by loan growth of EUR4 billion, which helped offset the pressure of low or negative interest rates.With that, a few words on the Investment Bank on Slide 14.
In financing, our biggest business within FIC, revenues grew, reflecting increased client activity and the benefit of loan growth, I mentioned earlier.In flow credit, revenues rose year-on-year, as we started to benefit from investments in previous periods, while distressed debt trading revenues declined from a strong prior-year quarter and reflecting the episodic nature of that business.
In rates, results were impacted by our business restructuring and by the loss of EUR37 million on a specific investment as detailed on Slide 23 of the appendix.
Having generated approximately EUR150 million of cost synergies in the year-to-date, we are on track with the integration of our German operations.Provision for credit losses benefited from the factors I mentioned earlier and a 13 basis points of loans year-to-date remained at a low level, reflecting the low risk nature of our private bank portfolios.
We grew loans by EUR4 billion and assets under management also increased by EUR4 billion in the quarter.A few words on the revenue performance by business on Slide 17.
We reduced adjusted costs excluding transformation charges by 6% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower headcount and we've begun to implement our non-compensation cost reduction measures.We realize that the capital release unit is hard to model from the outside, so we want to give you a sense of what it will look like.
As we have said before, we are focused on growing revenues in our less market-sensitive businesses and building on the momentum we can see in the investment bank.Current market expectations for forward interest rates present a headwind to our revenue aspirations for 2022 that we outlined in our July presentation.
First, the perimeter adjustments we announced with the second quarter results, increased revenues in the core bank.Second, our businesses have begun more systematically pricing and charging for negative rates and the corporate bank and wealth management are well advanced working with clients on this.
Obviously, it's important, and we're very focused on maintaining a sufficient buffer above our MDA triggers, and hence the guidance we provided in terms of capital ranges and our minimum levels going forward.On the transformation charges, you're correct to point to page 25 in the July presentation, and as we look to 2020 and beyond, our view right now and our planning is entirely consistent with where we were in July.
You know, that in particular, in Europe, Deutsche Bank has always seen as a DNA as the corporate bank and to focus on that with its own division, with a strong financing business, with a strong transaction bank is obviously welcomed.We can -- in particular also see the bridge from Germany into Asia, by the way, that is partially an answer also to your third question that the internationality, which we can offer to the corporate's and which is unchanged and actually where we further invest into is highly welcomed and therefore I'm not only pleased about the 6% revenue increase which we saw in Q3, but I am confident that we see further revenue increases then going forward.On the institutional client side, the echo was also positive for the first reason, because we presented clarity.
And in Germany, to your question, this transaction bank also makes a difference actually versus our competitors, not only the one you mentioned, but also the other ones.I think the international business, we offer for the Corporate through the transaction bank is of a big competitive advantage, providing also for upside, obviously in the profitability and in the retail business or in the private banking business, we are even more focused on the affluent business and there we are more focused on the fee income business.
So it is a very granular and sort of individual discussion, hence my reticence about telling you the entire one-fifth, we'd actually execute on.I would also say in the period of time, leading up to and subsequent to the ECB action, I would say we do see a sort of a change in sentiment, especially in the German market where the market environment generally has begun to recognize that the banks can no longer shield clients from the -- the cost of the negative interest rate policy, and so the early days, the early experience in terms of client reaction would tell us, you're unlikely to see as big of an impact and an expectation that we have that some of this will be a broader market event than simply one banking house.Jernej Omahen -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThank you very much.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Jon Peace with Credit Suisse.
In the rounding, our 2022 revenue expectation was about EUR24.8 billion, we've talked about seeing obviously, interest rate related headwinds that we -- that we are suffering on a forward basis there.
Just as a reminder, our adjusted cost definition in ordinary circumstances includes things like amortization or impairments of software intangibles in certain of the real estate actions that we're taking, but given the size at the moment and the non-recurring nature, we've pulled those out and shown the impact of those charges quite transparently, and so you're right that the operating cost number would be about EUR1 billion higher than the EUR21.5 billion, ECB ex-transformation charges.On Basel 4, look, the implementation is dynamic in some respects.
But we continue to work toward the targets that we set in July.Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Management BoardThere's not a lot to add from my side, potentially, I mean on the private bank, on the revenue side as James was saying, I think we have intensified all our measures to reprice, but also again to increase our efforts to move deposits in other kind of investments, but also think about that obviously in order to compensate for potential headwinds, James and you were outlining, we also have a project under review to merge the PFK AG into DB AG.
And then obviously looking also for further measures.On the CRU de-risking costs, as you pointed out with the sort of specific items that we call out this quarter of DVA and a methodology, a valuation methodology adjustment on some positions in CRU, I don't think that this quarter is -- is going to be representative of de-risking costs as a percentage of the asset reduction.
So we wanted to be able to separate what we'd think of as underlying growth from loan growth from fee and commission income growth, from assets under management growth, essentially those non balance sheet items from the interest rate impact and that was the compound growth rate we were talking about.In terms of the revenue picture in CRU, the portfolio itself doesn't throw-off a significant amount of revenue, especially on the derivative side.
We have the strengths, we have the client franchise and in particular, it was the focus on this business, there is obviously even more demand.Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Management BoardStuart, one other just a thing to point out, is -- FX is a significant part of that growth.
I think we quite in detail said how much and how intense -- intensified we have our work on repricing, in particular in the Corporate Bank, but also in parts of the Private Bank.And now, while this is still 2.5 years or 3 years out, I'd tell you, if I simply look at the Q3 revenues in the Core Bank, including by the way in the investment bank and compare that to our internal plan numbers, we are clearly better than our internal plan.
And therefore, I think we are rightly set up and I'm confident that we can reach our targets there.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerSo Andrew, on balance sheet optimization, just a short answer to your LCR question, we published 139 this quarter, and we'd indicated in the past that we do see opportunity to continue to bring that lower, prudently, but toward more like 130.
So that's the first question.The second one is how should we think about the impact of the roll-off of the equity business in the transaction bank in particular?
",14.33,0.74935764
35,deutschebank,q4,2019,"We delivered our eighth quarter in a row of year-on-year reductions in adjusted costs excluding transformation charges and bank levies.
We promised adjusted costs of EUR21.5 billion excluding transformation charges and the impact of the Global Prime Finance transfer to BNP Paribas, and we delivered.
In the second half of 2019, the first six months of our strategic transformation, we have grown Core Bank revenues, excluding specific items, slightly compared to the prior year period.
Revenues in the Corporate Bank were flat as we grew loans principally in Germany and performed well in Asia to offset the ongoing impact of negative interest rates.
And as we said in the Investor Deep Dive, we started to actively reprice deposits in the fourth quarter, which should begin to offset some of the impact of negative interest rates during 2020.
We grew revenues in the investment bank by 7% in the second half and by 22% in the fourth quarter with a strong recovery in fixed income.
We offset the headwinds from negative interest rates with growth in loan and investment product revenues, repricing and benefits of hiring in Wealth Management in prior periods.
Excluding transformation charges, which James will detail shortly, adjusted costs were EUR5.1 billion in the fourth quarter and EUR21.5 billion for the full year also excluding the costs associated with the Prime Finance platform.
In this respect, we feel even more confident after the fourth quarter.We ended the year with a core Tier one ratio of 13.6%, comfortably meeting our prior guidance.
Given our performance on capital in 2019, we believe we are in an even stronger position to execute against our capital plan we announced in July 2019, and we have created some room to allocate additional capital to growing our core businesses.More broadly, we have been managing our balance sheet conservatively and intend to keep doing so, as you can see on slide seven.
We are also encouraged by the performance in the investment bank at the start of the year and are focused on further stabilizing revenues.
On capital, we look ahead with increasing confidence given our solid core Tier one ratio in the fourth quarter of 2019.
And with 70% of the expected total transformation effects now behind us, we are satisfied with what our teams have accomplished in this short time frame.With that, let me hand over to James.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Christian.
In the fourth quarter, revenues adjusted for specific items shown on slide 30 declined by 1%, reflecting the wind down of noncore businesses in the Capital Release Unit.
Tangible book value per share was EUR23.41, a 4% decline from the third quarter, mainly reflecting the net loss in the period.For the full year, we generated a pre-tax loss of EUR2.6 billion including EUR1.1 billion of transformation-related charges, EUR1 billion of goodwill impairment as well as EUR805 million in restructuring and severance and EUR473 million of litigation charges.
Operating leverage was positive in the quarter as we reduced adjusted costs excluding transformation charges by 2%.
We reaffirm our leverage ratio target of 4.5% this year, excluding the Prime Finance platform to be transferred, rising to around 5% for 2022.Turning now to our businesses starting with the Corporate Bank on slide 16.
Excluding specific revenue items and approximately EUR800 million of goodwill impairments, transformation charges and restructuring and severance which are detailed by business on slide 29 of the appendix, the Corporate Bank generated a pre-tax profit of EUR939 million in 2019 with a post-tax return on tangible equity of 7%.
However, the performance in the fourth quarter and full year was impacted by our strategic transformation, lower levels of episodic items and changes to cost allocations in addition to the challenging interest rate environment.
Adjusted costs, excluding transformation charges, increased materially in both the fourth quarter and the full year.
Adjusted costs, excluding transformation charges, declined in both the quarter and the full year.
Excluding specific revenue items and approximately EUR430 million of restructuring and severance and transformation charges, the Investment Bank generated a pre-tax profit of EUR863 million in 2019, with a post-tax return on tangible equity of 2%.Consistent with our strategy to invest in our core franchises, we grew loans by 16% in 2019.
The Private Bank continued to execute on its strategic priorities in the fourth quarter and full year, with revenues excluding specific items broadly stable and reductions in adjusted costs excluding transformation charges.
Excluding specific revenue items and approximately EUR900 million of restructuring and severance, goodwill and transformation charges, the Private Bank generated a pre-tax profit of EUR524 million in 2019 with a 3% post-tax return on tangible equity.Revenues in the fourth quarter and the full year were impacted by the negative interest rate headwinds, partly offset by growth in loans and assets under management and the benefits of repricing efforts.
Excluding transformation charges, we reduced adjusted costs by 5% in the quarter and 4% in the full year, including the EUR200 million in German merger cost synergies we had previously indicated.
Revenues in the Private Bank declined by 4% on a reported basis or 2% excluding specific items, as you can see on slide 21.
First, as described, to build on the momentum we have generated over the past two years and deliver on our 2020 adjusted cost target of EUR19.5 billion excluding transformation charges and the impact of the Prime Finance transfer.
Everything else that happens this year, whether it's deleveraging in the Capital Release Unit, some degree of losses from restructurings, earnings in the Core Bank and investments in balance sheet growth in the Core Bank, all of that nets out against that 13%.How big a buffer we carry against the 12.5% minimum, we're going to have to see based on both the timing of all of these events as well as, frankly, the market opportunities for the businesses to grow balance sheet to support client activity.
But we're obviously very cognizant that the market is looking for us to maintain a healthy buffer to the 12.5%.On the Corporate Bank, again, Christian will want to add, but as he mentioned, there are a lot of moving parts in that revenue line.
But we would argue that the underlying trends are just as they were in the third quarter with a little bit more transient pressure on interest rates given Central Bank actions in the second half; that, of course, will now work to offset given repricing, tiering and all the other items that we also described to you.
James all laid it out exactly to the point.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerAndy, I'm reminded -- sorry for the long answer, but you asked about the investment cycle in Corporate Bank, and I think this is also an important area to describe to you.
And as for the Corporate Bank, as I just lined out, there are other initiatives not only the active repricing where we have very constructive discussions with our clients and where we think we will see the first positive impact from the repricing in 2020, but also there, we have the underlying growth in the other business segments being the growth in Asia in Trade Finance and so on.
But by and large, you should focus on that EUR15 billion number that we gave you for reg inflation on the RWA line for 2020.Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive OfficerOn the costs on the Corporate Bank, we have seen higher adjusted costs mainly from higher technology costs and control costs, also changes in the way we have charged the internal services to the businesses.
How do you think about that as well?Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive OfficerLet me potentially start with my view on the Investment Bank, and then for the returns question, I hand over to James.
So last but not least, from a market share point of view, now let's wait, I think, for all the institutions coming out with the numbers for the fourth quarter including all Europeans.
But if you -- to answer your question, I think the core bank numbers excluding transformation charges is probably the best number to look at.
The way we've presented the transformation charges is intended -- and also by the way, the BNP Paribas transaction, which includes leverage and expenses is intended to give you a sense of all the things that then fall away by 2022, making 2022 pretty much a clean year barring small restructuring expense and obviously the net loss, if you like, or the loss mostly from expenses that remains in CRU that we want to lift from that point.
Outperformance against our group capital ratio targets was principally driven by asset reductions in the capital release unit where we overachieved against our external targets, thanks to good momentum toward the end of the quarter.Let me now go a little deeper into our 2019 performance on slide three.
Reflecting the improved performance in the fourth quarter, we held Core Bank revenues flat in 2019 and grew pre-tax profit by 7% excluding certain specific revenue and cost items which James will detail shortly.
Asset Management continued its recovery with revenues up 12% in the second half reflecting higher performance fees in certain core funds.
Outperformance on the core Tier one ratio largely reflects stronger-than-anticipated risk-weighted asset reductions in the Capital Release Unit.
Our net loss in the fourth quarter was a little under EUR1.5 billion including approximately EUR400 million of transformation-related deferred tax asset valuation adjustments.
Provision for credit losses was EUR723 million in line with our expectations; and at 17 basis points of loans, remained relatively low.
Our net loss of EUR5.3 billion included EUR2.8 billion of transformation-related deferred tax asset valuation adjustments also in line with our expectations.
In the fourth quarter, we reduced adjusted costs by around EUR380 million or 7% year-on-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and the transformation charges I described earlier.Adjusted costs included EUR102 million of expenses incurred in the fourth quarter associated with the Prime Finance platform being transferred to BNP Paribas, which are reimbursable from December 2019 onwards.
We increased our CET1 ratio by 24 basis points in the quarter to 13.6% as we more than offset the transformation effects with derisking in the Capital Release Unit.Reductions in risk-weighted assets generated 73 basis points of capital on an exchange rate-neutral basis, including approximately 41 basis points from the CRU and approximately 20 basis points from lower market risk in our Core Bank.
Excluding these items like credit recoveries and certain smaller one-off gains which we've discussed with you in previous calls, Corporate Bank revenues were broadly flat as we grew volumes and fee income to offset the impact of lower net interest income principally in cash management.For the full year too, revenues were broadly flat.
Within Global Transaction Banking, cash management revenues declined, reflecting the impact of the negative interest rate environment with very limited benefits of tiering or repricing in the period.
Trade Finance revenues were essentially flat in the quarter but up 6% for the full year as lending and trade flows grew strongly in Asia and Germany.Securities Services revenues declined, reflecting our exit from equities trading and lower episodic items.
Revenues in Fixed Income Sales & Trading were EUR1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, a 31% year-on-year increase on a reported basis, or 34%, excluding specific items as shown on slide 19.
In Emerging Markets, our structured businesses continued to perform well, with a significantly improved performance in Flow Trading compared to the prior year.Origination & Advisory revenues declined by 12% year-on-year relative to a strong prior year period.
Provision for credit losses was broadly stable in the full year and at 15 basis points of loans reflects the conservative nature of our portfolios and strong underwriting standards.
Revenues in Germany declined by 7% primarily reflecting higher funding and liquidity related costs as well as lower contributions from asset sale transactions.
Excluding restructuring and severance and transformation charges, asset management pre-tax profit of EUR539 million increased by 31% year-on-year despite higher noncontrolling interests following the IPO in the first quarter of 2018.
Assets Under Management were EUR768 billion at quarter end, up by EUR103 billion or 16% during the year.The growth in AUM was driven both by market performance and four consecutive quarters of net inflows.
As a result of the strong revenue performance and cost discipline, Asset Management generated significant positive operating leverage with a six percentage point improvement in the full year cost/income ratio to 73% on a segment basis.
Management fees grew by 6% year-on-year reflecting the strong market conditions and consecutive quarters of net inflows which more than offset the impact of margin compression.
Leverage exposure declined by EUR50 billion in the quarter mainly driven by reductions in equities.Before I close, a few words on our 2020 financial targets on slide 26.
And third, to raise our fully loaded leverage ratio to 4.5% excluding the balances we hold for BNP Paribas and Prime Finance, principally reflecting the further deleveraging by the Capital Release Unit Consistent with our previous guidance, we expect provisions for credit losses to increase to around 20 basis points of loans in 2020 reflecting a continued normalization of credit and lower recoveries.
Looking further ahead, the progress toward our short-term financial objectives gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2022 targets, including a post-tax return on tangible equity of 8%.With that, let me hand back to James, and we look forward to your questions.James Rivett -- Head of Investor RelationsStuart, let's now open the lines for questions.Questions and Answers:Operator[Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Andy Stimpson of Bank of America.
I'm just wondering what the moving parts are from here and whether there was a bit more seasonality in the risk-weighted assets this quarter that you'd expect to come back in the first quarter or why or if there's more inflation or why not think that you could be above that 12.7% trough level during 2020.
And we are confident that we will show satisfactory results and revenues going forward.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerOn the EUR19.5 billion cost target, I would just say many, many things need to continue to happen across the organization as we continue on our cost discipline and this sort of run rate decline that we have exhibited for the past eight quarters.
",32.4,0.71977717
36,deutschebank,q1,2020,"Absolutely not, but with the right strategy, scale and leading franchises globally, a relentless focus on execution, strong balance sheet and with Germany as our home market we believe that Deutsche Bank can strengthen its competitive position in these difficult times.
Core Bank pre-tax profit grew by 32% year-on-year to EUR1.1 billion, excluding specific revenue items, restructuring and severance and transformation charges.
The team continue to actively reprice deposits in the first quarter and this puts us on a good track to pass-through negative interest rates to EUR25 billion of deposits in 2020 as part of our 2022 targets.The Investment Bank grew revenues by 15% with revenues up in both Fixed Income and Origination & Advisory.
We increased market share in our European and German franchise to the highest level since 2017.In the Private Bank, revenues increased by 3%, this growth was supported by the strong performance in Wealth Management, where strategic hiring in prior periods has started to pay off, again consistent with what we told you in December.
In Asset Management, growth in management fees was offset by interest rate driven changes in the fair value of certain guaranteed funds, despite the market conditions at the end of the quarter DWS has continued to grow assets in core areas, most notably through strategic partnerships and ESG funds.
The Corporate Bank also made progress on its strategic initiatives and benefited from reorganization measures implemented last year with particular focus on efficiency optimization in Germany and across infrastructure functions.In the Investment Bank, cost declined by 15% in part driven by the front office headcount reductions implemented in 2019, as well as lower internal service cost allocations.
As we made clear in our release on Sunday night, it is our deliberate decision and Deutsche Bank's priority to standby its clients without compromising on capital strength.We kept our liquidity position strong at EUR205 billion comfortably above regulatory requirements, while providing an additional EUR25 billion in loans to our clients.
In this regard, we are uniquely positioned to provide clients access to the services they need in a timely and efficient way.Since mid-March the Investment Bank has helped corporate and government clients, raise EUR150 billion of debt to fund their financing needs.
This positions us well to meet a temporary increase in client demand for balance sheet commitments over the next few quarters.As Germany's leading international bank, we also believe we operate from a solid macroeconomic and political backdrop.
Our capital includes a net EUR400 million of incremental prudent valuation deductions, reflecting increased pricing dispersion and wider spreads, driven by the market volatility in the latter part of the quarter.COVID-19 driven increases in risk-weighted assets of EUR7 billion, included higher credit risk RWA, due to ratings migrations and EUR5 billion from drawdowns on credit facilities.
The drawdowns on credit facilities also reduced our liquidity reserves by EUR17 billion and were primarily in our corporate relationship lending portfolio and leverage debt capital markets.
We would also expect for credit risk RWA to return to more normal levels as clients replaced drawn facilities with cheaper long-term funding.Turning to provisions for credit losses on Slide 12.
As I just mentioned roughly half of the provisions relate to COVID-19 impacts, principally against Stage 1 and Stage 2 performing loans, most of the increase was driven by updates to macroeconomic variables, changes in credit ratings in segments particularly impacted by the crisis, as well as higher drawdowns.
Excluding Central Bank cash for leverage exposure, consistent with the European Commission's proposal published yesterday would, if implemented, increase our leverage ratio by approximately 20 basis points.Turning now to liquidity on Slide 15.
Liquidity reserves declined by EUR17 billion in the quarter, reflecting drawdowns on committed credit facilities.
In the remaining three quarters of this year we expect to take an incremental EUR800 million of pre-tax charges, including EUR200 million of accelerated software amortization, which is not relevant for capital purposes.The progress we are making on our transformation agenda is increasingly visible in our cost performance as shown on Slide 17.
We made progress in all major cost categories, compensation and benefits expenses fell in line with the reductions in internal workforce; IT costs declined reflecting the lower amortization given the impairments taken in 2019, while our cash IT spend was broadly stable and within our target range as we continue our investment program.
Other cost declined, reflecting reductions across a number of areas; including occupancy.With that let us turn to our segments, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 19.
The Corporate Bank made further progress on it's strategic priorities this quarter, including continued progress on deposit pricing measures to offset the challenging interest rate environment.
Provisions for credit losses were EUR106 million for the quarter and mainly related to a few single name events, as well as the updated macroeconomic environment.
Securities Services revenues declined, reflecting the non-recurrence of a one-time gain in the prior year period, while Trust and Agency Services decreased as a result of US interest rate cuts and lower client activity.
Revenues in Fixed Income Sales & Trading increased by 16% year-on-year, excluding specific items, as shown on Slide 22.Strong performance in rates, FX and emerging markets offset the exceptionally challenging market conditions at the end of the quarter in credit.
The Private Bank reported a pre-tax profit of EUR132 million in the quarter, excluding specific revenue items, restructuring and severance, as well as transformation charges, pre-tax was EUR197 million with an adjusted post-tax return on tangible equity of 5% excluding bank levies.
The Private Bank continued to execute on its strategic transformation, consistent with our strategy we continue to grow loans and fee income to offset the ongoing headwinds from negative interest rates.Our new business generation continued in the quarter as we grew net new client loans by EUR2 billion and generated net inflows of EUR4 billion into investment products.
In the first quarter, we grew fee income from investment products, reflecting the success of targeted product initiatives and grew loans by EUR2 billion, notably in mortgages.PCB International revenues increased by 3%, higher loan and investment product revenues combined with repricing measures more than offset interest rate headwinds and the initial impacts of the COVID-19 related slowdown in client activity, mainly in Italy and Spain, we grew revenues in wealth management by 17%, excluding workout activities.
As you say it's temporary, I'm not sure it changes necessarily our strategic thinking about the balance sheet, but certainly it helps us report higher ratios and maybe look at the use of the leverage balance sheet a little bit differently, but obviously only over the temporary period.
We're obviously alive to the comparison, but we think again, looking at our detailed modeling, they're very good reasons to see this as quite different in terms of likely outcome relative to that stress test.Jernej Omahen -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystCan I just maybe just ask one follow-on.
So I was just wondering, let's assume that you're wrong, and the credit loss is not 45, but it's closer to EBAs estimate of 80, what are those dynamic actions that the bank can take to offset this event?James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, let me again just let me again start with the comparison.
So maybe you could just expand on that?And the second question is just around the restructuring and severance charge this quarter, which I think was EUR88 million.
And hence, I think we have good handling on this EUR51 billion portfolio in total.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd, one just thing to add to what Christian said.
And actually thinking about what can we implement now long-term and that will also result in cost reductions, and that combined with the track record this Management Board has build makes us confident to achieve the 19.5% or even be better than that.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerSo -- and I'll take the question about reserving.
We have not let the recent turbulence distract us and we have continued to execute in a disciplined manner against our cost targets.As a result we reduced adjusted costs excluding transformation charges and bank levies for the ninth quarter in a row on a year-on-year basis.
Adjusted grew pre-tax profit increased as lower costs and higher Core Bank revenues offset the higher provisions for credit losses and the drag from the Capital Release Unit.In the Core Bank, the combination of revenue growth and lower costs generated significant positive operating leverage in the quarter.
Excluding transformation charges and bank levies, adjusted costs declined by 7% year-on-year to EUR4.9 billion, our ninth quarter in a row of reductions.
The progress we have made in the first quarter and the projects under way put us on a good path to achieve or outperform our EUR19.5 billion target for 2020.Turning now to the Core Bank starting on Slide 4.
And in our German and International businesses, we have continued to grow loans and volumes to broadly offset the ongoing interest rate headwinds, this includes the conversion of deposits into investment products with the EUR4 billion net inflow in the quarter.
We are the leading retail bank with 19 million customers and the leading retail asset manager.We also believe that Germany is relatively well positioned, thanks to the strong and decisive actions of the government, the German support programs of around EUR730 billion amounting to around 22% of total GDP at the highest of any major country.
In the first quarter revenues were flat year-on-year with growth in the Core Bank offsetting the wind down of non-core businesses in the Capital Release Unit.
Non-interest expenses of EUR5.6 billion, included EUR503 million of bank levies in the quarter, as well as approximately EUR190 million of restructuring and severance, litigation and transformation charges.On a reported basis, the Group generated positive operating leverage of 5%.
Provision for credit losses increased to EUR506 million or the equivalent of 44 basis points of loans on an annualized basis.
Our results in the quarter were impacted both by our ongoing actions to implement our transformation, as well as the initial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most material of which we detail starting on Slide 11.In the first quarter, our provisions for credit losses included approximately EUR260 million of incremental charges, which I will discuss shortly.
Our forecasts were based on consensus estimates at the end of March, updating the assumptions to the current market views would have increased our provisions for credit losses by approximately EUR100 million.
Including the provisions taken in the first quarter, we ended the period with EUR4.9 billion of total allowances for credit losses.
In line with our stated strategy, we also continue to fund our business growth, which consumed roughly 10 basis points of capital in the quarter.
Our leverage ratio was 4% at quarter end, a decline of 21 basis points, principally from the COVID-19 related effects.
And our excess liquidity and stable sources of funding provide us with a solid foundation as we look forward.As Christian has said, we continued our strategic transformation in the first quarter, as you can see on Slide 16, results in the quarter included EUR177 million of transformation effects, including EUR4 million of transformation-related charges, which form part of our definition of adjusted costs.
Pre-tax profit of the Corporate Bank was EUR132 million in the quarter, excluding transformation charges and restructuring and severance, which we detailed by business on Slide 34 of the appendix.
At the end of the first quarter, we had charging agreements in place for approximately EUR40 billion of deposits, and are well on track to the targets we set at the Investor Deep Dive in December.Non-interest expenses increased year-on-year, in part reflecting higher transformation charges.
Adjusted costs excluding transformation charges also increased, mainly reflecting the change in internal service cost allocations that we discussed with you in the second half of last year.
Risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure increased in the quarter, mainly reflecting client drawdowns on credit facilities.Turning to the Corporate Bank revenue performance by business on Slide 20.
Revenues of EUR2.3 billion grew by 15% year-on-year, excluding specific items, driven by strong market conditions early in the quarter, as well as further growth in our client franchises.
Provision for credit losses of EUR243 million or the equivalent of 111 basis points of loans increased in the quarter, driven by the deteriorating market outlook.
Across rates FX and emerging markets, revenues were also supported by the benefits of our refocused strategy that we laid out in December with continued improvements in client engagement and strong growth in our institutional and corporate franchises.In credit revenues declined, reflecting the challenging market conditions in March, which were only partly offset by effective risk management and a strong performance at the start of the year.
Revenues in the Private Bank increased in the quarter, principally driven by a strong performance in Wealth Management, where we benefited from increased client activity and our relationship manager hires in prior periods.Non-interest expenses increased by 5% year-on-year, reflecting higher restructuring charges as we implement our cost reduction programs.
Provisions for credit losses were EUR139 million or 24 basis points of loans, reflecting the normalization of provisions we have previously discussed.
Revenues of EUR2.2 billion increased by 2% on a reported basis and by 3% year-on-year, excluding specific items, as shown on Slide 24.Revenues in Germany declined by 1%, reflecting the higher funding and liquidity costs that we discussed with you last quarter.
Asset Management reported a pre-tax profit of EUR110 million in the quarter, an increase of 14% from the prior-year period, mainly driven by lower costs with revenues broadly flat.
By product net outflows in fixed income and passive in the quarter were partly offset by net inflows in cash, equity and alternatives.As shown on Slide 26, Asset Management revenues were broadly flat to last year as the growth in management fees was offset by the change in fair value of guarantees, driven by the low interest rate environment.
Over time as client demand normalizes and we execute on the deleveraging program in the Capital Release Unit, we believe that we will restore our glide path to a leverage ratio of around 5%.Third, on adjusted costs.
We've also updated our outlook statements in the earnings report to reflect our current expectations for revenues this year, both the Group and business line level.
And hence we simply can see clients are reengaging, reentering with us and that's our focus.And in this regard, I do believe with the basic understanding that I think the heat of the crisis, we will see, obviously in Q1 and Q2, but looking at the revenue development of the four -- first four months, I'm confident that we can achieve the goal, which we outlined before.
When I was at that point in time, in the credit risk management team, the average equity position, the average liquidity, which was on the balance sheet of the corporates is not comparable to the one we see right now.
There's been, as you saw in our disclosure Page 12, is very little that we would see as COVID-related Stage 3 provisions taken this quarter, which we think is entirely natural for the very short-time elapse between the onset of the crisis and the end of the quarter.To your question about the macro assumptions, we use consensus estimates in that, build those into our models.
Thank you.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, Stuart, I actually don't have the -- to hand the exact number of credit risk RWA increases that we see for the balance of the year.
",31.08,0.8247536
37,goldmansachs,q2,2018,"I'll walk you through our second quarter and first half results, then cover each of our businesses, and, of course, I'm happy to answer any questions.Second quarter net revenues were $9.4 billion.
While it's impossible to predict the future, we remain cautiously optimistic that many of the broader drivers underpinning the solid start to the year -- healthy economic growth, positive investor sentiment, and the emergence of new market trends -- can remain in place.Let's review individual business performance for the second quarter.
For the year-to-date, we ranked No. First half performance was a record, reflecting our strong client engagement and multiyear investment in the business.
Year-to-date, we rank No. Clarity from U.S. tax reform, a supportive economic backdrop, generally resilient equity evaluations, accessible financing, and the virtuous cycle of M&A in certain sectors are all supporting activity.Moving to Institutional Client Services, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter, down 19% compared to the first quarter, but up 17% versus the second quarter last year.
While performance declined from a solid first quarter, client engagement remained healthy and the overall backdrop remained constructive for our market-making franchises.FICC client execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the second quarter, down 19% versus the first quarter, but 45% higher than the second quarter of 2017.
We continue to monitor and manage our overall expense base, with an emphasis on paying for performance to attract and retain the best talent and spending to support our clients, while investing in technology and infrastructure to grow the firm for the future.
We reduced our year-to-date compensation to net revenues ratio to 39%, down 200 basis points from the first half of last year, reflecting our strong year-to-date revenue growth and our emphasis on profitability.Non-compensation expenses were $2.7 billion, up 6% versus the first quarter and up 24% versus a year ago.
As we look ahead, we currently expect non-compensation expenses for the second half of the year to be materially consistent with the first half.As we continue to build scale and platform businesses, there is a natural migration from compensation to non-compensation expenses over time.
The $5 billion repurchase plan remains within the range of expectations we laid out in April and we will resume buybacks this quarter.On the Stress Capital Buffer, it's important to recognize that, for several years, we have managed the firm's capital to a stressed concept.
Across each of our seven revenue initiatives, we are running ahead of plan and continue to make progress in each of our businesses.For example, in Investment Banking, we're hiring new bankers and expanding and enhancing our client coverage.
And, finally, we're making solid progress across a variety of lending initiatives, including expanding our customer base of Marcus borrowers and depositors, growing our lending to PWM clients, and continuing to prudently deploy capital through our institutional lending and financing business.Clients remain the center of everything we do.
The $625 million of net NII in the quarter reflects a $2.5 billion run rate and that is an outgrowth of growing the lending book.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystOkay, great.
I'm just curious if you could talk toward that.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, Glenn, in our business, we have a variety of ways of looking at it and our merchant bank.
From a disclosure standpoint, maybe in some of the newer businesses, whether it's on the lending side, is there more that maybe could be done or that you guys are looking into, either to maybe improve disclosure and transparency?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, Michael, we're leading and running the business for the long-term and we know the importance, obviously, of delivering revenue and earnings growth, hence the growth strategy that we outlined for the market, driving more recurring fee-based revenue, expanding products and services, and broadening the client base.
I just would love to get more color from you.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerThe comp to net revenue ratio, as you know, Christian, is the 39% is our best estimate at this point for the full year.
So in light of that evolving competitive landscape, what's Goldman's edge in building on Marcus here?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, Christian, as we outlined -- and this is the way that we are making all of our decisions as we build out this business, indeed as we launched ourselves into this business in the first place.
Sometimes these revenues are lumpy.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, we're certainly seeing all kinds of trends at play and you mentioned some of them.
Are you kind of suggesting to us in that commentary that you really don't want to go below a 12% ROE because, if we kept the 41, it would have been below that?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWe were not setting the comp ratio in that way at all, Betsy.
And can you give us just some perspectives on that?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, Brennan, I'm happy to note that you saw the increased disclosure and we're working on it.
We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of when you laid those out in some detail and I was wondering when might we expect a more fulsome discussion of kind of where you are in terms of meeting some of those objectives.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, sure.
There's many ways to comport these statements that the results of this year's test are more severe with the Fed's statement that capital levels are appropriate for the industry across the board.The last thing I'll mention is that, if the SCB is finalized, the relevant print would be DFAST 2019, not the one that we just saw.
And then just how we should think about that in terms of kind of broader consumer finance and wealth management growth, especially as you add more products to the offering.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, certainly -- actually, I was just talking to Adam Dell this morning and, if you walk into our building, you can see Clarity Money on the pillar and I absolutely, some time ago, downloaded it myself and use it.
What do you see that, over the next 3 to 5 years, as Marcus grows and as you grow your corporate loan book, what do you think that can reach as a percentage of revenue?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, we've certainly highlighted for you that we are emphasizing in our strategy not only expanding the client base and delivering more products and services to that expanded client base, but also revenue growth, earnings growth, more recurring, stable, fee-based revenues.
And I've got a second question on asset management as well.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, let's start with that first question on prime.
And then kind of what was the corporate lending growth quarter-on-quarter?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerSo it really is loan growth, very, very broad-based, and so if you look at our HFI loans receivable, they grew $3 billion on the quarter.
I mean, is that just a portfolio that you can walk away from at some point?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, we certainly look, as you know, at all of our businesses through a large number of metrics and the way that they're treated in CCAR is certainly one of the many metrics.
For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2017.I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, expenses, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, supplementary leverage ratio, and stress capital buffer.
Our first half revenue growth results from broad-based momentum across the firm, as all four of our business segments grew at a double-digit pace versus first half of 2017.Institutional Client Services increased 24%, reflecting a 32% rebound in FICC, where we continued to grow our client franchise and strengthened our market-making capabilities.
This quarter, our clients responded to a stronger U.S. dollar, weaker EM currencies, higher oil prices, and a divergence between U.S. investment grade and high-yield spreads.Despite the persistence of geopolitical and economic risks, the backdrop remains constructive, as our clients continue to seek our advice and market-making services.
Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2 billion, 14% higher than the first quarter, driven by robust growth in advisory and continued strong and stable performance in underwriting.Financial Advisory revenues were $804 million, up 37% relative to the first quarter, reflecting higher completed M&A volumes.
Results were our third highest on record and up 3% versus the first quarter, as strength in equity offerings offset lower debt underwriting.Equity underwriting net revenues of $489 million increased 19% percent to the highest level in three years, as our volume growth outpaced the industry.
Strength across all regions drove performance, including notable deals in Asia, such as Xiaomi's $4.7 billion IPO, which was the largest technology IPO since 2014.Debt underwriting net revenues were a robust $752 million, down 6% from last quarter.
1 in institutional leverage loans globally and Top 3 in high-yield.Our investment banking backlog increased significantly versus the first quarter to reach a record level, driven by M&A and underwriting.
Mortgages was relatively flat sequentially.Turning to Equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion, down 18% versus a strong first quarter, as equity market volumes and volatility declines.
Equities client execution net revenues of $691 million declined from the first quarter, which was our highest quarterly performance in three years.
Over the past three years, we have had a balanced franchise, with derivatives and cash each contributing roughly half of equities client execution revenues.Commissions and Fees net revenues of $763 million declined 7% on modestly lower market volumes across regions.
On a year-to-date basis, our equities I&L businesses generated $2.4 billion of net revenues, roughly 65% from corporate investments and 35% from real estate.Our global, private, and public equity portfolio remains well-diversified with over 1,000 different investments.
We continue to evaluate new product opportunities, including wealth management, credit cards, and others, with our criteria for launch predicated on our ability to address consumer needs, apply the core competencies of Goldman Sachs, and deliver attractive returns to shareholders.Moving to Investment Management, we produced record net revenues in the second quarter, driven by strong incentive fee realizations and solid contributions from both our asset management and PWM businesses.
Transaction revenues of $182 million declined 14%, driven primarily by lower PWM client activity.Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.5 trillion, up $15 billion over the first quarter, driven by $8 billion of long-term net inflows spread across all asset classes, $10 billion of liquidity product net inflows, offset by $3 billion of market depreciation.Now let me turn to expenses.
We will provide updates on our tax rate once we have final guidance from Treasury.Turning to balance sheet liquidity and capital, our global core liquid assets averaged $237 billion during the quarter, which we expect to decline as we deploy our balance sheet to meet client needs.
Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.8%, up 10 basis points versus the first quarter.On capital return, we paid $314 million in common stock dividends, which included a 7% increase this quarter to $0.80 per share.
We have also seen success year-to-date with corporate clients, supported by our expanded FICC and Investment Banking joint ventures.In ICS, we continue to gather feedback on our performance directly from our clients and from third parties, where indications continue to be positive, and our client volume market shares have improved.
By successfully implementing these initiatives, we expect to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth and enhance the durability of the firm's earning profile.In conclusion, when we think about our ability to drive value, we are encouraged by our roughly 15% returns year-to-date and the further benefit from our growth plans, giving us increased confidence in our ability to deliver attractive long-term returns for shareholders.
Please go ahead.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning, Mike.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystHi. My question relates to why isn't Lloyd Blankfien staying to the end of the year and what changes do you expect with David Solomon taking over the helm?
How much is that up?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerSo I'm not gonna break out the percentage change, other than to say it was strong growth on the quarter.
IS that a 2018 specific decline or should we be thinking about the longer term tax rate being lower as well?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, it is a 2018 story.
We mentioned $5 billion annual revenue in three years' time without the market opportunity set expanding.
Granted there's endpoint sensitivity to these types of analyses, but I'm just wondering, were there any particular things that might have held you back in the Equities business this quarter as we try to think about how we kind of annualize and go forward?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerI'll start by saying our Equities franchise, which I had the opportunity to co-head some number of years ago, is one that I wouldn't trade for anyone else's equity franchise.
Meaning what areas seem to be maybe hitting close to all cylinders and are there areas or regions where you just feel like there could be quite a bit of upside just to even get back to some type of baseline activity level?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, the way I would look at the first half of 2018 is it was great results and no question that we're pleased with them.
Please continue with any closing remarks.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerSince there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call.

38,goldmansachs,q3,2018,"During the third quarter while we saw quieter levels of client activity in certain businesses, several positive macro trends continued including healthy global economic growth particularly in the US, strong CEO confidence, open financing markets, rising equity market valuations, and stable credit spread.
While it's impossible to predict the future, we remain cautiously optimistic given active client dialogs, healthy economic growth, and resilient investor sentiment.Let's review individual business performance for the third quarter.
Equity underwriting net revenues of $432 million decreased 12% sequentially amid lower follow-on volumes, but more than doubled versus a year ago as IPO activity accelerated supported by strong activity in Asia.
We also ranked Number 1 in global IPOs. Debt underwriting net revenues were $632 million, down 16% from last quarter amid lower industry volumes.
Our Investment Banking backlog remains at robust levels, but decreased versus a record second quarter driven by M&A completions and underwriting.Our backlog still remains up significantly from a year ago.
Third quarter net revenues were $3.1 billion, down 13% sequentially, but roughly flat versus last year.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.3 billion, down 22% sequentially and 10% lower than a year ago driven primarily by low levels of volatility and client activity.
Equities client execution net revenues of $681 million were roughly flat sequentially and up 17% versus a year ago.
Performance was supported by strength in our derivatives businesses, partially offset by lower cash revenues from program and on exchange electronic trading.Commissions and fees of $674 million were down 12% sequentially, but roughly flat versus a year ago.
Security Services net revenues of $439 million were flat sequentially and rose 9% versus last year reflecting higher average client balances as we continue to invest to expand our footprint in the business.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.1 billion reflecting net gains from private investments, primarily driven by improved corporate performance.
On a year-to-date basis, our Equities I&L businesses generated $3.5 billion of net revenues, roughly 60% from corporate investments and 40% from real estate.Our global private and public equity portfolio consists of over 1,000 different investments and remains diversified across industry and geography and balanced across investment vintage.
Net revenues were down 8% sequentially driven by significantly lower incentive fees, but up 12% versus a year ago on higher management and other fees and incentive fees.
As we expand the firm and grow our businesses and we emphasize lending and also platforms, increasingly our focus is turning away from comp to net revenue ratio where -- which has historically been a topic on these calls, and really to efficiency ratio overall where we're looking at comp and non-comp expenses holistically with the focus on profitability.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI Institutional Equities -- AnalystFair, OK.
Just given what you guys have done to build out the Investing and Lending business and the makeup today, just how much will the public market volatility, maybe wider credit spreads impact it versus sort of the core lending growth and then maybe on the equity side like if GDP growth continues to be healthy?
So just imagine when you look at the strength of the Investment Banking business and you find us in Number 1 positions across a range of different products, imagine us extending that product set now to corporate cash management and other similar such businesses and I think the opportunity there is fairly extensive growth in areas that we have not played in before.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Thank you.Ms. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2017.I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, expenses, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, supplementary leverage ratio, and stress capital buffer.
Scherr -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Heather, and thanks to everyone on the call for joining us this morning, I'd like to make a few comments before I turn the call over to Marty to walk through our third quarter results.
We will do so by better leveraging our core competencies of advice, risk management, and technology solutions; and by encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship within the firm.Importantly, we remain committed to executing on the revenue growth opportunities we laid out for you about a year ago.
This is why, David, John, and I along with the rest of the leadership team will look for new ways to grow our businesses while improving our operating efficiency for the long term.
David will join our earnings call in January and is looking forward to being a participant in the quarters and years ahead.Finally, I would like to thank Marty for his many contributions to the firm as our CFO.
I'll now walk you through our third quarter and year-to-date results, then cover each of our businesses, and of course we'll be happy to answer any questions.Third quarter net revenues were $8.6 billion, net earnings were $2.5 billion, earnings per share was $6.28, return on common equity was 13.1%, and return on tangible common equity was 13.8%.
Our year-to-date revenue growth demonstrates solid progress across the firm as all four of our business segments grew at a double-digit pace.We grew our Institutional Client Services revenues by 16% or $1.5 billion, accounting for 40% of the year-to-date revenue improvement.
Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2 billion, down 3% versus the second quarter, but up 10% versus a year ago driven by a rebound in equity underwriting.
Turning to Equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, down 5% sequentially; but up 8% versus a year ago on better performance, higher US equity market volumes, and higher average volatility.
Results this quarter also included a provision for loan losses of $174 million, primarily related to loan growth.Our I&L assets included approximately $105 billion in loans, debt securities, and other assets and $21 billion in equity investments.
We posted net revenues of $1.7 billion in the third quarter driven by continued growth in our asset management and private wealth businesses.
We emphasize paying for performance to attract and retain the best talent and investment spending to support our clients while building technology, infrastructure, and platforms to grow the firm for the future.Compensation and benefits expense include salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior equity awards, and other items such as benefits.
Roughly 55% of the increase versus last year continued to be from expenses related to client activity and investments for growth, including approximately $425 million across Marcus, our consolidated investments, and technology; and approximately $190 million from higher brokerage, clearing, and exchange fees.
We have a strong capital position to both serve clients and invest for growth.Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts.
Our solid double-digit year-to-date revenue increase demonstrates the capabilities in each of our client businesses and we continue to work hard to grow further from here.
So as you noted, it's $160 million in revenue on the debt tender and the geography in our financial statement is approximately evenly split across FICC ICS, Equities ICS, and I&L.So, approximately evenly split across those three categories.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
And of course on the Equity I&L line for both private and public, it will be affected by market valuation levels, but the operating performance is really what's critical and we saw that driving the results in that segment this quarter.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein.
I guess if you could share just an update on the growth initiatives you guys outlined to expand the customer footprint and kind of where you are in the ability to pick up extra billion dollars of revenues over the next couple years?
Scherr -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerYes, the only thing I would add to that is I think that the speed and efficiency with which our ratios recovered over three quarters following year-end, I think speaks volumes about the agility of the business to adjust.
I simply want to point out that those are businesses where acquisitions are efficient, both as I said in the acquisitions of talent and IP and equally time to market, particularly in the consumer business where the opportunities may present themselves.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Martin Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerSo on your question on Marcus, I would say that it's important to recognize that there are a number of different components to Marcus that contribute to the 2020 objective, unsecured lending in the Marcus platform being one but equally the value of deposits in that franchise being another.
I guess the point I'm making is that when you look at the loan component that makes up a number of different inputs to that target, our ambition is not to stretch, stretch to the target, meaning we're not going to let that business sort of grow because the target is out there in terms of balance sheet if in fact the market and the environment is not hospitable to it.
And finally, I'd say and an example of this would be the nascent plans now around corporate cash management, which is I view us as having an extraordinary set of relationships with corporates to sort of look and build that business on a technology platform that will be rather edgy and I think our ability to capture it now is more real than it would have been years ago.
Scherr -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerI would only add to that that, as I said earlier, we need to run and guide the firm with customer and client centricity at its core and in doing that, of course, we're mindful of the potential for changing circumstances in capital rules and we need to be nimble in the context of how we adapt to them just as we were over the last three quarters to adapt to change occasion by tax.
Longer term, I think we should hold ourselves out to even greater efficiencies because platforms will become more mature, delivery of product across all of our businesses will be more efficiently delivered, and you'll start to see pickup at the top line by virtue of the investment in the growth initiatives themselves.
Please go ahead.Guy Moszkowski -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystThis question, I think, is going to build a little bit on some of the earlier comments that you've made on platforms and margins going forward, but I wanted to take a look at, for example, FICC which has struggled over the years and this quarter again has a significant revenue downturn.
Of course, the market structure is different, and these businesses will evolve differently and at different speeds, but the lessons we've learned of building tools, having a tool-driven culture, putting those tools in the hands of our people and clients, that's what's going to drive margin efficiency and scale.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
And so Marcus as a platform is not to be viewed as an island within the firm.I'd also say that we have opportunity by virtue of relationships that exist with corporates through investment banking, to take those relationships and look to develop partnerships with consumer-facing organizations.
And so I offer this out, not just to give you an indication of what the platform might look like, what the forward roadmap might be with respect to product, but equally to sort of let you in on the adjacencies and channels and opportunities that exist around Goldman Sachs that can serve in the growth of what we've tried to build with respect to consumers.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Scherr -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerI'd answer your question without limit to any particular division, meaning, if I look at investment banking, as part of the growth initiatives with the 2020 target, we set out to open offices in a number of different cities where we had not formerly been and to look to expand the client base because there is very attractive, accretive business to be had in and among those clients.
",26.82,0.7383702
39,goldmansachs,q4,2018,"We remain committed to delivering a full range of services to our clients, including advice, market liquidity, investment management and financing.As many of you know, John, Stephen and I are conducting a comprehensive front-to-back review across each of our businesses including three-year forward plans to identify opportunities, to strengthen or expand our client footprint and to operate more efficiently.
We are also actively engaged in pursuing opportunities to grow our addressable market by broadening client relationships and improving our mix of products, services, particularly to corporates.Specifically, as it relates to FICC, we are the leading institutional market making franchise.
Across these and other investments for growth, combined with a significant focus on operating efficiency, we are beginning to deliver on our commitment to enhance the durability of our revenues and our earnings.We continue to review our strategic priorities with our Board and plan to communicate a more comprehensive update to the market in the coming months.
Importantly, we are making significant investments to further expand our client franchise, ROE revenues and enhance the long-term earnings profile of the firm, the cost of which is being funded by the embedded operating leverage in our businesses.In summary, I'm extremely pleased with our performance.
The team I had assembled to execute on our priorities including John and Stephen have an increased sense of urgency and discipline to help move our business forward.With that, I'll turn the call over to Stephen who will walk us through the details of our financial performance.
For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7.9 billion, up 7% from 2017 on increases in both financial advisory and underwriting.For 2018, in addition to our leading advisory position, we held the number one position in equity underwriting globally.
For the full year, ICS generated $13.5 billion of net revenues, up 13% compared to 2017, driven by healthier volumes, better wallet share and improved execution in certain of our businesses notably in commodities.
Nevertheless, we continue to broaden our client and product footprint and deepen our relationships to drive higher rankings and market share.Second, we remained focused on leveraging our best-in-class investment banking relationships, to better serve corporate clients.
This is important as we are not relying on a market turn to yield better results, but are looking to expand our client footprint.Lastly, we remained focused on continued investments in engineering and electronification.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion in the quarter reflecting continued strong results in private equity investments.
The business remains well positioned for growth as we continued to invest in people and make bolt-on acquisitions to enhance our product offering to better serve our clients.Now let me turn to Page 12, for expenses.
This included an increase of $656 million in provisions related to litigation and regulatory proceedings, approximately $300 million of higher expenses relating to accounting changes due to the revenue recognition standard with substantially all of the remaining increase of $892 million from investments to drive growth and higher activity reflected in brokerage, clearing and exchange fees.Moving on to taxes, as mentioned earlier, our tax rate for 2018 was 16%.
We remain committed to serving and growing our global client franchise, building on the progress made in 2018 and further expanding our addressable market in 2019 and beyond.To achieve this, we're continuing to invest in our franchise, to broaden and improve our client capabilities through technology, talent, and by engaging in new disruptive activities.
The other half relates to general performance of the business and on that, as you could imagine, we deploy a number of different metrics in terms of how we arrive at valuation, but I think the important element to convey on that side is that there's a long history in the investing side particularly in equity in both sourcing, interesting and sometimes unique opportunities for businesses that demonstrate stability and growth trajectory and that performance feeds into the methodology we deploy against the private portfolio.
What we've identified that we think is a real opportunity given the scope and the magnitude of all the platforms over the firm, is to add some resources and broaden the plan to raise more money off the capital given the uniqueness of our platforms and the uniqueness of our sourcing capability and when you look at that opportunity and you compare what would be significant growth for us, compared to other people that are in that business, given our platform, our investing resources and our capability to manage money for institutional and individual clients, we have meaningful growth without setting overly ambitious targets.
So we are in the process of outlining that all in a much more clear way, there will be some hiring and additional resources that need to be added, but it's not a significant build because the fundamental investing platforms exist and is more opportunity to leverage that.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
And we think that's part of a more durable, more visible, more recurring set of revenue as part of the overall I&L picture itself.Michael Carrier -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch -- AnalystOkay, thanks, and then just as a follow-up -- just on the expense side, so obviously 2018 you had some moving pieces with some of the legal, but just when you think about some of the investments that you guys have been making in some of the new growth initiatives on the technology side, how should we be thinking about the run rate going into '19 and in '20 in an environment where obviously the market has been a bit more -- a bit more volatile more recently?Stephen M.
All of the investments span in the different projects that David and I have been talking about, whether that's in Marcus or whether that's corporate cash management or whether that's the building incremental platforms inside the securities and trading business is in that $892 million.As I've said, 2019 will be a continuation of the investment.
My view is that the rate of growth in that expense, while it will grow, the rate of growth will be less than the rate of growth that we saw in '18 and we're going to continue to look to deploy existing operating leverage in the business as a source of that investment spend in the business overall.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein.
If three to five years ago, we said on one of these calls, that in 2018, we would have a year where our FICC ICS revenues were less than $6 billion, we were making significant investments in building out a digital consumer platform and we happened to be in a situation where we had outsized litigation expense, that we would deliver $36.6 billion of revenues and a 13.3% return, people would have said not possible, and the reason that that's happened is we have been working for a number of years to broaden our business, expand our addressable wallet and at the same point in time increase the durability of our revenues and you can see from the slide that we put up at the beginning that over the last X number of years -- five years, we've moved from less than 50% more fee-based recurring revenues to over 60% today.We continue to be committed to that and as we're developing a plan to move forward, we see things we can do in the existing businesses and adjacent builds some of which we mentioned.
And it's against that addressable market that we're going to take and are taking in part of -- as part of the front-to-back of U.S. to -- the proper expense size against that wallet and against that TAM, the amount of debt and liquidity we need to put against that business, the amount of risk that we need to take on in the context of intermediating risk for clients and then ultimately the amount of capital to put against it.This is not something that David and I have just woken up to.
And I'm not hesitating other than part of the front-to-back review that we are engaged in right now, is to answer the very question you're asking, which is again, understand the addressable market including an expanded set of customers and clients that we will focus on and then being quite clear about what our take in that market can be and then the inputs to driving that business, whether it's expenses, liquidity, capital and otherwise.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure.Guy Moszkowski -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystFollow-up question is in a different direction and just follows up on the comments that you made about the 1MDB situation and the litigation reserve bill that you quantified.
One, being an internal reallocation based on growth but second, and in the growth sense, we want to invest in areas which will carry accretive returns for our shareholders, and that can grow, and so our ambition and our MO will be just around that.Matt O'Connor -- Deustche Bank -- AnalystAnd then maybe a question for David on the capital theme still, you're clearly reviewing the businesses, you're looking to make revenues more annuity like than they've been.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystSo I wanted to start off with a question on some of the efficiency commentary and I have to say I was quite encouraged by the remarks really from both of you Stephen and David on that focus driving efficiency, the higher accountability from the individual teams and one of the interesting things that's been a big focus from investors is when we benchmark your efficiency ratio against the peers and really focusing in on the businesses that are comparable, the efficiency ratio range for the peers that's about 55% to 70%.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer(Technical Difficulty) an example of that is in any lending business when you're in a growth mode, you continue to have reserve build right to the point at which you're at a comfortable steady state and from there you start to see the margin increase.And so I think that each of these businesses whether it's corporate cash management or Marcus are all in their early stages.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell, I would just point out, I think that this is going to cascade down in the organization, meaning our ambition is to put more of the cost in the direct control of the businesses so that they are owning the front-to-back.
I'm excited about our new call format and presentation, which is an initial step as we continue to enhance engagement and disclosure.As shown on Page 2, it is important to underscore that our overarching priority is to execute our core mission, serving our diverse client franchise which includes corporations and governments, institutions and individuals.
Starting with our market making business in FICC and Equities, we have spent a significant amount of time evaluating all aspects of our businesses including our delivery model with a focus on providing best-in-class client experience and execution.
We're running the business with a clear perspective of its revenue potential.Over the recent years, we've made significant progress on improving capital utilization and reallocated capital away from FICC commensurate with its potential in order to grow strategically important and higher returning businesses.
We are now six months into a two-year build and our firm will be first to use the cash management platform later in 2019.In addition to validating the product, clearing our own operational payment flows will reduce costs and operational risks.
The fourth quarter, particularly December, was characterized by a decline in investor sentiment with respect to the global growth outlook, a concern that central banks would continue to tighten into a slowing growth environment caused weakness in equity and credit markets, and resulted in an increase in volatility of many macro assets.While this has created challenges for many of our institutional investing clients, it is also driving potential future opportunities for active managers to add value.
Clients continue to need comprehensive asset wealth management advice and individuals need simple and transparent financial services that add value.Next, I'd like to take a moment to address the ongoing investigations related to matters with the Malaysian sovereign development fund 1MDB.
In the fourth quarter, the business produced net revenues of $2 billion, up 3% versus the third quarter as a significant pick up in M&A completions helped offset a decline in underwriting revenues as the difficult market backdrop slowed issuance volumes globally.
We also participated in announced transactions totaling nearly $1.3 trillion which included over $450 billion from transactions below $5 billion in deal value, reflecting progress in broadening our client coverage.Moving to Underwriting, market volatility, declining equity prices, and wider credit spreads, weighed on issuer sentiment as net revenues were down 21% sequentially in the fourth quarter to $843 million.
This strong performance reflects our continued focus on building long-term client relationships and our ongoing investment in talent and capabilities.
FICC client execution net revenues were $822 million in the fourth quarter, down 18% versus 2017, amid challenging market conditions particularly in credit and to a lesser extent in rates.
Equities' client execution net revenues were up significantly versus a challenged fourth quarter of 2017 with better performance in cash.
Commissions and fees were 9% higher attributable to increased client activity following the significant uptick in volatility, particularly in low touch where we continue to gain market share.Securities services net revenues decreased slightly reflecting lower average customer balances.
Our share of global equity market volumes increased by over 100 basis points versus 2017 and included growth across all regions reflecting a multi-year positive trend.
I would point out that before accounting for future growth, we begin 2019 with an annualized net interest income run rate of $3.2 billion.Our Debt Investing & Lending balance sheet as shown on the lower left of Page 10, ended the quarter at $113 billion, which includes $94 billion in loans and $11 billion in debt securities.
On a like-for-like basis, our compensation ratio declined approximately 100 basis points year-over-year.Fourth quarter other operating expenses were $3.3 billion, which as I mentioned earlier, included litigation expense of $516 million as well as a donation of $132 million to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund.
Solomon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay, so I'm going to start, Christian, by making a couple of comments and then Stephen will go into, I think, a little bit more detail on some of the specifics that you mentioned.
But we're not confused by the fact that the available wallet in market intermediation for large institutions has materially declined over the course of the last five years.One of the things that's been interesting for me over the last two years once I became President and I started spending more time with a broader diverse array of our clients and I'd always go out for the last decade more than a decade and see investment banking clients and they always told me how extraordinary they thought our people were, the way our teams work together, the way they executed.
And I think in the process de-risk the firm from that perspective.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystAnd when you think about how you get paid for this business, I mean historically in the industry part of it has come from lending, so I just wanted to confirm that that's part of how you're expecting to get paid but also how you think about capital allocation to the loan book not only in corporate but in consumer, that a while back there was some commentary that you know maybe Marcus loan growth would be slowing, so maybe you could touch on that and also how you think about the balance sheet utilization toward loans versus toward buybacks?Stephen M.
So I think if you look historically from this time that we acquired the GE deposit platform in the U.S. Appreciate that.And then my second question, while we've seen spreads snap back and the loan market recover here, CLOs and levered loans became a big topic in the fourth quarter.
Just one follow up as relates to some of your comments on the marginal margin improving and I know it was a little bit more than a year ago when you initially laid out those growth targets on the revenue side of $5 billion.
I think it's largely been viewed as kind of a net cost cutting capital reduction exercise but you, on the other side of that, do you have any early reads on kind of what specific existing businesses look like they might deserve more investment or more capital than maybe you previously realized and just so that we know is this going to come with first quarter results or when should we expect this?David M.
Solomon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystCan you guys share with us and I apologize if you already addressed this but what impact do you think the MiFID changes has had on your equity business.
",13.62,0.5395423
40,goldmansachs,q1,2019,"First, we aim to grow and strengthen our existing businesses, second; we aim to diversify our business mix with new services to expand our opportunity set and increase the durability of our revenues; and third, we aim to operate more efficiently and effectively across all aspects, including expenses, financing and capital.To achieve these objectives, we will endeavor to deliver One Goldman Sachs to our clients.
Our new investments will generate results over time, and will be complementary to our long-standing core business, which we will continue to strengthen.Ultimately, we believe this strategy will allow us to serve more clients with differentiated products and services, increase the durability and predictability of our earnings profile, deliver improved profitability, optimize our capital, and deliver higher long-term returns for shareholders.With that, I'll turn the call over to Stephen to give you some additional details and walk through the results in each of our businesses.Stephen M.
As we go forward, we expect significant increases in client utilization, which carries the potential to generate revenue across a more engaged client base.As I mentioned, we are spending a significant amount of time on FICC, with a focus on growing revenues across each of our core businesses.
Today across both the US and UK, we have $46 billion of online retail deposits, leaving a tremendous opportunity for growth, and we will design our deposit platforms to capture our share.Pivoting to Investment Management, we continue to grow assets under supervision in key strategic areas, including advisory, outsourced CIO and ETFs, as well as in our world-class ultra-high net worth business, where we have modest share in a very fragmented market.
We currently have over $170 billion in alternative assets under supervision and plan to significantly increase fundraising in the months and years ahead.As we have said before, we are building Marcus, as a fully integrated digital business, as a broad multi-product platform, wealth management will be a key component.
Over time, as I mentioned earlier, we will seek to reduce the capital intensity of this business, by managing more client assets in fund form and reducing our balance sheet investments.On platforms, we are actively pursuing a number of work streams to digitize manual activities, expand straight through processing and reduce cost per trade.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerLook, I think, based on reserves that we have taken over the past several quarters, we feel confident that those reserves are proper and adequate.
The strategic M&A stuff is much more long cycle, and I don't think it's really been that significantly disrupted and the activity levels would certainly show that.In terms of market activity and client engagement, we saw significant pickup in the second half of the quarter.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerMichael, the only thing I'd add to David's comments is that, I think in Equities, we are seeing and saw over the quarter, month-by-month increases in prime balances, which speaks to an increasing level of activity.
I think when you look at investments that are being made over the course of '19 and 20, we have a view as we're now developing three-year models, as to when we will see, or begin to see efficiency play through.You'll see that in the context of cost per trade, you'll see that in the context of platforms that take lift, which carry with them higher marginal margin and less intensity in terms of expenses being put to it beyond the investment horizon.
I'd also say as it relates to the deposits, that over time you will start to see us build greater functionality around the deposit platform such that we are ultimately less reliable, or less reliant if you will on price, as the key sort of element.Right now the firm is a better incremental buyer of retail deposits and the numbers that we're suggesting a sort of rules of thumb about how inside the funding cost of wholesale these deposits come, are largely predicated on where we currently are in terms of price, but we'll be able to lower beta as and to the extent we put on greater functionality, greater stickiness, greater privity with those depositors.
But this is a conservative estimate in the context of, I think, what we're capable of growing and for that matter, whether there won't be other jurisdictions that we eventually look at.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
And hopefully you feel that today's presentation is another example of this.But we also recognize that as we do this, we want to get it right, we want to be clear, we want to make sure the people in our organization can put it forward with respect to their businesses, where the kinds of investments we're making over multiple years or things that we can really stand behind, as we work toward targets, which is something that we haven't done before.
In fact, as David said, we're going to engage in a very regular cadence and you're seeing it already, obviously, in the context of the presentation that we're putting in front of you.And in the interim period, performance targets will be on the offing, and we will review, whether financial disclosure needs to change in the context of the changing shape and profile of our business, and our organizational structure.
And so I think all of that will sort of put us in a place, where we have a cleaner, more forward-looking lens through which we and you can look at our business and whether that takes the form of at an Investor Day or some other form for a comprehensive update, we'll engage in that.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
And so that's the general direction of traffic for the consumer business, but I think it reflects more broadly on the overall firm as David laid out in the presentation.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
And so the take-up of deposit account openings, off of those that use clarity money is principally higher than what we had expected and what you might see in the industry.Equally, in the context in the category of delivering the firm in consumer, make no mistake that bringing together Marcus with our Investment Management division had a strategic component to it, which was, we were business that for many, many years, obviously managed funds and managed assets for high net worth individuals.
And unfortunately, I'm just not in a position to give you more clarity on what I think that timing looks like.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
And this is changing, the way in which we look at overall trade flow from the beginning, through to the middle in the context of collateral management, through to settlement, the place of operations in that chain now matters more than it's ever mattered in the past, in the context of our engagement, and the question of customer satisfaction and client satisfaction with the business.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell, as I said at the start, over the course of the next several months, we're going to take a long hard look at ways in which we can enhance disclosure.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo, we will over time look to give you greater insight into the overall spend and the cost of spend in the disclosure that will give you.
And I think that the margin that we will see on that lending will only improve to the extent that we further diversify, as we have laid out as a strategic priority, the overall funding mix of the firm.And so as and to the extent that we engage in this lending through the bank, we can avail ourselves of lower cost funding provided by retail deposits, which are obviously growing, as I've mentioned now several times in the call.
These elements are critical to our key growth platforms, including Marcus and Mass Affluent Wealth, where we will pursue partnerships to access large numbers of consumers, Marquee our digital institutional platform with the ability to innovate can help us engage at scale with our institutional client base.
These improvements will take some time to realize, but should ultimately create significant operating leverage for the firm and long-term value for shareholders.Turning to Page Seven; let me be more specific in terms of the initiatives in both our existing and growth businesses.
Lastly, these efforts will help us better serve corporate clients across the firm, including an adjacent areas like ICS and Investment Management.Next, in our Institutional Client Services business.
We have already taken many of these actions and expect to continue to make refinements over time.In credit, where synergies with Investment Banking facilitate our high rankings in both trading and underwriting, we are building models and tools to facilitate faster inventory turnover and reduce drawdown risk, as we execute client flows.
We are vertically integrating 7500 operations and engineering professionals directly into the business, to enhance the client experience and provide greater expense accountability to our business leaders.We're also making a number of changes to reduce costs and drive long-term operating leverage, by increasing use of shared platforms across our business, and migrating more of our efforts to locations, like Bengaluru, Warsaw, Dallas and Salt Lake City.
Based on last year's results, for every 100 basis points in efficiency ratio reduction we achieved, it equates to approximately $300 million of net income and a 40 basis point increase in ROE, all else equal.Before moving to discuss the quarter, let me turn to Page Nine, where we layout a road map for what to expect in the coming quarters in terms of performance targets, financial disclosure and a broader discussion of the strategic way forward for Goldman Sachs.
Let's run through the numbers.Turning to Page 11, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.8 billion, down 11% versus a solid fourth quarter and flat versus a year-ago, as very strong advisory performance offset a sharp decline in underwriting.
During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions of approximately $390 billion and closed on nearly $370 billion of deal volume, ranking number one in global completed M&A.Client dialogues remained healthy and we are seeing increased activity in sectors including financials, TMT, natural resources and healthcare.
In the first quarter, we ranked first globally in equity underwriting with $16 billion of deal volume across nearly 75 transactions,.Debt underwriting net revenues were $652 million, down 18% from a year-ago.
We are optimistic that a number of significant technology companies are expected to come to market later this year.Moving to Institutional Client Services on Page 12.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.8 billion in the first quarter, more than doubling fourth quarter levels, reflecting a better operating environment.
We saw higher sequential performance across all five of our global fixed income businesses, as markets reversed the sharp December risk-off moves.FICC revenues however, declined 11% versus the first quarter of 2018, amid lower client activity.
Results were impacted by significantly lower performance in derivatives, given lower market volatility versus the first quarter of 2018, when volatility was elevated and client activity was robust.Commissions and fees net revenues were $714 million, driven by lower client volumes versus both last quarter and versus a year-ago.
Security services net revenues of $370 million, fell by 14% year-over-year, amid lower average client balances, as hedge funds deleverage, though balances have been recovering.Moving to Investing and Lending on Page 14.
As I had commented on the last earnings call, this seeming inconsistency is because our portfolio skews more to private securities then public holdings, as shown on the slide, and there were less event-driven valuation remarks of our private equity holdings.Our global equity portfolio was $22 billion, at quarter-end and remains well diversified with roughly 1,000 different investments.
Our firmwide net charge-off ratio remained low at 50 basis points.On Page 16, turning to Investment Management, we produced one $1.6 billion of revenues in the first quarter, driven by our diversified Global Asset Management business and leading PWM franchise.Net revenues included management and other fees of $1.3 billion, which were largely in line versus the fourth quarter.
Overall revenues declined versus a year-ago due to significantly lower incentive fees and lower transaction revenues from PWM client trading activity.Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.6 trillion, up $57 billion versus the fourth quarter, driven by $20 billion of long-term net inflows in fixed income strategies and $59 billion of market appreciation, that being partially offset by $22 billion of liquidity product outflows.Now let me turn to expenses on Page 17.
For the quarter, our efficiency ratio was approximately 67%, up 100 basis points versus a year-ago, largely driven by lower revenues.Next on taxes; our reported tax rate for the quarter was 17.2%.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Steven Joseph Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystI wanted to start off with a question on the I&L strategy, so you outlined efforts to increase fee-based recurring revenues and reduce the volatility in that principal investment line.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- AnalystAnd how we might expect that to improve going forward, as you continue to, to raise customer deposits, let's assume that, asset yields stay flat going forward, just for the sake of argument, if you continue to raise customer deposits, how can we expect that $35 million to increase over coming quarters?Stephen M.
",16.97,0.550902
41,goldmansachs,q2,2019,"For the year-to-date, total expenses were $12 billion, down 6% year-over-year.Our year-to-date efficiency ratio was 65.6%, up 100 basis points versus a year ago, driven by lower revenues and ongoing investments, partially offset by lower compensation expense.
Also as we have noted in the past, as we grow more scale and platform-driven businesses, it is our expectation that compensation will decline, as a proportion of total operating expenses and the efficiency ratio will become a more relevant measure for the firm.
While we continue to assess capital return in the context of the market environment and opportunities for accretive investment in our business, consistent with our long-held strategy, we are encouraged by the increased flexibility afforded by our strong capital position.We enjoy the option of returning a significant portion of our earnings to shareholders over the coming year.
To the extent, we have excess, after these investments, we will endeavor to return it to shareholders.Second, with respect to dividends versus buybacks, we aspire to having a higher dividend long term, as it's an important component of total shareholder return and it's further reflective of the firm's confidence in our ability to generate more recurring and predictable sources of revenue.
We have spent a lot of time thinking about it because when you look at these businesses, which in the past, I did organized over multiple parts of the firm, we're now internally reorganizing and bringing them together.
And so over time, we will provide more transparency to you on the assets that currently exist in all four of these channels, which are significant and to our aspirations over time to increase the amount of third-party capital that we manage in these different asset classes.With respect to the balance and operating is, as I said to the previous question, we have been doing this for 30 years.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThe one other point I'll add to respond to your question is that, as David rightly points out, this will be a transition.
And it's also worth noting that different sleeves, whether it's credit, real estate, with respect to, for example, equity carry different capital density and the opportunity to realize higher returns on the balance sheet deployed will be there.
Meaning, as stewards of capital, we are looking at and for opportunities where we can invest in an accretive way to generate long-term shareholder return.
And I think what played out in the context of CCAR is a reflection of what we are comfortable with in terms of what we're going to look to put out, given where the market and circumstances are.On the question you raised about FICC, the focus for FICC, not born of this quarter in particular, but since we came on and started to look and reunderwrite the business, it's been around capital efficiency and equally cost in the context of delivering in to our clients.
And so that continues to be a focus of ours in terms of the franchise.When you look at FICC in particular, I would say that the business is focused on clients in the context of expanding out the corporates, transaction banking and the like.
Just given some of the investments and then the longer term, the focus on the efficiency ratio, just wanted to get an update or run through some of the initiatives that are in place and the progress you guys are making to lower the cost base over time and improve the efficiency ratio.Stephen M.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell, I think part of the calculus is the direction of travel, right, of where these regulations are, what the final SCB ruling looks like.
Meaning, what's happening on platforms that are introduced, that underpin incumbent businesses that are not looking for, if you will, new flows to come on, but we're transacting with clients in a different manner and form than what we've done in the past.Just one really small example.
Now, we're able to provide a platform where the client can engage and look to conform and develop a portfolio on a much more efficient basis -- cost efficient basis than would have happened in the past.So, I think there are sooner efficiency, or I should say efficiency to be realized sooner in the context of platforms underpinning incumbent businesses, there'll be a longer timeframe as you note in the context of realizing efficiency in some of the newer initiatives that we're building.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Now that's, again, a lot of assumptions, but it's based on the information that's out there on lower rates for the credit quality versus peers, what peers are charging and no fee.And I -- that another of my question is, how are you thinking about consumer lending?
But this is a risk business, and we'll continue to look at it as we grow it out on a risk-adjusted return basis.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystSo, on a -- really a follow-up has to do with the expected at-scale efficiency that you think you're going to be running these businesses at, when they're at scale.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think, I would encourage you to follow up, sort of with -- for an answer that's more precise than what I can give you now.
We reported second quarter 2019 revenues of $9.5 billion, down slightly versus last year, but nonetheless, reflecting solid franchise performance amid a mixed operating environment.
Our business performed well and remain solidly positioned for future growth.In Investment Banking, we ranked number one in global announced and completed M&A, and number one in global equity underwritings year-to-date.
Our equity market making business delivered its second highest quarter in four years, and our franchise continues to generate broad-based market share gains across regions.
We produced the highest quarterly I&L revenues in eight years, aided by significant gains from our private equity investment -- investing activities, reflecting our ability to source opportunities for the firm and our clients, and record net interest income in debt I&L, which annualizes to $3.5 billion.
Importantly, our clients' long-term needs for advice, financing and access to markets endure across cycles.Switching gears, I'd like to provide some insights on two important strategic decisions we made in the second quarter and our alternatives and wealth management businesses.
This will be a transition, and we are mindful in protecting the revenue potential of these businesses as we grow third-party assets.Second, we announced plans to acquire United Capital, a registered investment advisor with approximately $25 billion in assets under supervision, 220 advisors and 90 offices around the country.
United Capital represents a key step forward toward our long-term strategic goal of providing comprehensive wealth management services to individuals across the wealth spectrum.Upon closing the transaction today, United Capital will become a powerful complement to our Ayco business, our leading financial executive counseling and investment advisory business, it serves many of the largest corporations in the United States.
On a combined basis, Ayco and United Capital will serve clients with over $80 billion of assets under supervision, representing a strong base from which to grow our mass affluent wealth franchise.It remains ambitious -- it remains our ambition to continue to serve ultra high net worth individuals through our long-standing PWM business, individuals with $1 million to $5 million of investable assets to Ayco and the broader mass affluent segment through a hybrid of digital and human engagement as an extension of markets over time.Before turning the call over to Stephen, I would like to spend a moment on the recent Federal Reserve stress test results released in late June, which showed bank's ability to withstand over $400 billion of stress losses.
This change reflects the Board and Management's view that dividend growth is a critical component to delivering strong shareholder returns and reflects our progress over recent years, increasing more durable fee-based revenues to support the higher dividend.Lastly, I would like to briefly touch on our strategic communication plan over the coming quarters.
Financial Advisory revenues of $776 million were down 3% versus last year.During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions of approximately $465 billion and closed on $235 billion of deal volume, contributing to our number one M&A league table rankings year-to-date.
Our deal flows in this quarter were consistent with trends across the industry, which reflected materially lower volumes in the loan market and lower activity in acquisition-related financings, particularly with financial sponsors.Nonetheless, our franchise remains well positioned, with our high-yield league table rank rising to the number two spot year-to-date, further reflecting our competitive strength.
And while markets can change quickly, we are optimistic that our clients will remain active in executing strategic transactions in the coming quarters, given healthy levels of client dialog and continued needs to access financing markets.Moving to Institutional Client Services on page five.
Net revenues were solid at $3.5 billion in the second quarter, down 3% versus last year as our diversified business experienced low client activity in FICC, offset by strength in equities.FICC client execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the second quarter, down 13% year-over-year, reflecting both the mixed operating environment and generally lower client activity despite notable strength in Europe.
Specifically, we saw lower volumes in our macro businesses, amid low volatility and shifting client sentiment.Relative to last year, client activity in rates and currencies, including emerging markets was more subdued, as trade and tariff concerns, more than economic data drove sentiment and constrained client engagement.
We saw lower structured finance client activity versus a year ago, while flows in credit came alongside from a more muted origination backdrop, particularly in investment grade debt and leverage loans as I had mentioned earlier.Separately, mortgage revenues increased amid better performance.
We believe our success reflects our continuing consolidation of global market share and a dedication to serving clients across a full suite of cash, derivatives, and prime services, in both high-touch and low touch channels.Equities client execution net revenues of $772 million increased 13% relative to the first quarter and were up 12% versus a year ago.
We also continue to grow market share in low-touch execution.Security services net revenues of $458 million, rose 24% sequentially and 5% year-over-year.
Second quarter results were up 20% versus a year ago, primarily reflecting higher net gains from public equities.As you can see on the slide, approximately 25% of our net revenues were from real estate and 75% were from our corporate investments.
We produced $1.6 billion of revenues in the second quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading private wealth franchise.
Net revenues included management and other fees of $1.4 billion, which were up 5% versus the first quarter and up 4% versus last year, reflecting continued growth in assets under supervision.By contrast, we generated significantly lower incentive fees relative to the outsized $316 million last year.
We also saw lower transaction revenues from PWM client trading activity.Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.7 trillion, up $61 billion versus the first quarter, driven by $17 billion of long-term net inflows, $12 billion of liquidity inflows, and $32 billion of market appreciation.Now, let me turn to expenses on page 10.
Investment spending will continue into 2020, when we will also see a more meaningful impact of the reserve build supporting our initial growth in the Apple Card portfolio, following our expected launch later this summer.Year-to-date, the total pre-tax cost from Marcus, Apple Card, and our new transaction banking platform is approximately $275 million, resulting in a drag of roughly 60 basis points on our ROE.
While our second quarter performance was solid despite the mixed operating environment, we believe, as David said, the overall economic growth backdrop should remain supportive of our business.
And we're starting to see some early progress in that, I would say in this quarter, in particular within Europe.I'd also say that as part of an effort to expand out and penetrate further the corporate base around FX and rates, we're seeing some benefit come to us, by way of the joint venture between banking and FICC, where banking obviously owns an entry point into the corporates and the ability to carry through those products into the corporate franchise where we have a demonstrably strong set of relationships, I think will bear dividend.What's more, I would say that if you look at a variety of different initiatives and builds, including transaction banking or corporate cash management, this one's built, will carry the potential to bring forward a more captive FX business that didn't exist inside the firm.
But our treasury team is working hard, both in terms of the amount of liquidity we run with, how that liquidity is managed in addition to identifying more efficient lower cost funding sources in order to render these businesses more competitive.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Devin Ryan -- JMP Securities -- AnalystFirst question just on United Capital with the deal closing, just look to maybe get a little more perspective on how you're thinking about the business opportunity, I guess broadly.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystIn your comments on the debt underwriting, you mentioned deal flows in the quarter were consistent with the trends across the industry, which reflected material lower volumes in the loan market in M&A activity area.
",20.93,0.43791863
42,google,q1,2020,"Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas maybe considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Third, I'll talk about our business, especially our advertising business, which was significantly impacted in the last few weeks of the quarter, and I'll close with our investment plans and focus for the rest of the year.In the early days of the crisis, we were able to put in motion a number of efforts quickly.
With respect to the implications of the global crisis for Google Cloud, we're proud of the accelerated traction we achieved across sectors including public sector and healthcare for disease monitoring and control, working with leading retailers on demand forecasting, working with companies across media and communications to enhance their customer service, and across industries on supply chain optimization.In the first quarter, other revenues were $4.4 billion, up 23% year-over-year primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues and Play.
In terms of Google Cloud, we remain very pleased with the execution by the team reflected in the ongoing pace of customer adoption of both GCP industry specific solutions and G Suite collaboration tools to help businesses operate efficiently and effectively.Moving on to profitability, while TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of items in other cost of revenues that are generally less variable in nature such as depreciation and operations costs of our technical infrastructure as well as for activities like customer support and content review.
We now anticipate a deceleration in headcount growth that should start to be visible in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter.Although we are focused on these and other steps to moderate the overall pace of investment, we remain committed to the long-term opportunities for which we are well positioned.
Obviously, we've had great success with Search and so we are bringing a lot of those learnings and we're sharing it with our customers and so we expect to see more traction there over time.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd on your second question, I like the way you framed it.
So across everything we do, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Play, be it Cloud, I think we are investing to capitalize on this long-term opportunity and I would say overall on Alphabet as well, when you look at investments like Waymo and Wing, you can imagine, in the future these things working well can play a significant role and and even in the limited areas Wing is in, we clearly saw its potential through a moment like this.
I think that the way I would answer that is after a decade of growth, there have to be opportunities for added efficiency and we've been focused on that for some time, but painful times like this put a spotlight on an urgency around making sure you're focused on the levers that you have and hopefully those instill the right kinds of health metrics etc against what you're managing.So I would say that the intent most certainly is that these are durable investments to ensure that we're operating as effectively and efficiently as we can be and I just need to reiterate, and Sundar and I have both said this, we remain committed to investing for the long-term.
First, I wanted to thank you for the color around the growth you're seeing as you were exiting the quarter in the ad business and there's been some signs from different partners or different companies that ad spending while still down considerably has actually improved a little bit, maybe some green shoots from the declines that you might have been referencing at the end of March.Any chance you can give us a sense of the type of growth you've been seeing for the first kind of three, four weeks of the quarter, just kind of just to help level set us and then, just in regards to the provision you mentioned in G&A related to credit deterioration, is there a chance you could tell us the amount of that provision and do you expect to have to do this again in the second quarter?
So by the end of March, total YouTube ads revenue growth had decelerated to year-on-year growth rate in the high-single digits.And then for the second quarter so far, I think it's premature to gauge given uncertainty in the environment and a few weeks, obviously, is not a quarter.
Thanks.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerIn terms of overall priorities, I would say we've always taken a long-term view through -- on thinking through the arc of where things are going and our deep focus on AI is an example of that and we've been convinced for a while that those trends will play out in the long-term.
So we continue to focus, anywhere we think the actual work we are doing is based on deep technology, deep computing, deep computational scale is the kind of investments we think still stand the test of time through things like that.Beyond that, we are actively looking at how user patterns are emerging.
So for example, e-commerce is an area and you saw us respond through this with the changes we announced on our shopping property and going for comprehensiveness there and with new leaders in place, we're going to be making sure we work on the user experience there and so we are looking at shifts be it video conferencing with Google Meet and G Suite and adapting and investing in those areas as well.
So that's how we're approaching it.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of the geographic breakdown for YouTube, we haven't broken that down although I think as you know well, we have a breakdown for the major regions around the world and to give you a little more color there, in mid-February, revenue growth across the business began to decelerate in APAC, although as I noted, the decline in APAC was more muted just given the uneven impact of COVID and the nature of our business across the region and then the impact in EMEA was first evident in mid-February with a steeper fall off in March and in the second week of March, we then saw results in the U.S. as well as other Americas fall off shortly, but nothing more specific by product.Michael Nathanson -- MoffettNathanson -- AnalystThank you, Ruth.OperatorThank you.
Maybe talk to us about as you sort of look back over the last couple of years at what you've done on the SMB side and what are sort of one or two of the key hurdles where you see you really need to invest and build more comprehensive SMB products for post recovery?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerMaybe I can give color both on the SMB and a bit on the ad side too.
I earlier talked about, you can imagine, if you're a customer and you have data centers, these are fixed costs when you go through moments like this and so people are really looking at opportunities there and so our teams are super engaged, but I do want to acknowledge maybe -- small businesses across the world are deeply impacted.
As a company, we've announced several efforts to support small and medium businesses and we are going to be deeply engaged with them, but I think it's a tough journey we are all on and we look forward to working with them to help them through this.OperatorThank you.
Could you explain a little bit more about the reasons for making those changes and expanding the free listings or creating the free listings and what drove you to make that decision now?And then a related follow up for Ruth, same question essentially, but as we think about the financial impact of such a change, imagine this is one of those things, which may qualify as causing maybe some variability in the quarter-to-quarter rate, but something that benefits all parties over the long-term, I think is how we've often visited these sorts of changes, but any color you could add on sort of the near and long-term impact of the Google Shopping changes would be great too?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerSo, going through a moment like this, it's very clear, you know, part of what makes Google work well is people come across a diverse range of needs and that's true for shopping.
We've been executing well over there for the past year and the growth on Google Pay has been strong and so being able to bring all of that together along with strong players like PayPal etc will help us give great experience for our users here.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd in terms of your question about the financial implications of the effort, there's really not much to add here today I would just say, reecho Sundar's comment works, excited to have Bill leading the effort, and as Sundar said at the outset, one of the priorities is creating sustainable financial value and we have a leader who has a demonstrated track record of doing that.
On direct response, I do think, I think people are -- it's a journey and people who have been investing are seeing that it is cost effective, and so, over time more people are looking at it.Our sales teams are doing an excellent job of helping our customers understand the opportunities there and so being able to bring all of that to bear.
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo as I tried to be really clear in my response to Heather's question, I would not extrapolate from my comments for the full quarter.
We have seen that the most pressing concern of small and large businesses right now is business continuity, solving for issues like employee safety, dramatic falls or surges in demand, supply chains, and managing a remote workforce.
Google Cloud is forming deep partnerships such as with leading healthcare provider, HCA Healthcare, to understand data around ICU bed availability, ventilator supplies, and test results and you may have read about our exposure notification partnership with Apple designed specifically and carefully to protect users privacy while helping public health authorities and governments manage countries reopening.Second, we are working hard to provide accurate and authoritative information to people using our services.
G Suite is helping Netflix and German manufacturer, Kaeser Compressors, transition quickly to remote work while Twitter, Shopify, retailer Schnucks, and Italian bank, Credem are using Meet for things like all hands and customer meetings.Elsewhere across the business, YouTube subscriptions continued to grow.
We'll be optimizing the way our data centers work and prioritizing strategic areas of investment where we need to support our users and partners.Let me express my thanks to our employees for their herculean efforts under these difficult circumstances.
Our results for the first quarter are a tale of two quarters with strong results across our revenue lines for January and February followed by an abrupt decline in March in our advertising revenues as governments globally instituted stay-at-home orders in response to COVID-19.
At the same time, even through March, our non-advertising revenue lines maintained their strong performance particularly Google Cloud.
In terms of the foreign exchange impact, exchange rate movements resulted in a modest headwind to reported revenues.Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC was $19 billion, up 19% year-on-year.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.5 billion, up 26% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses.
The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation and then content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube's advertising supported content followed by content costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube Music and Premium subscription services.
We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $117 billion.Let me now turn to our segment financial results starting with our Google segment.
Your line is now open.Doug Anmuth -- J.P. Morgan -- AnalystGreat, thanks for taking the questions.
People who may have been hesitant to shift their budgets are looking through moments like this and trying to get all that working better.Cloud is an obvious area.
Your line is now open.Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystGreat, thank you so much for taking the question.
",19.85,0.72310364
43,google,q3,2017,"Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor.Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth, and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.6 billion, up 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically: costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and hardware-related costs.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $5.5 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 32% year-over-year.The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
A couple of updates.Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with a number of notable launches, including the Nest Thermostat E, which is offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat.
As in prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers.In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in Cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we placed on this business.
The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites.
Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with a number of notable launches, including the Nest Thermostat E, which is offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat.Nest also announced a home security solution that includes the Nest Secure alarm system, Nest Hello video doorbell, the Nest Cam IQ outdoor security camera and corresponding software and services.
I frequently highlight our culture of innovation.In that regard, the most important point is that we are data-driven with an extraordinary team of engineers, product managers and designers who constantly challenge assumptions and run thousands of experiments annually to enhance user and advertiser experiences.
We continue to remain focused on long-term dollar growth versus margins.The pressure in our total cost of revenues reflects our product mix shift with a number of our higher-growth businesses also carrying higher cost of revenues.
It's been particularly exciting to see our early bet on artificial intelligence pay off and go from a research project to something that can solve new problems for 1 billion people a day.Even though we are in the early days of AI, we are already rethinking how to build products around machine learning.
I'm really pleased with the way our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome, have continued to grow, enabling great experiences for people all over the world and powering devices for more than 1,000 brands worldwide.
We are moving away from First Click Free to a more flexible model of content sampling, and we are working with publishers to build a frictionless payment solution for subscriptions that can help them grow revenues and find new readers.
And our advertising platforms continue to drive greater sales for our partners.While mobile has given rise to an unprecedented amount of data and complexity for advertisers, we think that machine learning will help it make -- will help make it easier for advertisers to reach consumers.
During the quarter, more than 1 million small businesses used it to build websites, helping many of them get online for the first time.We also introduced local posts, which allows small business owners to easily post their latest updates like upcoming events, special offers, and new arrivals right on Google Search and Maps.
And to help millions of people, we are building products specifically designed for local markets in Asia.In India last month, we launched Tez, a mobile payments and commerce app that already has more than 7.5 million users who have made more than 30 million transactions.
Wanted to understand better your ambitions in e-commerce as a marketplace or a platform and how that might also feedback into the advertising business.Second question will be about the cash on the balance sheet and sort of how philosophically you think about deploying that cash against either shareholder returns or some of the big opportunities you laid out today.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerMaybe I'll take the 1st question given to are up on the cash question.
And the approach continues to be productive, especially because the line of inquiry evolves as user behavior evolves.And so what users wanted in the earlier days of smartphones when screens were smaller is obviously very different from expectations users have today.
A little bit on growing Alphabet's multi-app ecosystem.Sundar, how do you think about the strategic importance to drive Chrome and Google Assistant app into dollars and user growth on non-Android mobile platforms?
Do you mind if you could share about early findings on the rollout of YouTube TV?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. Main thing I would say is the consumer feedback, I think there's always been this promise on being able to -- just like today on Google Search when you want something, we make it so easy for you to find it.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn emerging markets, we do see differentiated opportunity there, partly because the characteristics of how truly many of these markets became mobile first, I think, gives rise to different ways users are adopting our products.
We also benefited from substantial growth in other revenues from Cloud, Play, and hardware.Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $19.7 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $19.7 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
Network revenues were $4.3 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $3.4 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, Play, and hardware.Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
Further, our culture of innovation is building our nonadvertising revenue streams in Cloud, Play, and hardware.Earlier this month, for example, we launched our expanded line of hardware products, bringing the best AI software and hardware together and building on the first-generation of Made by Google products we introduced last year.
In our advertising businesses, TAC continues to increase as our highest growth areas, mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Third, as to CapEx, we continue to invest to support business momentum, including increased compute power from machine learning, which is an asset across Alphabet, as well as to support cloud, search and YouTube growth.In conclusion, a great quarter.
So you know it, you know, so this a lot more to come.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo in terms of your second question, there was really no change from the approach we've talked about previously as we think about capital allocation.
As you said in your question, we have a host of really exciting opportunities, and ensuring that we're investing to support long-term growth remains number one.
And then the third is the return of capital, and no change or update there in terms of how I think about that.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorThank you.
So I think overall, that's creating a good virtuous cycle, and I'm looking forward to having more momentum there.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd on your TAC question.
And I think the main point is we're very pleased with our strong partnerships across the mobile ecosystem.And the other was the ongoing shift to mobile, which we've talked about a lot, and the fact that it carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.
Thanks.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo it -- so like, a number of calls talked about the fact that there was no one item that was driving the momentum we saw in our sites revenue.
We are really pleased with the momentum in the business, excited about the opportunities we have given the ongoing strong underlying secular trend, but wanted to give you more color on what do we mean by a culture of innovation.
And I guess, in particular, how do you think about maintaining Google's lead as the way we search changes and as we see increasing adoption of these voice-enabled digital assistants in the home?
And people also see the room ahead, thanks to our lead in machine learning.And that's an area where I think we'll continue to drive advantage.
So we are driving it forward in a way in which we know it's going to give strong both revenue and earnings growth.
You have made large and exciting investment and growth opportunities across Google and Other Bets.
If we're doing that well, we're delivering long-term revenue and earnings growth.And those investments need to be seeded early for them to continue to grow and flourish around the globe, whether that response to the first question on what's going on in APAC or across Alphabet more broadly.
So it just made a lot of sense to do it.And I would also think about the overall capability we are getting, not just to make phones, but as we get into other product categories like Google Home, VR and so on, right?
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo in terms of TAC, as I indicated, we've got a couple of things going on.
So Sundar, can you talk about how Google's positioning in the emerging markets over the longer term can be different versus what we are used to seeing here in the States?
But again, I feel really pleased with the progress, momentum that we're seeing in the various businesses.And I guess, the only other thing to notice of is seasonality on the hardware as we move into the fourth quarter here.Stephen Ju -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystThank you.OperatorThank you and that concludes our question and answer session for today.

44,google,q3,2018,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Our revenues in the third quarter continued to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud, and desktop search resulting in consolidated revenues of $33.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency.
The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing headcount primarily for Cloud and ads followed by advertising investments in Cloud, Chromebooks for the back to school season, and the Google Assistant.
Other revenues for Google were $4.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year fuelled by Cloud and Play.We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
In terms of headcount, growth was seasonally higher in the third quarter because we brought on new graduates.We are continuing to invest in adding talent to our priority areas, particularly for technical roles in engineering and product management and to support our most sizable growth areas, in particular Cloud.
We have adapted many of our core products like Search Maps and YouTube to work well for the next generation of users coming online.We are also building products to meet the specific needs of users in the region like Tez, a digital payments app for India to help people easily pay their electrician or split it in a bill with just a few taps.
Referencing the blog post and some of the changes about how you see the future of search, I wanted to know what some of the key investments you think the company needs to make so that search becomes more visual or relevant and what that might mean tying it back to the business for engagement with your products, relevancy of over the medium to long term.
And Philip and Prabhakar, with them I think it's in great hands and I expect a lot of continuity there.On your question on search and Discover, it's -- in addition to making search more visual, one of the things we are very, very focused on is not always do users turn to us and actually ask a question.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn hardware, we always want to be at the forefront of computing and so -- and lot of times that involves thinking across the whole stack, bringing together the entire experience in an integrated way for our users.
And beyond that, we're looking at how the market adoption is and we are thoughtfully building a business, but we are committed to building and investing for the long run.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd in terms of how we're thinking about planning, we're in the middle of it now and many of the questions sort of been already asked sort of point to the direction that we feel really good about the underlying strength in the ads business as we've talked about on numerous calls.
And some of the comments that Sundar made about the opportunities that open up with visual search again continue to point the direction direct response, continue to point to some of the underlying areas in which we're focused.But as we've talked about on prior calls, that's one element of it and we continue to invest for opportunities that are sizable over the long term.
Sundar has already commented on both hardware and cloud as really important examples and we think the steps that we're taking, the investments we're making provide the foundational support for ongoing long-term sustained growth.
So, we are constantly looking for ways by which we can better serve Chinese users and that's where we are today.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of Waymo, in the third quarter, as I think you know, we extended our Early Rider Program to a larger group and we moved into very early days of commercialization.
Could you just talk a little about how you think about the gaming opportunity for Alphabet and what you think are the key factors you need to tackle to really build and scale direct-to-consumer facing cloud gaming product.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerLook, on the ad stuff, we've had ad formats in Maps for some time and we are constantly working to make it more useful and relevant.
On your second question, look, we today serve our users on gaming across Google ads in many ways, right.
And so it's early to say, but we are focused on doing the right thing there.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of technical infrastructure and our CapEx, as we talked about last quarter, CapEx reflects our view of the growing opportunity set in our core ads and search businesses as well as the longer-term opportunities in newer businesses in particular to support cloud.
So, we're really proud of what the teams are doing around the globe.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn your second question, one of the things we clearly see when we make a hardware product like Pixel in which all the tools and the utilities we build are conveniently there integrated and the experience is great.
So when we think about the big opportunity, where is the most natural fit to drive Verily going forward?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn Pixel, look, first of all, part of the big thing is this is our third generation of hardware.
Look, overall I mean it's now we've been doing this seriously at the next level for three years and we are definitely seeing strong indicators that are the investment in product is clearly beginning to work.
Could you just talk to the European business and what you're seeing there?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerLook, I mean specifically, I think if your question is around GDPR and so on, first of all, I mean we've always been as a company very, very focused on user privacy and security.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerLook, I mean I think on the first thing on e-commerce, maybe really people, we do see a lot of activity in the vertical on our products and we see strong growth there as well.
So, we are continuing to invest there and we are also driving strong partnerships with the retail sector both in terms of our shopping experiences as well as through cloud and I think that continues to be a big opportunity.And on your broader question, look, the reason we are investing across Google and Alphabet in a set of areas is because as a company over the past 20 years, we have developed deep capabilities in technology, in computer science, and especially with machine learning and AI.
The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, which continued to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses and content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube.Operating expenses were $11.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year.
As discussed in the previous two quarters, both operating income and OI&E are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments.
Our effective tax rate was 8.8% for the third quarter reflecting discrete items, notably an adjustment associated with the US Tax Act. Net income was $9.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $13.06.Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow.
Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 23% year over year.Operating income was $9.5 billion, up 11% versus last year and the operating margin was 28.2%.Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.6 billion reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction, and facilities.
This includes a number of data center construction projects in-flight as well as ongoing expansion in our compute capacity.I will now turn the call over to Sundar.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Ruth.
Last month we kicked off 20 years of Google Search by introducing some of the biggest updates in many years.They include a new AI powered ranking approach that delivers more relevant results, a redesigned Google Feed called Discover to help you stay informed on topics that matter to you, and a new search experience for Google Images.
Every day people from all over the world turn to YouTube to learn something new from career skills to coding to cooking.Just this week we announced a $20 million investment to expand our YouTube learning initiative, which will help fund established in emerging educational careers.
YouTube's ads business continues to provide great results for marketers and creators.
In apps we announced a partnership with Unity Technologies, which gives our advertisers access to one of the largest global networks of mobile gaming titles across 1.5 billion devices.
Google Drive became the eighth Google product with 1 billion monthly active users and Gmail now has more than 1.5 billion monthly active users.One of our big wins in the quarter was Fast Retailing, the Japanese retailer best known for its popular brand UNIQLO, which is migrating its employees globally to G Suite, while also pursuing AI solutions like on-demand forecasting on Google Cloud platform.
Our cloud business is benefiting from our investments in technical infrastructure including a US-Europe cable that will improve speed for millions of people.
Just one year since it launched, over 30 million people and businesses across India now use the app every month and they've collectively made more than 1 billion transactions.
Not only do these investments in data centers, machines, and offices allow us to provide great services to users; they have a strong positive impact on the communities around them supporting thousands of jobs and countless local businesses.
Your line is now open.Eric Sheridan -- UBS Securities -- AnalystThanks for taking my question.
And then with respect to your comments on YouTube, we're starting to hear from advertisers that there is some blurring between brand and direct response ad budgets as they look at products maybe more across blended lines.
Our ads leadership comes -- Prabhakar who has taken over our ads product and engineering efforts, is someone I worked with for many, many years and most recently has led our G Suite business, but has done many roles before, is a deep computer scientist.
We continue to invest here because we see ongoing opportunities in particular as we leverage machine learning to provide better experience for users and for advertisers.
Your line is now open.Douglas Anmuth -- JP Morgan -- AnalystThanks for taking the questions.
Sundar, can you help us better understand how the remedy in Europe will work in terms of licenses and TAC going forward and what impact do you see that having on financials?
So as you guys roll out more products like Lens and Gboard, and some of these other utilities on top of your billion-plus apps like Search and YouTube, is there any way to parse out what the overall engagement looks like in markets like the US and Western Europe when the phones are improving their functionality and you keep adding these additional utilities?
As you look out two or three years, do you think any of these businesses could really make a financial positive difference on the bottom line for overall Google?
",36.7,0.80946946
45,google,q4,2018,"We had a strong 2018 with total revenues of $136.8 billion, up 23% over 2017, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing investments to deliver exceptional experiences for users and compelling returns for our advertisers, partners, and enterprise customers.
For the fourth quarter, revenues of $39.3 billion were up 22% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency as we continue to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud, and desktop search.
In terms of dollar growth, results were led, again, by mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search.Network revenues were $5.6 billion, up 12% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and Google Ad Manager.
Machine-learning is also driving differentiation for newer Google businesses like cloud and hardware as well as central to a number of other bets, most notably, Waymo and Verily.
Because we make changes with a focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long term, the timing of the introduction of new experiences, particularly in search advertising can vary which can result in an impact on quarterly year-on-year growth.Second, during 2018, the FX tailwinds in the first half of the year turned to headwinds in the third and fourth quarters in line with the strengthening of the US dollar.
In addition to our progress in AI, we saw great traction across newer areas like the Google Assistant, hardware, and Cloud.And our core areas such as Search, Maps, News, YouTube, and our computing and advertising platforms continue their strong momentum.
This is an important long-term investment that lay the groundwork for our future computing needs, primarily to accelerate machine-learning across our businesses but also to support the opportunities we see in Cloud, Search, Ads, and YouTube.
And we see a lot of opportunity here.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of revenue and investments in YouTube, overall, as Sundar said, YouTube is continuing to benefit from the secular change in the way users are consuming content.
In terms of the expenses, I think what you're referring to is within other cost revenues, the primary driver in the fourth quarter was the increase in content acquisition costs due to YouTube growth.
And that's both for ad-supported content in what is, typically, a seasonally strong quarter and also, for our newer subscription businesses which do have higher TAC as a percentage of revenue, we're excited about the growth we're seeing here.OperatorThank you.
Thank you so much.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, in terms of the investment levels in other bets, the major point is that we're investing across other bets commensurate with what we think is required looking out at the opportunity set for each one.
And that was really to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain other bets.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn Cloud, one of the things that was evident toward the end of last year is now our ability to win very large customers, global 5,000 companies with multi-year contracts.
First, when you think about the strong Google sites growth, 22% FX neutral, can you just help us understand some of the mobile search innovations that you think are really driving things here beyond some of the just underlying secular strengths with a particular focus, perhaps, on the retail channel and just how you're thinking about the opportunities there?
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, in terms of growth, Cloud does continue to deliver a sizable revenue growth, driven by GCP.
I was curious, Sundar, as you think about with an innovation focus, what do you see as being one or two of the biggest opportunities to further improve the quality or the efficacy of the ad product you provide for advertisers on YouTube from here?
And we are taking all the right foundational steps to realize it.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd in terms of Waymo, as you know well, we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience.
Thank you very much.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, starting with R&D, the main driver is our ongoing investment in engineers, in particular, in Google and then as I said, the sizable increase in accrued comp for other bets.
And we wanna make sure we invest in that experience to get closer to what they want.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then on the second question, we've talked about this on prior calls.
And then we're investing aggressively in our newer businesses within Google, particularly Cloud and hardware as Sundar has already said.
A big part of that is the ongoing strength in YouTube and then on the OpEx side, investing in engineers, in particular for Google as well as on the sales and marketing side, the increased headcount to support not just Ads but, in particular, Cloud.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd on the same question on Cloud, I answered it around Anthony and Heather's question.
And then Ruth, coming back to the headcount and CapEx growth moderating comments -- so, you've had expenses growing well in excess of revenue for some time in the core Google segment.
And so, I think we'll continue down that path but obviously, always adapt to where the market is.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of the pace of investment, I've already laid out the focus areas and our commitment to invest to support long-term revenue and earnings growth.
I think many are just trying to search for a framework in how you think about this investment cycle we're in right now.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, the reason I started by laying out in response to the question on margins where we're investing and how we look at it is we are very focused on investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter.Our total revenues of $39.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $724 million or $600 million after the impact of our hedging program.
The key drivers were first, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, mostly for our advertising-supported content in what is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV which have higher TAC as a percentage of revenues; second, costs associated with our data centers in other operations including depreciation; and third, hardware related costs for our Made by Google and Nest family of products.
We provide more detail on these line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.Our effective tax rate was 11.2% for the fourth quarter, reflecting a discrete benefit due to the reversal of an accrual made as a result of updated guidance associated with the US Tax Act. Net income was $8.9 billion.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, cash CapEx for the quarter was $7.1 billion which I will discuss in the Google segment results.
The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by the ongoing shift to mobile which carries higher TAC followed by changes in partner agreements, offset by the seasonally higher proportion of YouTube advertising revenues in the fourth quarter.In Q4, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year primarily due to a revenue mix shift within our programmatic business.
I'll cover results for the full-year 2018 because it remains most instructive to look at the financials for other bets over a longer-term horizon, as we have discussed on prior calls.
With eight products with more than one billion users each and more people coming online every day, we remain excited by the opportunities to continue to create valuable experiences for users around the globe.In particular, we see significant ongoing potential to apply our machine-learning capabilities across our businesses.
Turning to investments and profitability, in terms of gross margin, the biggest component within cost of revenues remains our traffic acquisition costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business.
As we've discussed on prior calls, while the pace of year-on-year growth incites TA as a percentage of sites revenues slowed after the first quarter of 2018, we do expect the sites' TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search.Within OpEx, we remain focused on prioritization in order to optimize resources for longer-term growth in sizable markets.
From Smart Compose in Gmail to the new Google News experience to call screening on the Pixel and improving the overall safety of our products, AI is helping people get things done every day.
Google AI lead, Jeff Dean recapped the results of our efforts in a great post on our AI blog, like using AI to better detect the spread of breast cancer or providing flood victims with real-time information in a crisis.
As we do this, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to do the right thing and are continuing to build privacy and security into the core of our products, keeping users' data safe and secure with the industry's best security systems and giving people better and clearer controls.
Today, I'll start by sharing some of the new ways that we are working toward our mission.Then I'll give an update on our video and advertising platforms followed by the latest on our hardware and Cloud efforts.
And we demonstrated that at CES last month with lots of exciting new partners and features, from the Lenovo smart clock that wakes you up in the morning to real-time navigation that helps during your commute to a built-in interpreter that translates conversations across dozens of languages on Google Chrome.
Thanks to our strengths in AI in Search, Google Lens uses your smartphone camera to help identify more than one billion products.
YouTube continues to invest in its thriving community of creators and build great features for its nearly two billion monthly logged-in users.For instance, in Q4, we expanded access to tools like stories and community posts that strengthen the connections between fans and creators.
Since the product launched in March 2018, over 30% of the advertisers who use TrueView for Action were new to buying video adds on YouTube.
Google Cloud is a fast-growing multi-billion-dollar business that supports major global 5,000 companies in every important vertical with a robust enterprise organization.This was not the case just three years ago.
In financial services, we signed agreements with two of the top financial institutions in the US to help them transition their business to Google Cloud with our highly secure solutions.In retail, brands like Bed Bath & Beyond, DSW, and Ulta Beauty are using our cloud to manage data and provide more personalized experiences to consumers.
More than 20 years on, there is still tremendous opportunity for Google to help people save time, learn new things, grow their businesses, and build stronger communities.
I wanna thank every Googler around the world for making 2018 a great year for users and our business.
And that's really working at scale.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then the specific comment I think you're referencing is I was pointing to headcount growth.
A very strong quarter it sounds like on branded advertising and now some of these new direct response ads.
Maybe talk us through how you see the next one or two big factors that you're really focused on, ensuring that Waymo becomes what it could be.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn YouTube, I still think we are in early days of making sure YouTube is a better platform for direct response.
On your first question around using machine-learning to help serve advertisers better and be able to reach newer advertisers SMBs and local advertisers, I definitely think you highlight an exciting opportunity.
And they remain a strategy partner across multiple businesses for us, including Google Ads. And we have efforts under way to work closer together with shopping.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Ellen and good afternoon everyone.
Search and other Google properties continued to drive great results with total revenues in 2019 of $98 billion and strong growth.I am also really pleased with two of our newer growth areas.
And it now has over 20 million music and premium paid subscribers and over 2 million YouTube TV paid subscribers ending 2019 at a $3 billion annual run rate in YouTube subscriptions and other non-advertising revenues.Google Cloud ended 2019 at a more than $10 billion run rate, up 53% year-on-year driven by significant growth in GCP.
Among their broader efforts our Other Bets Verily and Calico are also partnering with the industry leaders to use AI and cloud technologies to improve clinical trials, research and drug development.Our thesis has always been to apply these deep computer science capabilities across Google and our Other Bets to grow and develop into new areas.
We have recently signed a 10-year agreement with Sabre to help them improve operations and develop new airline and hospitality services.Finally, Google Other revenue.
Our home devices demonstrate how this vision can come to life in creating the home of the future with our new Nest Mini a Nest Hub Max, selling well over the holidays, following on from the Pixel 3a, which sold well last year.With Pixel 4, we continue to build out our capabilities and are keenly focused on execution, delivering great user experiences and broadening our distribution.
This will show up as more seamless products across various services and platforms like the Google Assistant, deeper partnerships and better use of our shared infrastructure.
Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release.Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, was $21 billion, up 17% year-on-year.
We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $120 billion.Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment.
Ongoing growth in G Suite continued to reflect growth in both SMB and enterprise segments and both seat count and average revenue per seat.The other revenues line now consists of Google Play, followed by hardware and YouTube's non-advertising services, mainly its subscription offerings, YouTube Premium, YouTube Music and YouTube TV.
Within Play, app revenues had strong growth, driven by an increase in the number of active buyers.Total traffic acquisition costs were $8.5 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 14% year-over-year.
As Sundar shared earlier, the non-advertising services at YouTube mainly from subscriptions reached a $3 billion revenue run rate in the fourth quarter.
We have been investing heavily in developing our capabilities in hardware engineering as well as building out supply and physical distribution chains, and we've created a multi-billion dollar revenue business in the past three years.We're looking forward to our acquisition of Fitbit, which will add strong capabilities in wearables and advance our vision of ambient computing for the Android ecosystem.
Your line is now open.Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystHi. I think this is the best Google call or Alphabet call I've been on since I've covered the Company.
So last year, we set up a core infrastructure team, which looks at things like how does the user journey work across, what does the shared infrastructure engineers can't use so that we don't reinvent the wheel in multiple areas, how can we commonly deploy AI across all these products.
So I think that's been a good example of bringing teams together.Another big area where we invested like that to break down silos is our partnerships.
Your line is now open.Kevin Rippey -- Evercore -- AnalystHi. As you think about the risk profile of some of your businesses like Waymo, like Verily in healthcare, how do you manage those risks, which likely in a scenario where autonomous cars have some accident or something like that, having those in-house and perhaps brand damage that could do to Google versus what you could do if those were entirely separate enterprises?
I'd like to start by thanking Larry and Sergey for giving all of us at Google a timeless mission, enduring values and an opportunity to have an impact on the world.There's a lot I want to cover today and I also want to leave plenty of time for any questions you may have for me and Ruth.
The growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of Cloud overall and GCP's growth rate accelerated from 2018 to 2019.Before I talk about the highlights of the quarter, I want to take a step back and give some early thoughts about my approach to managing Alphabet and Other Bets.
This means optimizing our usage of computing resources and also growing business opportunities in areas like YouTube, Cloud, Play, hardware and beyond.So as you can see, there's a lot happening at the Company and a real sense of excitement and focus.
Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers.In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles, including the impact of the Looker acquisition, which closed in December.Operating income was $9.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year for an operating margin of 20%.
In the fourth quarter, other revenues were $5.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube and Play, offset by declines in hardware.
What's exciting for us, as we look ahead at Search and other Google properties, is the ongoing opportunity to support users and advertisers with new ads experiences and improved measurement.Second, with respect to YouTube advertising, at a year-on-year growth rate of more than 30% in the fourth quarter, we're pleased with the ongoing strength and opportunity at YouTube.
Given our position as a challenger, we're investing aggressively, focused on building out our go-to-market capabilities, executing against our product road map and extending the global footprint of our infrastructure focused on 21 markets and six industries.In terms of hardware, as Sundar noted in his opening remarks, we remain focused on the long-term opportunity with ambient computing.
As we look at the near-term product road map, we continue to execute at a measured pace.In Other Bets, we are sharpening our focus on the metrics and milestones against which capital allocation is determined and we continue to assess where external capital is additive to governance and execution.I'll now turn to the investments we're making in headcount and in capex to support the growth opportunities we see across Alphabet.
As of year-end, we had $21 billion remaining in the program and are focused on executing on the remaining authorization at a pace that is at least consistent with what you saw in the fourth quarter.In conclusion, we remain very confident about the opportunities across Alphabet and in our ability to continue to deliver at the steady pace we've shown.Sundar and I will now take your questions.Questions and Answers:OperatorThank you.
GCP had fantastic revenue momentum in the fourth quarter, and as we noted it is growing at a meaningfully higher pace than Google Cloud overall.In terms of your margin question, look, I think our view is obviously the competitive dynamics in the cloud market are very different today.
Thanks so much.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerEric, I think overall I presume you're meaning across everything we do and if that's the case, I am -- I mean, the trends we are seeing and we've been investing on it for a while but applying it and actually driving use cases to users.
Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then on your second question, at our scale, we're pleased with the rate of growth in 2019 here in Search and our ads business overall and we do see ample opportunity ahead.
Thanks.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerDoug, on Cloud, I think maybe a few thoughts on some of the progress we made last year and talk about the differentiation, which you asked about as well.
So if you take an area like healthcare, all the investments we are making in healthcare across Google, and in some cases, Alphabet.If you look at Sabre, the partnership we can bring to them across our experience working in travel verticals as well.
Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd in terms of your second question, investing for growth and how we balance growth and profitability, the approach to capital allocation and the pace of investing continues to be guided by the same three drivers that we've talked about previously.
And then third, as we've talked about on prior calls, is investing to support operational excellence and that includes things like driving efficiencies in our technical infrastructure, which I spoke about.When we look at the biggest investment areas within Google, we -- as we've talked about already on this call, continue to be focused on investing to support the growth that we see.
To my point earlier, when people engage with us on cloud, they're looking for -- they're interested in a bigger digital transformation across the board.Google Assistant is a great example of -- because we are focused on the user and the experience cuts across several of our product areas.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn the question around YouTube, I do think there is a lot of opportunity ahead.
So is this an investment year in your view or just kind of more of the steady kind of increase?And then second question, on YouTube a lot of discussion here about direct response impact and the opportunity there.
",28.34,0.84263647
47,google,q1,2019,"Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search along with important contributions from YouTube, followed by Cloud.For today's call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes.
The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of revenues.Operating expenses, including the impact of the EC fine were $13.7 billion.
Based on the continued strengthening of the US dollar relative to key currencies, we expect a continued headwind to our revenues and operating income again in the second quarter.In terms of our key revenue drivers, with respect to Sites revenues as we indicated last quarter, the timing of product changes in ads at times can have an impact on year-on-year growth rates.
With regard to Google OpEx, the first quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long-term.
In terms of sales and marketing, the pace of investment in Q1 reflected a timing shift in spend and we expect these expenses to pick up in the second quarter.
In Other Bets OpEx, we are still early in the life of these companies and do plan to continue to invest meaningfully for the long-term opportunity.With respect to CapEx, the year-on-year decline reflects the purchase of a building in New York in the first quarter of 2018.
We continue to expect a sizable investment in both compute requirements to support long-term growth as well as in-office facilities.In conclusion, we feel confident about the opportunities ahead and we continue to invest thoughtfully for the long-term.I will now turn the call over to Sundar.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Ruth.
And then more to your question, as we indicated last quarter, the other item is that timing of product changes in ads can impact year-on-year growth rates and we make changes with the focus on the best interest of users and advertisers.
And so while YouTube clicks continued to grow at a substantial pace in the first quarter, the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated versus what was a strong Q1 last year, reflecting changes that we made in early 2018, which we believe are overall additive to the user and advertiser experience.
In terms of CapEx, just to fill out the last part, I think, of your question, relative to my comments last quarter that we expect the full year 2019 growth rate for CapEx to moderate quite significantly versus the year-on-year growth in 2018, there is no change in our expectation for the year on that point, either the first quarter last year, obviously, included a sizable real estate acquisition in New York.
But overall, we continue to invest meaningfully in our technical infrastructure, given our outlook for compute requirements to support long-term growth.
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo in terms of the Sites TAC rate, a couple of things.
And just so we can understand a little bit, can you just help us with the key user experience you're trying to solve for and serve the message to your advertisers who may be spending -- or maybe growing their spend less now, why that's going to be positive for the long-term?
Really, just help us understand how that Hardware business is important to Google and how you're thinking about it long-term?
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo, in terms of the mobile search and the Sites revenue more broadly, I think the main point as we've both tried to indicate in the opening comments is we view the advertising opportunity is significant, given -- in particular the opportunity with machine learning both for users and advertisers as well as our commitment to product innovation and -- being the backdrop of an environment in which nearly half of ad budgets in the US are still spent offline and about 90% of commerce in the US is still offline and we're focused on digital playing a bigger role in that and tapping into other marketing budgets by offering an attractive ROI.
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo in terms of the regions, the year-on-year growth rates reflect the product comments that I made with respect to the first quarter.
We're well positioned, growth throughout the regions, Sundar's comment on some of the things that we're seeing a big focus on the next billion users and excited about the opportunities across the board there.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd I don't think there were any demand issues for -- to the last part of your question.
We're excited about the opportunities ahead, we do continue to invest to ensure we remain well positioned for the long-term.
Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.And now, I'll turn the call over to Ruth.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Ellen.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which, we will take your questions.Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.Operating income was $6.6 billion.
Google Cloud platform remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet, with strong customer momentum reflected in particular in demand for our compute and data analytics products.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $4.5 billion, reflecting investments in data centers, servers and office facilities.Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets.
We remain confident about the sizable opportunity ahead to improve the advertiser end user experience through our ongoing commitment to product innovation in particular by leveraging machine learning across our ads, products and properties.Turning to the key drivers of growth in other revenues.
You'll hear a lot more from each of these teams throughout May, so I hope you can join us.We've always been a company that's focused on the long-term, willing to make investments that will help our businesses and our customers' businesses succeed as technology continues to evolve.
What gives us these opportunities is Google's position to help people, businesses and society in countless space through our products.Today, I'll start by talking about our core mission of making information universally accessible and useful.
As part of our Google News initiative, we kicked off the Local Experiments Project, working with local publishers to uncover new approaches to their business models and operations, so they can continue bringing great local content to the readers.AI's now spurring a new era of computing, which is more predictive and more assistive.
Recently at TensorFlow's Annual Developer Summit, we announced TensorFlow 2.0, making it easier than ever to build and use ML through improvements like TensorFlow Privacy, which helps train models with differential privacy, meaning that users' data is better protected.Now, on to our computing video and advertising platforms.
This year, viewership of Super Bowl ads on YouTube during the game rose by nearly 60%.More broadly, across our Ads business, our advertising product team led by Prabhakar continues to build new products for marketers with more than 100 enhancements introduced every quarter.
Lastly, at the Game Developers Conference, we introduced a host of new advertising solutions for developers, like app campaigns for engagement, which help developers reengage players with relevant ads across Google's properties.Next, I'll give an update on our Hardware and Cloud efforts.
Consumer package goods brands like Unilever, manufacturing and industrial companies like Samsung and UPS and public sector organizations like Australia Post.Finally, to support our customers' growth, we also announced the addition of two new cloud regions in Seoul and Salt Lake City, which we plan to open in 2020.
We also feel a deep responsibility to make sure that we -- that as we grow our business, we are doing it with minimal impact on the environment.Today, a Google data center uses 50% less energy than a typical data center, while delivering 7 times more computing power than we did five years ago.
So just wondering, if that's a wise way to infer anything about the relative performance of mobile search revenue versus YouTube from those cost lines in the quarter?
Was there any go to market changes in terms of the sales force or how you set quarter or anything that may have been effectively a Q1 seasonality issue that may see some snap back in Q2?Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
",27.93,0.52612484
48,google,q2,2019,"To make products work even harder for you, we have continued to invest in our hardware business, bringing together the best of Google's hardware, software, andAI.
We continue to build our world-class cloud team to help support our customers and expand the business and are looking to triple our salesforce over the next few years.
I want to thank Googlers around the world for another great quarter.With that, I'll hand it over to Ruth.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Sundar.
Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar to-date relative to the third quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the third quarter.As a reminder, FX headwinds affect both revenues and operating income given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S. Turning to revenues.
With respect to Sites revenues, the strength in the second quarter again reflects our ongoing innovation in part from the benefits of applying machine learning.
In fact, in the second quarter of 2019, as Sundar mentioned, the annual run rate for Cloud revenues was over $8 billion and Cloud continues to deliver significant growth.
With respect to capital allocation.Our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments.
And making sure, digging deeper to push our products to be more helpful is the main theme, by which we are evaluating everything we do.Beyond that be it, the focus on cloud has been a big part of it, continuing to scale up YouTube including being focused on content responsibility.
And so taking a long-term view, I think it will resonate on the monetization side as well.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd just building a bit of that question and the impact from some of the announcements that you've seen from us.
And really pleased with the ongoing momentum that we're seeing here.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn user privacy and control, it's always been a big focus for us in some of the things we recently announced.
And the key point that I'll just reiterate is that as much as there is a lot of innovation going on in the business and we've talked about that, we introduced product changes only after extensive testing and that means there can be variability in quarterly growth rates as you've seen.
And as we discussed last quarter, there can be timing variability and our view is let's ensure that we stay focused on the right things for the long-term and the quality that we can deliver.
Thanks.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo in terms of YouTube growth, just maybe to add a bit more there given your question.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn the first in terms of YouTube for brand, I would say it's more secular across the platform promoting higher-quality content, our work on brand safety, content, responsibility adds up to it.
And I think that's what we'll stay focused on as a company.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd in terms of GDPR, we did implement late in the second quarter of 2018.
We are very focused on investing to support the ongoing growth we see across Google in particular as we're talking about in Search while we're also investing to build new businesses most notably in Cloud as we've talked a lot about here today.
And as we both commented given the opportunities we see with the application of machine learning across the business, we are continuing to invest.
And finally, as we've talked about investing to support operational excellence.But the mega point is that we are excited about the long-term opportunity and we're continuing to invest which is why in opening comments, I wanted to make sure to call out what we're seeing with respect to ongoing investments and across the business the increases in headcount and the reasons for them at the benefits of those investments as well as sales and marketing and the fact that that is back half loaded and -- back half weighted I should say.
We are committed to continue to invest for what we see as a long-term opportunities.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd on the mobile question, we are definitely investing in Android with a focus on the next billion users as well as making sure the mobile experience continues to evolve.
And in terms of the next billion users there's a lot of headroom there over time and we are focused on.
A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerThanks Ellen.
Demand across our helpful Home products continues to increase as we expand to new markets.
Beyond hardware, we continue to develop the open platforms and ecosystems that push computing forward such as Android, Google Play, and Chrome.At I/O, we showed some exciting improvements to Android Q.
Moving from, YouTube to a broader advertising platforms, at Google Marketing Live we introduced new ad formats such as Discovery ads, which offer a new visually rich mobile-first ad experience across Google properties.
We also announced Google Travel, a new centralized travel destination where people can plan and organize all aspects of their next trip all in one place, from booking flights and accommodations to planning activities.Now on to our Cloud business, Q2 was another strong quarter for Google Cloud, which reached an annual revenue run rate of over $8 billion and continues to grow at a significant pace.
Finally Google Cloud's AI and ML solutions are also helping healthcare organizations, like Sanofi, accelerate drug discovery and as such, improve the healthcare experience and outcomes.
In Europe, we recently announced EUR1 billion data center investment in the Netherlands, as well as the opening of our Google Safety Engineering Center in Munich Germany.
Ahead of the games, we are working with the City of Tokyo to ensure Japanese businesses can better serve new customers and help visitors make the most of their time there using products like Search, Maps and Translate.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses.The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centres and other operations, including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues.
Operating expenses were $12.5 billion with headcount growth as the largest driver across each of R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A.
Growth in sales and marketing expenses also reflects an increase in advertising and promotional expense, primarily for the launch of our Pixel 3a lineup.
Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within network, namely Google Ad Manager followed by AdMob.Other revenues for Google were $6.2 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fuelled by Cloud with an ongoing strong contribution from Play.
G Suite continues to be a valid set of productivity and work transformation apps with the results benefiting from both new pricing and seed growth.
With regard to Google operating expenses, the second quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long-term.At this point, we expect that our 2019 headcount growth rate will be closer to the 2018 rate, in other words slightly higher than we originally forecast for a couple of reasons.
Can you give us a little bit of additional color on what's some of the key investments you're making, some of the key themes you're trying to drive after in terms of pushing the organization to collaborate on product launches and leveraging the strength within Google?
I think what's notable here is that every year at GML, we announced new changes to products and features and most ads product launches are introduced in phases as advertisers initially experiment with new formats.
And so I just wanted to add in here because while we're excited about the new ads products we announced to GML last quarter, given the offer great new user expenses across new services, we don't view this year's slate of launches differently from introductions made in previous years.Eric Sheridan -- UBS -- AnalystThank you.OperatorThank you.
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, it does include the entire business that Thomas Kurian is leading.
Growth in GCP was led by strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products and G Suite continues to deliver strong growth, as I noted in the opening comments, with the results benefiting from both new pricing and C growth.
But really I would reiterate what we said previously that we continue to see substantial growth in direct response.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd on your important question about kids' safety, as part of our content responsibility work it's one of the most important areas we focus on.
And then just second coming back to Google Marketing Live notwithstanding your comments Ruth that it take some time for products to be adopted.
And I was hoping you might provide a couple of specific examples of how the company is leveraging machine learning recently to help drive growth and improvements for both users and advertisers?
Thanks.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerFor us, machine learning plays a critical role across both the consumer user experience and part of ads too.
",43.9,0.87498087
49,google,q4,2017,"Substantial growth in other revenues, namely hardware, cloud, and Play, continues the highlight the benefits of our investments.Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22.2 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.Network revenues were $5 billion, up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $4.7 billion, up 38% year-over-year, fueled by hardware, cloud, and Play.
As we've consistently emphasized, alongside the continued momentum in our advertising business, we are focused on building a second wave of growth within Google over the medium and long-term, which in includes the rapidly growing revenue businesses in Google cloud, hardware, and YouTube.With respect to cloud, we are seeing the benefits of a fully featured enterprise offering and an expanded go-to-market team bringing our advantages and infrastructure, data analytics, security, and machine learning to more customers.
Finally, as we look further into the future for our third wave of growth, we remain excited about the longer-term potential for our Other Bets businesses.Overall, operating income was up 22% year-over-year in 2017, excluding the impact of the EC fine, although there was obviously fluctuation in the rate of operating income growth quarter to quarter.
While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue will slow after the first quarter of 2018.Within OpEx, we are keenly focused on prioritization in order to optimize the resources we are investing for longer-term growth.
For 2016 we remain excited about the investments we are making to drive the next phase of growth in our big bets in Google and cloud, hardware, and YouTube, and our machine learning efforts, which are powering innovation across our businesses.
Our hardware is beautiful individually and as a family, and people love discovering the unique features like the built-in Google assistant.Earlier this week we officially closed our deal with HTC, which will bring great talent to drive even more innovation in the years to come.Turning to our efforts in machine learning, our AI research and innovation leads the world.
People love to use the assistant on all these devices.There was a lot of excitement around the Google Assistant at Sears from partners and consumers, where we brought the Assistant to new surfaces like smart displays from brands like JBL and Lenovo, as well as Android Auto, which is now available in more than 400 car models from brands like GM, Hyundai, and Volvo.One area that's really benefiting from our advancements in AI is photography.
In addition to the significant work, we are doing to protect users and stop abuse on the platform, just a few weeks ago we announced changes to advertising on YouTube, including stricter monetization criteria, new manual reviews for all videos in Google Preferred, and simpler controls for marketers.
Sundar, coming out of CES and the success you had with Google Home and the Google Assistant during the holiday period based on the blog post you guys put out, can you identify some of the key investments in either partnerships or hardware or capabilities that you're targeting over the next one to two years to make sure the momentum around Assistant is sustained?And then, Ruth, looking at cost of goods sold, that came in quite a bit higher than we thought, and you were lapping a one-time charge, if we have it right, versus the year-ago period.
So, I'm very bullish on it.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of the gross margins, it obviously reflects our product mix, and as you know well, the TAC rate for each of sites and network is a percentage as revenues lines does continue to increase because they are our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic and so carry higher TAC.
Third is CapEx, and we continue to invest in machines to support growth we see across Google but in particular, supporting cloud, search, YouTube and all that we're doing in machine learning.And then finally that leaves return of capital, and when we considered all of that, that's what led us to have the board extend the share repurchase program, which we announced a couple of years ago.
And, obviously, e-commerce is evolving a lot, and we continue to invest there.Google Shopping is doing well, and we work hard to make sure we bring the best experience possible, which is why as it evolves with search and Assistant we partner with companies like Walmart, for example, to make it much easier to buy products and so on.
Consumer behavior is changing, but we are comfortable given the breadth of how we do things and how we are focused on user experience there.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd on your question on desktop, there really isn't one particular item to call out here, and that's why last quarter I tried to walk through the process that our team goes through.
And then also on YouTube, anything around new products or features driving the monetization or ad business?And then, Ruth, just a question on the growth in marketing spend in the fourth quarter.
And then just related to that, are you getting a good return on investment from this marketing spend, particularly when you think about media mix and all the spend that we've seen on TV as compared to digital marketing?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn YouTube, we are continuing to see great momentum.
So, a lot of momentum there.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of sales and marketing, as I said, it particularly supported hardware but was also supporting cloud and YouTube.
Both Sundar and I have said these are important Google growth areas for us, and we are investing to support growth in the business.
And we just continue to be focused on doing the right things to support growth of the business.The fourth quarter does reflect the obvious seasonality.
And, again, we continue to look across the various products at their needs and try and prioritize, but we remained committed to long-term growth.OperatorThank you, and our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.Starting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter.
Specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers and other operations including depreciation, hardware-related costs for our expanded Made By Google family of products and content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube.Operating expenses were $10.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year in particular reflecting an increase in marketing spend given the holiday season.Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we place on this business.Operating income was $7.7 billion, up 15% versus last year, and the operating margin was 24%.
We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $102 billion.Let me now turn to our segment financial results starting with the Google segment.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets.
We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets.A couple of updates: Nest turned in a strong holiday performance in the fourth quarter across an expanded family or product in energy, safety, and security.
Both mobile and desktop search continues to grow and benefit from our approach to innovation with strong momentum as we identify additional opportunities to enhance the user and advertiser experience.
The most sizable catalyst for added investment in computing power include the expanding application of machine learning efforts across Alphabet as well as additional requirements for Google's cloud, search, and YouTube businesses.
After taking these potential investments into account, our board has decided to extend our share repurchase program up to an additional $8.6 billion of Class C capital stock.In conclusion, 2017 was another great year, and we are very excited about the opportunities ahead.
Google Cloud, which includes Google Cloud platform and G Suite has reached meaningful scale, and I'm excited to share today that it's already a $1 billion per quarter business.
I learned that this week.With all this great content, people are thinking of YouTube more as a key part of their TV viewing experience.
On New Year's Eve alone, over 3 billion photos and videos were uploaded to Google Photos.More broadly, we want everyone to be able to use machine learning for their own needs.
We launched major initiatives, such as total visit measurement and location-based ads formats to drive online to offline commerce.We have focused on making sure YouTube is a great place for users and advertisers while helping creators earn money from popular content.
Having increased both the number of products in the Made by Google family as well as continue to expand geographically in western Europe and A Pac, you can see that reflected here.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
And then, maybe too just as a follow-up, if you can provide just a little bit more color on Google Pay in terms of what might be different this round versus previous attempts?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerMaybe I'm not fully sure I understood all the specifics there, but at a high level as people are on the go, they're traveling, etcetera, if anything I think search is more invaluable than ever before.
As we move from just answers to helping users complete actions over time, including transactions, their ability to complete the transaction is an important part of it, which is why making sure Google Pay in a unified way works as seamlessly as possible is a big part of our long-term strategy.OperatorThank you, and our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse.
But it would be getting ahead of ourselves to go further out than what we've laid out here.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn the video gaming side, I think we maybe today have a lot of momentum in these areas both with YouTube as a platform, Google Play.
",33.55,0.6269061
50,google,q3,2019,"Q3 was another great quarter at Google with strong revenue growth driven by mobile search YouTube and Cloud.
First powered by our long-term investment in AI, we dramatically improved our understanding of the questions people ask Google search.
In September, we announced a landmark partnership with Mayo Clinic, using Google Cloud to secure and store data and understand insights at scale.
National Australia Bank recently added Google Cloud to its multi-cloud strategy to help the Company better use data and deliver new and improved customer experiences.Deutsche Borse Group, the fourth largest Stock Exchange Group worldwide relies on Google Cloud to help them navigate the twin challenge of modernizing their digital operations and addressing significant regulatory requirements.
We continue to extend our Cloud services through partners, including a new solution that enables customers to run VMware workloads on GCP for the first time.
We also announced a new Cloud region in Poland our seventh in Europe.Turning to Google's products that people use every day.
On a personal note, I was in Dallas in October, where I saw firsthand how important Google is helping small and medium-size businesses grow.
Our growth with Google program has helped train 3 million Americans in digital skills, including small business owners and entrepreneurs.
Sundar and I will then take your questions.Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment was $17.6 billion, up 23% year-on-year.
The biggest contributor again this quarter was costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues.
This line also includes the impact of hardware cost primarily associated with our mid-tier Pixel 3a smartphones.Operating expenses were $13.8 billion, with head count growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for both R&D and sales and marketing, which is reflected in both compensation and facilities expenses.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were again in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.Operating income was $9.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year for an operating margin of 23%.
Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 8% year on year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within network namely Google Ad Manager followed by AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $6.4 billion, up 39% year-over-year, once again fueled by Cloud followed by a strong performance from Play.Within Cloud, growth in GCP was once again the primary driver of performance with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products, complemented by ongoing growth in G suite, reflecting both new pricing and C growth.
Google accrued capex for the quarter was $7.2 billion reflecting investments in office facilities and data centers, followed by servers.
Within other revenues, in addition to continued strength in compute, Google Cloud saw substantial growth from data analytics as customers are seeing the benefits from implementing big query.
Obviously search is an important area, Image Search, YouTube, Maps are all great surfaces by which I think users come with varying degrees of commercial interest looking to discover and at times transact as well.
I have two, Sundar, there's clearly a lot of innovation happening at Google, but I'm wondering how do you think about the increase in scrutiny and oversay possibly impacting your ability to explore new services or new markets over time and ultimately to remain competitive?
In search, we made a number of improvements to make it easier for users to find key moments and videos, to easily find products with images via Google Lens and discover new podcast.Our hardware business is still in its early stages, but we are continuing to build the business and the portfolio of healthful products.
As a reminder, there is variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates from quarter-to-quarter as we've often discussed, we manage our business for the long term and not on a quarterly basis and we remain very focused on continuing to enhance the experience for users and advertisers over the long term.
Looking forward, we anticipate the primary driver of capex investment will continue to be our expected compute requirements, particularly to support ongoing demand for machine learning across our business, as well as for Cloud, Search and YouTube.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer of GoogleYou know in general, local is an important area for us and we are continuing to invest in building our experience that connects merchants, advertisers and users.
So be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Discover, be it Maps and that's the way we envisioned that and -- but small and medium business is a big area of focus and Maps represents a big long-term opportunity for us.Ruth M.
Porat -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice PresidentAnd just to add on there, given your reference back to GML, and I think we talked about this last quarter as well.
I wanted to ask another one about a new product, you guys announced earlier this year at GML and that was really Google Shopping and moving that across some of the different properties like YouTube and Image search and Discover.
Thanks.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer of GoogleIn general, I think it's a great opportunity for us.
Porat -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice PresidentAnd again, these are still earlier stage and it's, we're excited about the longer term impact, but just again make it clear, we're just still in the earlier stages of testing?Lloyd Walmsley -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay, thank you.OperatorThank you.
So things like planning vacations are assessing insurance options, what we see is users continue to go back to desktop, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile and I think one of the things that we've been very focused on is that innovations that benefit mobile also enhance the desktop experience for users and advertisers.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer of GoogleAnd then in terms of -- obviously we've been -- over time, we have developed a very comprehensive metric for measuring and tracking search -- search quality -- to get a sense of such quality in how user satisfaction is through search.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer of GoogleOn the first part, we consistently want to work and build products that benefit users and support the ecosystem.
Porat -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice PresidentSo in terms of the first question, I think as Sundar and I talked about, we're pleased with the strength of the business that you've seen here again in the third quarter.
You give us, I think some updates on monthly active users or DAUs in the past, any update there would be great or maybe any additional color on sort of how the total amount of usage goes on there is that's obviously been featured to users a little bit more.And then second, maybe just a follow-up for Ruth, Sundar spoke at length about your investments in renewable energy earlier and maybe keeping with the theme of the earnings call, you could help us understand how that is or maybe is not helping drive efficiencies across the country -- across the company and your operating costs overall.
Thanks.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer of GoogleDiscover is a product we are very excited about.
So these are -- we want to be helpful to users in a way that makes sense for them more continually and the combination of search and Discover helps us do that.Ruth M.
Porat -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice PresidentAnd as much as we're extremely excited about the long-term implications for Quantum Computing, part of your question there about our near-term computing requirements, given our outlook in particular across Google, we do expect to see ongoing demand for compute investments to support our growth, particularly for Machine Learning, Cloud, Search and YouTube.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer of GoogleSubscriptions is an area we are definitely excited about.
As in the first and second quarter, the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated in the third quarter, that does continue to reflect the changes that we made in early 2018 to really improve the user and advertiser experience.

51,jpmc,q4,2017,"The capital impact is $1.2 billion higher, at $3.6 billion or about 25 basis points of CET1, and our effective tax rate will be approximately 19% this year and 20% over the near term, think through 2020, after which it should start to gradually increase as certain business credit will phase out over time.
Adjusted expense of $14.8 billion was up 9% year on year, reflecting higher compensation expense as well as business growth, including auto-lease depreciation.In the fourth quarter we took an impairment charge of a little over $100 million related to certain leased assets in the commercial bank and we increased our contribution to the foundation, adding $200 million this quarter.
Revenue crossed back over the $100 billion threshold this year, which feels good: $104 billion, up 5%, $4.1 billion of which was higher net interest income, in line with guidance, benefiting from higher rates and growth, relatively modest deposit repricing but pressured by lower market NII.
We ended the year with CET1 of 12.1%, down almost 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, about 25 basis points of which related to tax adjustments and the remainder low growth.All the other ratios,as well as tangible book value per share, also reflected a combination of $6.7 billion of capital distributions and the $3.6 billion impact of tax reform.
Consumer and business banking revenue was up 16% on higher NII driven by continued margin expansion as well as strong average deposit growth.
In addition to higher rates, we continue to see organic growth within the business, as the investments we've made over the past several years have improved our clients' experience across the platform.Securities services revenue of $1 billion was up 14%, driven by rates and balances, with average deposits up 12% year on year and higher asset-based fees on record AUC given higher market levels globally.
The revenue outlook seems to be quite strong for the banking industry generally in 2018 and many investors were wondering if the 55% overhead ratio a long-term target for JP Morgan regardless of the revenue environment or could that potentially be better over the short term as we get a boost in the economy from the tax act?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYou are right.
I'm wondering if you could share your insights on how you think those activity trends will shape up in 2018.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYea. People have different points of view.Our research team is saying by up to 30 basis points in each of the next two years but know it could be better than that.
We think that we are adequately capitalized, that we should expect to have the capital ratio move down slowly over time and our strategy on potentially continuing to see dividend increases and having repurchase programs that allow us to achieve our target ratios, that hasn't changed, it just might be a bigger dollar number.OperatorOur next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystHi, good morning.
And then consumer credit, broadly speaking, auto's continued to look a little bit better and cards still within your expectation, so a lot of the focus on tax has obviously been on the potential for commercial lending to potentially pick up.
Are you seeing any change in propensity to revolve from your customers or is your balanced growth coming more from new customers or is there any increase in kind of revolve rate?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerWe actually had been on a pretty significant strategic drive to make sure that we had at a DPDC-engaged customer base, if you go back pre-crisis and look at the industry there was lots of [Inaudible] and less-engaged customers.
You know that the ultimate impact for your business shouldn't be material and at the same time, the guidance from some of your foreign bank competitors, suffice it to say, has been much more measured.I'm wondering if the impact's not that material for you guys but weighs more heavily on the peer set, do you actually see your market-share consolidation opportunity emerging in particular within the repo and sec-lending side?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
I'm just trying to think through how you might tweak your business model to focus on some of your products in some of those markets.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. And if you think about something as first-order as housing in high-tax states, people are pretty situated where they live with their families and their jobs, and higher-income borrowers are typically less price-sensitive.
So, hopefully, the monetary policy will be gradual and as expected and we will continue to see the front-end rates and everything be rational, and of course there could be surprises but at some point, yes, but not in the near future.Could you say what's the average maturity of your corporate loan book or across the loan book in general?It differs.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt's clearly disclosed in the 10-K, but it's different for every single product, and it also changes, interest rates move around.OperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystHi. Good morning.
And if you are talking about a very, very scaled, very, very high-volume business with extraordinarily tight margins, it will probably have ultimately or at least in the very, very near term less impact but, again, I actually think people to be quite disciplined how they think about this.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerCan I give you an example away from finance?
So, I can tell you that looking at that decomposition of, what's higher market levels and higher flows by region and looking at the portion of our revenues that related to assets under custody that they were in line.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd full-year effect doesn't happen for 12 months.
Finally, on the potential impact to our businesses, the modernization of the U.S. tax code is a significant step forward for the country and a big win for the economy, and we include an estimated 20 to 30 basis points of growth in the U.S. this year and next.
Revenue of $25.5 billion was up $1.1 billion, or 5% year on year, as net interest income was up $1.3 billion, mainly reflecting the impact of higher rates and continued strong loan and deposit growth, partially offset by lower NII in market.
We continued to grow core loans, up 8% year on year, driven by home lending, up 13%, and business banking, card, and auto loans and leases were each up 6%.Consumer deposit growth was strong, up 7%, and we believe we are maintaining our sizable lead over the market despite an industrywide slowdown given rising rates.
Our originations were down 15% in a market down an estimated 25%, and we gained share, a trend we expect to continue given our investments.Card and merchant services and auto revenue was up 11 % year on year on higher auto lease income, growth in card loan balances and margins, and lower net acquisition costs.
The overhead ratio was 55% for the quarter, 56% for the year, as the business moved past the impact of investments and started generating positive operating leverage in the second half of 2017.Finally, on credit, card charge-offs came in line with guidance for the year, at 2.95%.
Expense for the quarter of $2.3 billion was up 8% year on year, driven by a combination of higher compensation as well as a growth [Inaudible] for external fees, which is offset in revenue.For the quarter we saw long-term net inflow of $30 billion, with positive flows across all asset classes on continued, strong long-term performance.
We estimate for the full-year impact will increase both revenues and expenses for the firm by another $1.2 billion, the vast majority of which will be in asset and wealth management with a small amount in the CIB.So for guidance, expect the first-quarter NII will be down modestly quarter on quarter, reflecting a combination of a lower growth, as I mentioned, as well as normal day count, which offset the benefits of higher rates and growth.
So to wrap up, the end of 2017 was constructive, characterized by strong equity markets, higher interest rates, good economic base globally, decent client activity, high levels of confidence, and obviously the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Against that backdrop, our underlying financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 was strong, benefiting from diversification and scale, and consistently delivering for our customers and communities, gaining share across our businesses.Adjusting for significant items in the year, net income and EPS would have been [Inaudible], driving a healthy 13% return on tangible common equity.
So, we just need to, I think, be a little patient to see some of that play out but sentiment is strong, tax positions will be improved, profitability will be higher, things that were rich before will be more fairly valued now.So, I think it should be all very constructive and certainly we would take the upside and support our clients.OperatorOur next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystHey, good morning.
If I think about, your guidance for the first quarter, down slightly, you have two less days in the quarter, that's maybe almost $300 million sequentially and then half of the impact from the tax act in terms of tax-equivalent adjustments that's going to be [Inaudible] NII, sort of linear and equal.So that's another $150 million.
So, my expectation, just given where we are in the absolute level of rates, is on the retail space, we would still see a lot of discipline in the market in 2018 but ultimately we haven't changed our expectations that whatever that pipeline looks like, we're going to get to an overall reprice of above 50% but we'll have to see.OperatorOur next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Betsy.OperatorMs. Hi, good morning.
Do you feel like it's equal across those or is there a skew that you're thinking about to take advantage of this because how managements use this benefit is going to be critical for stock performance over the next two to three years.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerI'll give you a framework to think about it if it's helpful, and you can certainly ask a follow-up question, but you are very familiar with the way that we think about sort of our strategy over time and our investment strategy in particular, and investing in our businesses, growth and profitability has always been first and foremost in our minds and, to be honest, we've talked to you before about the fact that we don't constrain ourselves because we have budgetary targets on those activities if we think we can execute well and we see great opportunities.
You did build the reserve for growth, as you mentioned, but most of the card revenue rate was also still a little bit down.Can you just talk a little bit about your outlook for that card business as you look forward?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, I'll just deal with the card-revenue rate real quick, because I think we sort of gave a little bit of this in the third quarter that given the Sapphire Reserve products, given the extraordinary success we had with that in the fourth quarter of 2016, there is annual travel credit renewal that took place in the fourth quarter, which we already told you you would expect, to see the revenue-rate go down.
And then the philosophical question, if Jamie's there, if he can answer after you, should that be crucial for stock performance, how much you allow to fall to the bottom line?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerLook, I'm not going to give you quantification, but you're not meaningfully wrong about the sort of assessment you made, which is a big, significant positive and most of it will fall through our bottom line in 2018 and beyond and time is an important part to how it plays out.
It will enhance our growth in the future too, by the way, it's not a giveaway.It's kind of a thoughtful approach to how we should use some of this.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd I do want to just say, there are two other things just to add to what Jamie said, which is, if some of this is competed way out over time, and gets to a lower cost of credit and cost of borrowing and improved pricing for our customers and allows them to grow their businesses and spend more strongly, there is a feedback loop.
So, you, Marianne, or Jamie, a year from now do you think that the tax code or other factors will result in increase in capital markets activity, increase in corporate lending and increase in CAPEX, which we've been waiting for all decade?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAgain, I think it is really important to note people focus very much what happens to [Inaudible] in the tax reform and I think it's a very good thing.
Marianne, I was wondering about charge-offs and credit.Things look good this quarter for the full year, came in line with your kind of $5 billion charge-off outlook.
Would you change it or you want to just keep it the way it is?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYea. I mean, for what it's worth, we should know our house view on interest rates is for there to be four hikes next year.
Can you talk to that a little bit and speak to which products and businesses you see more scope for competition, less scope for competition, and how does that influence how you think about investing in, across your different businesses?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, I would start by saying that I think we showed at Investor Day last year and if we could do something similar, maybe we will.
",22.89,0.6846795
52,jpmc,q1,2018,"To put this quarter's performance into context, on a core basis, pre-tax earnings grew 13% year-on-year, benefiting from higher rates, solid growth across other revenue drivers, and continued investments in our businesses.
And even excluding the benefit of tax reform, net income was a clear record this quarter.Included in the results you see on the page, approximately $500 million of mark-to-market gains on certain investments previously held at cost due to the adoption of a new accounting standard.
So the reduction was driven by higher risk-rated assets, reflecting the increased level of market activity, which similarly impacted all other ratios.In the quarter, the firm distributed $6.7 billion of capital to shareholders and last week, we submitted our 2018 CCAR capital plan to the Federal Reserve.
But also, based upon our data, they appear to spending more, reflecting a continued high level of confidence.Client investment assets were up 13% year-on-year, with half of the growth from net new money flows and with record flows this quarter.
The Card revenue rate was 11.6% in the quarter.Expense of $6.9 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by investment in technology and marketing, higher auto lease depreciation, and continued underlying business growth.
In addition, we saw share gains in cash and continued client activity driving growth in prime, as the investments that we've made in the business are paying off.Treasury services and security services revenue were both $1.1 billion for the quarter and up 14% and 16%, respectively, driven by higher rates and balances.
And you will recall that last year included a legal benefit and last quarter, of course, included the impact of tax reform.Finally, turning to Page 10 and the outlook, given Investor Day is only six weeks behind us, we've not changed our guidance for the full year of 2018.
And while acknowledging the tailwinds of tax reform and higher rates, the consistent performance of business drivers is translating into top-line growth and positive operating leverage, with revenues and pre-tax income both up double digits year-on-year.So with that, Operator, we can take some questions.Questions and Answers:OperatorCertainly, ma'am.
Kind of pros and cons, where do you have LIBOR sensitivity on the asset side and where do you have it on the funding cost, sensitivity to LIBOR, and how should we think net about that?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYeah.
But a bit of the sort of outsized year-on-year increase is seeing the somewhat tailwind of Card and Markets, both in the trading and in the asset management space.OperatorOur next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHi, thanks very much.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentHey, Glenn.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHello.
The simple question I have is, hearing you loud and clear on everything related to risk-based capital, but the clear improvement on the leverage side and SLR, does that theoretically, I know this is just a proposal right now, would that theoretically free up more activity in repo land and other short-term investments that soak up leverage, capital, but not much risk-based capital?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentSo generally across the sort of whole industry, I suspect the answer to the question is yes.
So this will unfold over the course of the next year or so.OperatorOur next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentHey, Matt.Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGood morning.
And you saw the balance sheet also go up and risk-rated assets and so on.OperatorOur next question is from Erica Najarian of Bank of America.Erica Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystHi, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentHi, Erica.
Morning.Erica Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystSo my first question to you, Marianne, is, if the Stress Capital Buffer becomes final as proposed and now the industry has a BAU CT1 minimum that could move year to year, how does that change your outlook on how to think about dividends and buybacks from here?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentOkay.
And so whether it's in a higher or lower SEB or whether it has to be taken into consideration so that we aren't caught sideways from a test result that is, with respect, once a year and a little big opaque.The second thing I would highlight to you is, for what it's worth, we saw our Investor Day, I won't say guidance, but sort of indication that we would expect to try and have payouts at or around 100%, plus or minus.
Shouldn't we expect securities yields to be moving higher in this environment?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYes, you should.
Are you feeling just better or was it also related to kind of just the growth math starting to look a little bit better in Card and Auto?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentSo I would say we still feel really good about the consumer.
Any updated thoughts on just that trajectory and where you expect that to go over time now?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYeah.
Probably higher for the year.OperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentHi.OperatorMr. Martinez, your line is open.
And could you give us some color on what you guys are seeing geographically on deposit growth and the competition?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYeah.
Are you still on that trajectory of where you think you should be?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYeah.
Against that, there were a number of other smaller but nevertheless notable items, including changes in credit reserves, FDA investment securities and private equity losses, and legal, which together substantially offset those gains.Underlying results continue to be strong: average core loan growth, excluding the CIB, of 8% year-on-year; card sales and merchant processing volumes up 12% and 15%, respectively; we maintained our No. 1 rank in global IB fees; and have net income of $1 billion in the commercial bank.
Non-interest revenue was up $1.6 billion year-on-year, and while this includes the mark-to-market gains on the first page, it also includes approximately $400 million of losses on investment securities and negative private equity investments.Adjusted expense of $16 billion was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher compensation expense as well as business growth, including auto lease depreciation.
In wholesale, we had a net reserve release of about $170 million driven by a single oil and gas loan.You'll see that our effective tax rate for the quarter ended a little above 18% compared to the 17% guidance we gave, driven by a combination of higher pre-tax earnings as well as geographical mix.
Consumer and Business Banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued by continued margin expansion and deposit growth.
Recall, last year included a net impact of a little over $200 million related to the student loan portfolio sale.Turning to Page 6 and the Corporate and Investment Bank.
1 in global M&A wallet and gain share in every region and, for the quarter, we announced and completed more deals than any other bank.Equity underwriting fees were down 19% in a market that was also down and versus a strong first quarter last year, which included a number of large deals.
Accounting for both of these items, Markets revenues would have been up about 7%.Fixed Income Markets adjusted revenue was flat versus a strong first quarter last year, with rates and spread markets reverting to more normal levels following significant outperformance last year, being offset by strong emerging markets and commodities performance.It was a record quarter for equities, as revenue was up 25%, a well-diversified story, driven by broad strength and continued momentum throughout the quarter, with increased volatility benefiting all equities derivatives.
Securities services also benefited from asset-based fee growth on both market levels and new client activity.Finally, expense of $5.7 billion was up 9% year-on-year, half being higher compensation expense, with a comp to revenue ratio of 29%, and the remainder primarily driven by higher transactions costs in markets.Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 7, another very good quarter in this business with net income of $1 billion and a ROE of 20%.
Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven primarily by higher management fees on growth in AUM as well as higher NII on deposit margin expansion and loan growth.
Adjusted, expense would have been up 8%, driven by higher external fees on revenue as well as higher compensation.For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $16 billion, including $5 billion in active equities, with strength across all regions benefiting from strong long-term performance.
We saw net liquidity outflows of $21 billion, largely driven by a combination of recent M&A activity and the impact of cash repatriation due to tax reform.AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were up 10% and 9%, respectively, on higher market levels globally as well as the inflows.
And so we wouldn't expect our behavior to change materially.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Michael Mayo -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystHi.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentHi.Michael Mayo -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystCan you just give a little bit more of your expectations for Consumer?
I'm wondering if you could give us some color on how the LIBOR changes impacted trading.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYeah.
How do you think about reserving and your expected loss rates going forward?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYeah.

53,jpmc,q2,2018,"Our return on tangible common equity was 17%, and also included in the results were two notable items, which I will call out in a moment, excluding which EPS would have been about $0.10 higher.The strength this quarter was broad-based across businesses, and highlights included average core loan growth excluding CIB of 7% year on year, consumer deposit growth of 5%, which we believe continues to outpace the industry, FOB sales up 11%, and client investment assets and merchant processing volumes each up 12%.
Net interest income was up $1.1 billion or 9%, reflecting the impact of higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower markets and II.
Credit costs of $1.2 billion were flat year on year and credit trends remain favorable across both Consumer and Wholesale.Shifting to balance sheet and capital on Page 3, we ended the second quarter with CET1 of 11.9%, up about 10 basis points versus the last quarter, and most of the capital generated was returned to shareholders.
Consumer and business banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion as well as deposit growth.
Treasury Services and Security Services revenue were each up 12%, driven by higher rates and deposit balances, and security services also benefited from higher asset-based fees on new client activity and higher market levels.
Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 7 basis points.Moving on to Asset and Wealth Management on Page 7, Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $755 million with a pre-tax margin of 28% and an ROE of 33%.
Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 4% year on year, driven by higher management fees on growth in long-term products as well as strong banking results.
Expense of $2.6 billion was up 6%, driven by continued investment in advisors and technology as well as higher external fees on revenue growth.For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $4 billion with positive flows across multi-asset equities and alternatives, partially offset by outflows in fixed income.
Finally, we had record loan balances up 12% with strength in global wholesale and mortgage lending.Moving to Page 8 and Corporate, Corporate reported a net loss of $136 billion.
I wanted to ask you what you're seeing this quarter in terms of consumer deposit trends with a little more color on both the pricing data and volume balances.
Looking forward, the overall pipeline remains strong.Moving on to Markets, total revenue was $5.4 billion, up 13% year on year or up 16% adjusting for the impact of tax reform, and was driven by strong results in equities, solid performance in FIT across categories, and with performance picking up in the second half of the quarter.
Fixed income markets revenue was up 12% adjusted on the backs of good client flow and decent volatility, and with commodities making a notable recovery from a challenging prior year.It was a record second quarter for Equities, with revenue up 24%, driven by strong client activity and favorable trading results, and with particular strength in cash, prime, and flow derivatives.
So, we are seeing our digital effort pay off, and even more broadly than that, we could go into QuickPay and Zelle and the like, but I wouldn't focus overly on FIN as isolated thing, but think digital more broadly.OperatorOur next question is from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.James Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystHey, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerMorning, Jim.James Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystMaybe just talk a little bit about loan growth.
What are you guys seeing on the ground, and do you think what we've seen so far is a good indicator for a more sustained pickup in growth?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerI would say that we would -- if you use the Commercial Bank C&I loans as a kind of bellwether, there has been decent demand, and I mentioned it in my remarks, but decent demand -- not exclusively, but partially on the back of a very robust and active M&A environment.
But, through the cycle, I think that we've proven that our business model will produce strong shareholder returns and among best-in-class performance.OperatorOur next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Mike.
So, while there are other factors weighing potentially on the 10-year in terms of still very accommodative central bank policy, particularly in the banks of Japan and the ECB, where obviously, trade is not necessarily constructive just in terms of the narrative, short-term underfunded pensions going into bumps -- there are some technicals, but fundamentally, what you're seeing in terms of the flattening is pretty typical of a tightening cycle, and as long as it's accompanied with solid to strong economic growth, it doesn't concern us at this point, and in fact, as we've been pointing out, we are still levered toward fund rates from a profitability perspective, and we do expect the curve to steepen over time.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Managing DirectorAll right, thank you.OperatorOur next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Glenn.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorHi. Just one follow-up on the competition conversation.
And, just an add-on to that -- I'm just curious if part of the competition has anything to do with the private credit market that seems to be growing pretty strongly.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerI would say just a tiny little correction -- our outlook was 6% to 7% core loan growth excluding the CIB.
Good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHi.Saul Martinez -- UBS Financial Services -- Managing DirectorSo, just following on the theme of economics and policy, to what extent do you see trade friction, geopolitical concerns, those things starting to impact client sentiment, whether it's institutional or corporate clients?
The European sovereignty situation -- so, there's just more catalysts in the market, and just generally, more client participation.OperatorOur next question is --Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSorry, to finish that to make sure that no one is confused, it was pretty broad-based, it was pretty consistent throughout the second half of the quarter, and it wasn't a lot of one-off large trades.OperatorAnd, our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorGood morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorJamie, I wanted to ask about the China investment.
Ultimately, I think it'll be good for China to have a company like J.P. Morgan equity, debt, credit, transparency, governance issues, inside China.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorBut right now, today, the ability to operate in Shanghai...?Jamie Dimon -- Chairperson and Chief Executive OfficerLook, we already do deposits and certain banking.
We just want the full capability.OperatorOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Managing DirectorGood morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Managing DirectorMarianne, can you share with us -- and, correct me if I'm wrong -- I think you guys have given us some color in the past about the impact of the Fed taking down their balance sheet over the next three to five years by a couple trillion dollars, that it will impact your deposit side of the balance sheet.
So, I'd say generally, terms are holding up quite well.Jamie Dimon -- Chairperson and Chief Executive OfficerOn the competition issue, I think it's good for the country -- the United States -- if we have a fully competitive card, mortgage, retail, asset management, commercial banking, investment banking, sales and train -- there are strong competitors everywhere.
Just wanted to get some color on that.Jamie Dimon -- Chairperson and Chief Executive OfficerThat was actually credit.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerCharge-offs -- so, in CIB, the charge-offs were driven by two names, and the principal one was the remaining piece of the Steinhoff loan that we sold this quarter.
We had a reserve release against it that was larger.OperatorOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Managing DirectorThank you.
Just a follow-up, Marianne -- on the capital return that you guys were approved for in terms of the share repurchase, is that going to be spread out evenly over the next four quarters, or will it be more front-end-loaded?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerWe haven't disclosed that, but if you look at our historical pattern, it's pretty even.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Managing DirectorVery good.
But, for us, the reason why it's pretty limited -- not to say there's no other impact, but the reason why it'll be mostly driven by the areas I mentioned is because in most of our wholesale space and so many of our other products, we are covered for multiple years, if not close to life-of-loan, at this point.OperatorOur next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerWow, we're popular today.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Managing DirectorYeah, I thought I'd join the party too.

54,jpmc,q3,2018,"On deposits, while we continue to benefit from the normalizing rate environment, as expected, balances are down year on year, bases are trending higher, and we are seeing some migration at the top end to higher-yielding investments.Expense of $853 million was up 7%, as we continue to invest in the business, in banker coverage, and technology initiatives.
Thank you.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, I would say -- I would pick up on the tone that you had in your question, which is the level of rates is not surprisingly high, and so, from our vantage point, we're not seeing anything in terms of looking at our client dialogue or, for that matter, at the credit trends that would suggest that this is problematic.
With higher rates -- and, we do this all the time -- we obviously look at all of our portfolios and stress them for shocks of up 100 basis points, even up 200, although, clearly, where we are now, risks are more symmetric.But, there doesn't seem to be any extraordinary stress that becomes evident, even if you -- obviously, at the margin, you're going to get more, but it doesn't seem to be overwhelming, and I think it speaks to the fact that low rates have been for a long time, people have had the chance to get prepared, there is a lot of liquidity, and in the corporate space in particular, people have been able to hedge.
So, I'm not saying that there couldn't be select downgrades, I'm not saying that at the margin, there may not be some incremental stress if rates continue to go much higher, but that's not where we are right now.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorOkay, thanks very much, Marianne.OperatorYour next question comes from Steve Chubak with Wolfe Research.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Executive DirectorHi, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerMorning, Steve.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Executive DirectorI wanted to start with a question on the You Invest launch.
And, it's really just our effort to understand the long-term strategy given that the pricing is quite competitive, but at the same time, the marketing effort has been fairly minimal so far.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerRemember, You Invest -- it's early.
Obviously, we have no crystal ball as to the timing in part of these things, but it is playing out arguably a little slower than we thought, but like we thought, and I would say that our outlook for deposit growth is for it to be slower, but still positive.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorGood morning, how are you?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerGood, how are you?Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorGood, good.
I know you've given guidance on that before, but given the sharp backup that we got over the last couple of weeks, how's that impacting your forward look on that?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerOn the asset side of the balance sheet, a big rule of thumb is a little less than half our loans are variable indexed to a primer LIBOR, so what we've been seeing -- in any one quarter, there can be noise on one-time items, mix, or whatever else, but largely speaking, for every rate hike we've been seeing on the front end, we're seeing our assets repriced about half of that.
So, I actually think that our outlook is still quite optimistic on the global economy, not to say -- to Jamie's point -- that there aren't some risks out there.And so, as we continue -- and also, just to talk about monetary policy for a second, everything -- given that growth outlook -- is lining up for a December rate hike, and for more hikes into 2019, and the continuation, hopefully, for a steeper yield curve, and that all should be constructive for bank stocks.
And, just as a follow-up, I picked up in part of your response to an earlier question, Marianne, as we think about your wholesale loan trends year over year, which continue to outpace the banking industry, could you tell us a little bit more about the dynamics in terms of competition from non-banks, particularly in private middle-market lending?
Marianne pointed out that wages are going up, participation is going up, credit has been pristine, housing is in short supply, confidence -- both small business and consumer -- is extraordinarily high, and that could drive a lot of growth for a while in spite of some of the headwinds out there.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerI also think -- not exactly, but if you went back and looked a couple of years ago what the two-year forward 10-year rate would look like, it would look much like this.
And, in the absence of giving you guidance, I would just point you to the fact that we're still targeting -- not targeting, but we're still expecting an overhead ratio to be around the mid-50s over the medium term, which, on revenue growth, implies we're going to continue to invest, and there's also volume-related costs associated with that.OperatorYour next question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein.John McDonald -- Sanford C.
And, just as a follow-up, I was just wondering how rising rates are affecting competition and capacity in the mortgage business, and whether the regulations in mortgage have made you open to reconsidering getting back into some areas that you exited after the crisis.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, mortgage being a cyclical business as it is, we are -- on higher rates -- expecting the overall market to be down about 10% year on year.
Obviously, refinances and new home sales will probably be down because of the rates a little bit.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd, you're right, there's excess capacity in the market right now, and that will clear -- it will clear itself out over the course of coming months, and we're in this for relationships, not volumes, and margins are under pressure as a result, but they will stabilize.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd, that is an area, by the way, where all the riskier lending has gone to non-banks, pretty much.OperatorYour next question comes from Al Alevizakos with HSBC.Al Alevizakos -- HSBC -- DirectorHi, thank you.
Sorry.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe risk the wallet will go down.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, I'd like to say on the margin point, it's been the case that particularly in the more liquid space, you've seen margins coming down consistently over the years, so it's not necessarily that this is some sort of step change or new phenomenon, but it's competitive, so that's what we're seeing.
Are you still seeing the same potential for growth in both the on-balance-sheet and the leases?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, on the loan side in auto, I would say that we are losing share as we face competition from credit unions and captives that may have economic frameworks that are different from ours.
We're very careful about how we think about residual risks and reserving on that portfolio, but it's very high-quality growth, and that looks set to continue.OperatorYour next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS.Saul Martinez -- UBS Investment Bank -- AnalystHi, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Saul Martinez -- UBS Investment Bank -- AnalystI just wanted to follow up on the question on operating leverage.
What are a couple reasons you'd just chalk it up to high level?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerIf you think about the -- we're gaining share most notably in cash and prime, and if you go back a number of years ago, we were pretty open and honest about the fact that we weren't where we needed to be in either of those two scenarios, and we have been consistently investing in the platform, and it is technology.
I also think that the relationship effects of having the equities business with our private bank and with the commercial bank -- the feedback loop -- is also quite powerful, so it has a little bit to do with our operating model, our platform as a company.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd really great research.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, great research.OperatorYour next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.Brian Kleinhanzl -- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods -- Managing DirectorThanks.
I know it's very early in the quarter, but with the trading volatility we've seen, any color that you can share with us on that as well.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, commercial loans -- we're 4% up year on year, flat to 1% up sequentially.
And so, while we don't overthink that and we do honestly think about economic capital, at some level, we have to generate a positive return for shareholders and shareholder value, and it's on these very high-credit-quality loans that we're producing, it's expensive.OperatorYour next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- DirectorThanks, and good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning, Marty.Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- DirectorI wanted to take a little bit of a different slant on deposit betas and just ask a three-part question.
Record net income for third quarter, even excluding the impact of tax reform, with key drivers being higher net interest income across businesses, reflecting continued rate normalization and solid growth in both loans and deposits, as well as very strong credit performance across all portfolios.
Highlights include average core loan growth excluding the CIB of 6% year on year, card and debit sales as well as clients' investment assets and merchant processing volumes in Consumer were all up double digits.
Net interest income was up $945 million or 7%, reflecting the impact of higher rates net of lower market NII as well as loan and deposit growth.
Non-interest revenue was up $425 million, driven by market NIR and higher auto lease income, partially offset by markdown on certain legacy private equity investments.Expense of $15.6 billion was up 7% year on year.
Chase also earned the No. 1 spot in customer satisfaction in the JD Power U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study.Client investment assets were up 14% as we saw clear record net new money flows, more than doubling year on year, with flows accounting for more than half of the growth.
Revenue of $13.3 billion was up 10%, consumer and business banking revenue up 18% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth.
Year on year, charge-offs were down $137 million, driven by a recovery from a reperforming loan sale in home lending this quarter of about $80 million together with an approximately $50 million charge-off adjustment in auto this period last year.Excluding those charge-offs, we're about flat, but we are seeing improvement across all portfolios except for card, and in card, while charge-offs are up as newer vintages season, they are up less than expected as credit performance remains very strong.
Finally, expense of $5.2 billion was up 8%, driven by higher legal expense, higher compensation expense as we invest in technology and bankers, and volume-related transaction costs.Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 6, another strong quarter for this business with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 21%.
Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year on year, driven by higher management fees net of fee compression on higher market levels and continued growth in long-term products.
Additionally, banking results are strong.Expense of $2.6 billion was up 7%, driven by continued investment in advisers and technology as well as higher external fees on revenue growth.
And, I'm wondering -- given your fairly strong results across the board -- where is the market wrong in terms of how they're thinking about either the economy or bank revenues related to a strong economy?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerI wanted to start by saying -- I mean, there's a lot of macro uncertainty, noise, and overhang that have been affecting the markets over the last few days, so overthinking any one driver or conclusion might be challenging.
",11.29,0.47023940000000003
55,jpmc,q4,2018,"And finally, as I said, we expect credit to remain favorable across products.So, to close, while the market in the fourth quarter were more challenging, we should not leave sight of the fact that 2018 was a strong year, indeed a record for revenues, net income and EPS, both reported and adjusted for tax reform.
We have good momentum coming into the year and the Company and each of our businesses are very well positioned.With that, operator, we can open up the line for Q&A.Questions and Answers:OperatorOur first question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystHi, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning, Erika.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystSo, the way Bank's stocks have performed, clearly, investors are starting to worry about revenue trends near-term and of course credit which you addressed.
I'm wondering if the revenue trends continue to be weaker than expected, if the overhead ratio of 57% that you posted in 2017 and 2018, is something that you could continue to level off to or will the investment horizon be more of a dominant factor when we're thinking about the overhead ratio?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
And I'm wondering how we should think about the dynamics of net interest income and more specifically net interest margin and deposit pricing if December was indeed the last rate hike for sometime?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo I would say, first of all, just to say that -- the question mark about whether that's a pause or a stop, is it the end of a cycle, we don't think so, we think the outlook for growth in the economy is still strong, the consumer is still strong and healthy and we're expecting to still see maybe slower but still global growth going forward.Having said that, just as a general matter, you've seen through our earnings at risk, as we have put more and more of the benefit at past rate hikes in our run rate each incremental hike from here has while still positive significantly lower sort of incremental NII drive and that the front end skew is a lower percentage.
Can that go higher from here as you maybe pull back on rewards?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I would say that, when we think about the product continually have in the constructs, rewards is a very important part of driving engaged relationships with our customers.
So we feel great that that kind of loss trend at that 310 basis points, maybe a little bit higher, is something we should look forward to at least into 2019 and it will be helped by a supportive macro environment.And we are seeing -- if you unpick all of our trends, you see the phenomenon of three vintages, you'd see the mature vintages that continue to be stable to grinding lower in terms of delinquencies and loss rates.
How much did you have to take in terms of maybe marks and leveraged loans and hung deals, a little bit of color there would be helpful.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.
And that's not to say that there is no deals that have the potential for there to be net losses after fees, but nothing that we would consider to be significant and nothing in the fourth quarter.I would also say that coming back to the first quarter, that actually the market could be quite constructive for fixed income into the first quarter given a more dovish Fed supporting corporate margin, corporate default rates is going to stay pretty low and we do have time.
Thank you very much.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo it's -- no good ever comes of talking about how we think things are going to pan out in the first quarter, other than just the general comments I've already made, which is the environment should be more constructive and we are expecting decent volatility in client activity and we'll see how that pans out.
And fixed income, we've maintained our share and we're adding products and services around the world and we don't know --Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd even gained share.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe don't know what's going to happen next quarter and I don't care.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd we take the same position, like we had strong first half of the year, and we said, loan may continue but it may not.
So in that role, what are you doing to help JPMorgan and I guess the other banks, in terms of China, the government shutdown, immigration, some of these headline issues that Marianne talked about having hurt the CIB in the fourth quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, so December is terrible, but if you look at January, you have half of it back, genuine spreads and markets and stuff like that.
In other words, things went down, spreads widened out, there was lots of fear, but it felt like the plumbing was working, but I don't want to put words in your mouth.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd half the people weren't even here the last two weeks in December.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerThat's right.
In our bridge book right now, we have, for the vast majority, we have good cushion and we expect to be able to clearing price through the market and for anything that's even borderline, it's completely not material.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think some of the field did have a few marks.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIf you look at what happened to flex pricing, like mid-December, when things were at their worst, yeah, some of these things were very close to the end of their flex pricing, and that means they're very close to having some kind of mark.
And do you get the impression that corporates had a general shift to seek borrowing from banks such as yourselves, because they were shut out of the market?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerI mean, there was an uptick at the end of the year, you saw in the industry data, we saw it in our spot data.
For us, in fact, it was largely driven by: one, investment grade loan that we extended at the end of the quarter, but there was a little bit of an uptick a little bit more in terms of acquisition financing on the balance sheet, but nothing I would call --James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer(inaudible)Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerNo. I want to circle back on the expense flexibility.
I guess, what I'm getting at is, last quarter, you had --James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe had pretty good model for it.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSorry, keep going.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystI guess what I'm getting at is, like it's -- are we at the point where like just a couple lumpy loans is going to drive a few hundred million reserve build or is it just -- maybe this is a bit unusual still?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, first of all, I just want to sort of point out that in the cards space, we hopefully continue to grow healthy mid-single digits.
There's the seasonality to cards balances and losses, so you typically see reserve builds in the second half of the year, that's what we saw this year and actually a little bit lower year-on-year than last.And in the wholesale space, you're going to see some things will be a bit lumpier and episodic given the nature of the loans that we have.
Is there any concern on your part that some of these issues have sort of a self-fulfilling effect in that, it does end up leading to actions that precipitate a downturn or a recession?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, I mean, I think that we would look to the sort of macroeconomic data, which is still generally supportive and say things should be good.
And in many of our businesses, we're going to protect profitability and credit discipline over growth at this point.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo let me just reemphasize that.
We tell our management that we have no problem seeing loan books shrink.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerCorrect.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe are not going to be sitting here ever in our lives and say you got to grow the loan book, you got to show loan growth.
I think you can have a logical conversation with kind of the non-bank loan book, but that's not our concern and it is what it is at the time, so --Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd I think where businesses are notably a little bit less relationship-driven, I think about kind of low loan new relationships, commercial term lending, real estate banking, mortgage, to a lesser degree, auto.
So, why would 1Q be a little bit different, I guess, is really the question.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. We had added more and more as the year progressed.
And then, outside of that, there's a bit more in real estate as we sort of execute on our head office strategy and then marketing, foundation completion, those things -- there are going to be timing.So the first quarter will be higher.
Thanks.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, so, I mean, it's fair to say that money market rates traded above IOER throughout the fourth quarter and more pronounced at the end of the quarter.
If you can just give us some color there what drove a negative gain on sale.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, so in the quarter, as we were looking at optimizing our balance sheet, we actually did a sale of conforming loans to the GSEs of about $5 billion.
But looking into January, again, if the market remains generally constructive, we should see tailwinds across the businesses.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think the intentional backlogs, generally, you want them high because that's good, but they're all like an accordion too, they come and go.
So our total reserves, what $14 billion?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, $14 billion and a bit.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, but at one point, they were $30 billion.
And even if it did, given the credit quality of the portfolios, performance will be not only absolutely better, but we think strong on a relative basis.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo other than if you look at the consumer that $13 trillion that's outstanding, other than student, which is fundamentally own by the government, the mortgage stuff that's been written is prime.
I think orders are about the same, but order actually outperformed in the --Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerThere's more prime.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes, more prime, and outperformed in the Great Recession.
I was just wondering, just any takeaways you had from reading that and any hopes you might have for just as we get toward some finalization of which way CECL goes and how it looks, aspirations around that and how that interacts with CCAR and such?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBefore Marianne answers that question, I just want to do a shout out to Jefferies, because we actually look at what everyone does and every investment banking group, and you guys did a hell of a good job in healthcare this year.Ken Usdin --  -- AnalystI'll pass that along, Jamie.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd following that -- it's hard to follow, I would say that we've been pretty clear about the fact that our biggest concern around CECL was like properly understanding not just for us but regulators to properly understand the implications for capital, not only in benign but in stressed scenarios, and what the implications of the outcome that it could have on the willingness of people to extend credit, particularly as cycles age and with the outlook for volatilities to increase.
And is that slowing down the Investment Banking business and your thoughts on that, please?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, I would say that we've been -- we benefited from the fact that year-end and into the early part of January and holiday season have a light calendar, typically in January for IPOs in particular.
Market impacts aside, underlying business drivers remain solid, including core loan and deposit growth, consumer sentiment and spending in a robust holiday season, capital market activity and with credit performance continuing to be very strong across businesses.
For the full year 2018, the firm reported revenue of $111.5 billion and net income of $32.5 billion, both clear records even adjusting for the impact of tax reform, and so we're entering 2019 with good momentum across our businesses.Turning to page two and some more detail about our fourth quarter results.
Non-interest revenue was down slightly with lower market levels impacting asset wealth management fees and private equity losses being offset by higher card fees and auto lease growth in CCB.
Revenue of $111.5 billion was also a record and was up nearly $7 billion or 7% year-on-year, $4.3 billion of which was higher net interest income on higher rates with growth and card margin expansion being offset by lower market NII.Non-interest revenue was up $2.5 billion or 5% driven by CIB markets and growth in Consumer, being offset by private equity losses and the impact of spread widening on SBA.
And although we are showing modest positive operating leverage on a managed basis, remember our revenues were impacted by lower growth results given tax reform.
Credit costs were $4.9 billion, down 8% driven by lower net reserve builds in Consumer as well as the impact in 2017 of student loan sale.Moving on to page four and balance sheet and capital.
And of note, while not a material driver of overall expense, revenue headwinds here were offset by lower net production expense.And Card, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 14% driven by higher card NII on both loan growth and margin expansion.
Expense of $7.1 billion was up 6% driven by investments in technology and marketing and auto lease depreciation, partially offset by lower FDIC charges and other expense efficiencies.On credit, net charge-offs were $18 million as modestly higher charge-offs in cards were more than offset by lower charge-offs in auto and home lending.
We maintained our number one rank for the year and continued to hold strong lead-left positions in high yield bonds and leveraged loans.Moving to market, total revenue was $3.2 billion, down 6% reported and down 11% adjusted for the impact of tax reform and slight in of margin loan loss last year.
Prime continued to do well, but we saw clients deleveraging over the course of the quarter and cash and derivatives are solid in a tougher environment.Treasury Services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13% driven by growth in operating deposits as well as higher rates, but also benefiting from fee growth on higher volumes.
Underlying this was strong fee growth and a modest benefit from higher rates, together being substantially offset by the impact of lower market levels and the business exit.
Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $243 million, reflecting higher funding spreads on our derivatives.Finally, expense of $4.7 billion was up slightly with continued investments in technology and bankers, and volume-related transaction costs, partially offset by lower FDIC charges and lower performance based compensation.
Revenue of $2.3 billion for the quarter was down 2% as the prior year included a tax reform related benefits, excluding its revenue was up 3% driven by higher deposit NII.
Underlying credit performance remains strong with credit costs of $106 million including higher loan loss reserves largely due to select client downgrades.Moving on to Asset & Wealth Management on page eight.
These were partially offset by strong banking results and the cumulative impact of net inflows.Expense of $2.6 billion was flat, as continued investments in advisors and in technology were offset by lower performance-based compensation and lower revenue-driven external fees.
But net-net, we're expecting a relatively stable loss rate that leveled similar to 2018.OperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHey, Saul.OperatorAnd I'm sorry, his line has disconnected.
We know the losses are going to go up.OperatorOur next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystAre we playing golf all day yet or is that still far away?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerCredit is pristine.
And we're completely aware of that.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAlthough I think we could say for obvious reasons that we wouldn't expect any near-term recession if there is one to look anything like it did before.
If we're embedding these assumptions into our stress tests and our results sooner than they are, how do we think about the implications of that on our distribution plans and capital outlooks.And importantly, if it really is the case that we have to upfront significant amounts of capital for longer term and lower credit quality loans, I do really believe even though the cash flows and the economics conceptually don't change that you might find people less willing to lean into growth for longer duration assets if there are concerns around potential volatility and we should worry about that.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd it'll be a big number for like credit card.
So I do think particularly smaller banks will react fairly dramatically on how they run their loan books to do that.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, our view is that more on that just needs to be done in the industry about what this looks like.
",24.82,0.5016059
56,jpmc,q1,2019,"We talked at Investor Day about the fact that we're always going to make the net investment -- the net incremental investment decision based on its own merit, but in total with the amount we're spending now and the amount of dollars that roll off every year that get repositioned for investments, we feel like we should see our net investment spend reach a reasonable plateau over the course of the next several years.And so, that is -- obviously a lot of the investments that we've been making in technology are also not only to do with customer service and risk management and revenue generation, but they are also to do with operating efficiency.
So, to me, it's a combination of all of the above and less so, at this point, a perception of flight to quality, the people have a lot of choices.Year-over-year, I would say, we're seeing deposit growth slow exactly in line with our expectations, but this year the slowdown speaks a little bit more as far as we can see to higher consumer spend and a little bit less to do with deposit flows out to rate-seeking alternatives.
It's decent, but our branch growth, the reason why we continue to believe in a physical and digital combined channel presence, both are important, but we can get back to you.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHi, thanks very much.
Talk about what type of business you are winning there.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, on the business exit, this is -- it's the sort of feature of always talking about year-over-year.
And I just wanted to...Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst...get a little qualifier of that.
And our risks are that all the things that we've always told you about, which are relatively modest, relatively senior, well secured, well diversified, we look at -- losses under a variety of such scenarios are manageable.The comments are really about the percentage of leverage lending or the percentage of some of our businesses that have now been taken outside of the banking market.
So, I didn't hear the second part of the question on losses, which losses were up this year that you were mentioning, but here is what I would say.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThe Card and Auto losses.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
Net-net, it doesn't change our point of view that as we're at 12.1% CET1 right now, so arguably little bit above the high end of our range and continuing to grow earnings that we ought to be able to distribute a significant portion of earnings, but we always invest in our businesses first.So, we are growing our businesses responsibly every time we're adding branches, we're adding customers, we're adding advisors across our businesses.
But to the degree that we have excess earnings, we'll continue to distribute them and the ranges that we gave you at the end of February, nothing changed.OperatorNext question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- AnalystHi. Good morning, Marianne.
I got that, but I mean just a little bit of additional color perhaps?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
Or was there a one-off impacting that number this quarter?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerSo, you may recall that we did a mortgage loan sale last quarter and realized -- and there's geography.
It's just that each year (technical difficulty) and we'll continue to make the right decisions, and we see that being flatter going forward than it has been.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerAnd we're getting more efficient.
Thank you.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYes. So first point on Treasury Services, obviously, revenue growth was in double digits, you're right, this quarter (inaudible) year-on-year.
And so that just given where rates have moved headwind this year as the segment results are reported, but for the Company it's obviously net zero.The more important point is that organic growth underlying all of that balances and payments is holding up very well and we do expect that to continue.
So we feel good about the underlying organic growth in the business.With respect to technology spend, you'll recall last year we were kind of 60-40 run the bank, change the bank, and it's more 50-50 this year, so $11.5 billion of spend about half and half.Alevizos Alevizakos -- HSBC -- AnalystThank you very much.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerRemember, in the change of the bank, it runs the whole gamut from platforms and controls to customer experience, digital, data, R&D, so it's the whole spectrum.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGood morning.
One is small but nevertheless is arguably non-recurring, which is -- we've talked about the fact that overall in the Company when we do these loan sales that net-net there may be a small residual gain or loss that resides in Treasury, and it was a small gain in the first quarter in NII, call it, $50 million (ph) approximately.And then, in addition, we talked in the fourth quarter about the fact that we were seeing the opportunity to deploy cash in short duration liquid investments that were high-yielding than IOER that continued into the first quarter.
The curve is flat and we'll continue to manage the overall environment and company as we see the economy unfold.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay, thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America -- AnalystYes, hi, good morning.
And I'm wondering as we look at a tick-up in non-accrual loans in the Corporate & Investment Bank for the past two quarters, are we just in the part of the cycle where we're just growing from a low base or should we expect a step-down in the second quarter in non-accruals similar to how we saw last year?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerThere are a couple of situations that we would expect to maybe not be present in the second quarter, but I would say it's a feature more of extremely low base.
Marianne, just if I could ask you, you mentioned that there are some signs that the economy is strengthening, and I wanted to just ask you to can you split that between just what you're seeing on the Consumer side versus the Wholesale corporate side in terms of -- the spend numbers are obviously still double-digit year-over-year.
And then there is this unevenness about just CapEx and spending and corporate side, so just -- could you just kind of walk us through just where you're seeing pockets of relative strength and improvement?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I mean I think that as it relates to US and in particular looking at the US Consumer, you've got all of jobs more recently, auto, housing, spend all generally encouraging and holding up well and robust.
And one follow-up just on Investment Banking business, you had mentioned that the pipelines look good and obviously we've seen the reopening of the ECM market.
Right now, that's constructive for corporate deposit margins, constructive for credit, and generally constructive for how we're positioned on the balance sheet.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystIt's still you like you have room to, I guess, extend duration to kind of protect NII and NIM if that would happen?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYes, yes, we do.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystOkay.
How sustainable the results are?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerSo, first of all, just sort of big pic, first of all, really high I think is a bit of an overstatement -- higher, I think is fair.
Also on the page, total assets are up over $100 billion quarter-on-quarter, principally driven by higher CIB trading assets, in part a normalization from lower levels at the end of the year given market conditions.Lower end-of-period loans are partially offset by treasury balances, including higher securities.
And Cards, Merchant Services and Auto revenues was up 9%, driven by higher Card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and higher auto lease volumes.Expense of $7.2 billion was up 4%, driven by investments in the business and auto lease depreciation, partly offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.
We ranked number one in announced dollar volumes and gained nearly 100 basis points of wallet share.Debt underwriting fees were up 21%, also outperforming a market that was down, driven by large acquisition financing deals and our continued strong lead-left positions in leverage finance.
Finally, credit costs of $90 million were predominantly driven by higher reserves from select client downgrades and net charge-offs were only 2 basis points on strong underlying performance.Before we move on, I want to address the perceived gap between our reported C&I growth statistics and those that we will see in the Fed weekly data.
So while it's true that the Fed data is showing strong growth year-on-year and apples-to-apples (inaudible) mainstream middle market lending space, we're seeing good mid-single digit demand in line with our expectations.Moving on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7.
AUM of $2.1 trillion and overall client assets of $2.9 trillion were both record up 4%, driven by cumulative net inflows in the liquidity and long-term products and with first quarter market performance nearly offsetting fourth quarter declines.Deposits were up 4% sequentially on seasonality and down 4% year-on-year, reflecting continued migration into investments although decelerating as we continue to capture the vast majority of these flows.
Just kind of wondering what's driving that, is there any kind of cresting of investment spend that's going to occur in 2020 or is this kind of positive operating leverage carrying through?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
And even with these revenue pressures, we're focused on continuing to drive efficiencies, and these are good ROE businesses above mid-teens.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystAppreciate.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerI'm sorry.
It should be something that should be watched, but it's not a systemic issue at this point.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystI had a question for Jamie.
Great, thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystGood morning, Marianne.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystCan you share with us -- obviously you've got your de novo branching strategy moving forward.
Nominal dollars has now kind of stabilized versus what it was like again in the past five years?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerSo, I just want to reiterate something that I want to make sure you guys completely internalize, which is, we believe given the level of spend and the continued efficiency we're getting out of each dollar of spend that overall our net investment should be more flat going forward than they have in the past, but we will continue to look at every investment on its own merit.
Because if you annualize it, you're already above the full year target at $58 billion plus and obviously there's day count drag this quarter and really just puts and takes with rates and balance sheet growth, but it seems like the guidance is conservative versus where you're at right now.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerOkay.
You clearly seem more positive on the macro, and obviously things can change there, but are you approaching from the balance sheet management a little bit differently, given may be more positive macro outlook?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerWell, so, I mean, we only spoke to you most recently about six weeks ago.
And do banks have room to actually lower deposit costs if the rate curve stays this way for a prolonged period of time?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerSo, I'll just put the big contextual answer will always be the same, which is, when we think about our strategy around deposits and deposit pricing, it is 100% driven by what we're observing in our consumer behavior than what we're seeing in deposit flows.
But had it been a little bit of an air pocket here partially probably because of the soft fourth quarter, but how is that side of the business you're feeling and sounding from a backlog perspective?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
How do you think the balance sheet reacts and NII reacts to a potential for rate cut over the next 12 months?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerRight.
Thanks a lot.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerGood morning, Marty.Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- AnalystThanks for taking the question.
And if you can give some color maybe on the quarters ahead speaking to companies' CEOs (inaudible) emerging again.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYes. So that's impacting mortgage loans.
So my following question is on...Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerBefore you go into that there are going to be other areas where we just won't (inaudible).
",22.65,0.77309847
57,jpmc,q2,2019,"[Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak.
Underlying performance for the quarter was strong with highlights including client investment assets in consumer banking up 16%, largely driven by net new money flows; in card, 11% growth in sales and 8% growth in outstanding;  No. 1 in global IBCs year to date, gaining share across all products and regions; steady results in the commercial bank with net income of $1 billion, while continuing to invest in the business; and in asset and wealth management, record long-term inflows, AUM and client assets.
Revenue of $29.6 billion was up 1.2 billion or 4% year on year as net interest income was up approximately 900 million or 7% on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher rates.
Excluding that variance and the other offsetting notable items I mentioned, noninterest revenue was about flat with strong performance in consumer across auto lease, home lending production and consumer and business banking, offset by lower markets revenue and IB fees as previously guided.
Expenses of 16.3 billion were up 2% related to continued investments in our businesses, partially offset by a reduction in FDIC charges of approximately 250 million.
And in wholesale, credit performance remained favorable with a net charge-off rate of 8 basis points, which was fully reserved for in prior quarters.
Home lending was down 17%, although excluding the MSR adjustment I just mentioned, revenues would have been up 4% driven by higher net production revenue on better margins and higher volumes, largely offset by lower NII on spread compression and lower balances.
Expenses of 7.2 billion were up 4%, driven by continued investments in the business and higher auto lease depreciation, largely offset by efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.
Fixed income markets was down 3% on an adjusted basis, with relative weakness in EMEA, partially offset by increased client activity in North America rates and agency mortgage trading due to the changing rate environment.
Revenue of 2.2 billion was down 5% year on year, predominantly driven by lower investment banking activity due to our outperformance last year and lower NII on slightly lower deposit balances.
CRE loans were up 2% with modestly higher activity in commercial term lending where clients are taking advantage of lower long-term rates, offset by declines in real estate banking where we continue to be selective given where we are in the cycle.
Revenue of 3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year on year as the impact of higher average market levels was offset by lower investment valuation gains.
Expenses of 2.6 billion were up 1% year on year as continued investments in advisors and technology were partially offset by lower distribution fees.
Revenue was 322 million, up 242 million year on year due to higher net interest income, driven by higher rates and balance sheet mix, partially offset by net losses on legacy private equity investments versus net gains in the prior year.
It simply does not make sense to own all mortgages when you can frame by standardizing and can't securitize.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got It. OperatorOur next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. So the efficiency ratio went from 56 to 55% year over year, and I guess that's with some accelerated tech spending.
OperatorOur next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Hi. How did you approach the CCAR plan this year in relation to your long-term CET1 target of 11 and 12 that you talked about?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
So we've got much better at digital only, but we got it separated from the physical branch system.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, the digital account opening is now about 25% of our new account activity.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And we'll be doing in small business and merchant processing and all these various things.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst Got It. Thanks very much.OperatorOur next question is from Eric Compton of Morningstar.Eric Compton -- Morningstar -- Analyst Good morning.
The refact rate, embedded data centers are getting better in AI, all these things are in those numbers.OperatorAnd we have no further questions at this time.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, thank you very much.
And do you think how sustainable is it, 8% year-over-year growth?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
Should we expect just sort of you to continue to reduce the mortgage footprint in this rate environment?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So on the mortgage business, I would say, it was a good quarter on the back of the rally, and so we did see volumes increase and we saw some margin expansion as well, and so obviously highly rate dependent.
But importantly, I would say, we're not going to lose any valuable customer relationships over a few ticks of beta, and so we'll see how it goes.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It's all embedded with your assumption.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And it's all embedded in --Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it.
Should we think about this as part of the overall, you're saying optimizing capital and liquidity, and therefore, as we think about it going forward, we could also expect to see perhaps some release in RWA growth and some release in the continued reserve release as part of the optimization?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
Having said that, on reserves, I mean reserves are not necessarily going to be impacted directly by that because of course that will depend on the environment and the mix of the portfolio that remains.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And I would just say that our standardized capital ratio is a 12.2%, advanced is 13%.
We're going to do it regardless of the environment, and we'll try to get more efficient in tech spend, too.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right, and our investments in technology create capacity in terms of productivity to continue to invest and we've talked a lot about AI, machine learning.
It's early innings there and there is a lot that we're going to be able to do assuming that's there and become more productive and then cloud -- developers can become more productive using the cloud.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Look, it's amazing, our forward costs with all the things around the world today are down because of techniques with AI and big data and stuff like that.
Can you tell us either size of loan sales or what average loan growth was up year on year without that?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So yes, there's a few things going on in loan growth, as you say it, Glenn.
Or are you doing anything actively to manage that lack of mix shift?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So as I said, we are seeing balances stabilize in the commercial bank and AWM.
In other words, if we think about if the ongoing rate in current environment persists into next year after the two or three cuts this year, are we looking at a billion, or is it way too complex to oversimplify like that?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it's probably more complicated, Glenn.
So we can expect that to continue.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Is it more the market -- as you just referenced the retail sales, they were strong, is it more that or are you guys also seeing gains in market share that gives you an added boost?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, we have taken share in -- a little bit of share in card.
So we're going to take and give our clients more and better advancement cheaper all the time, and now we package that with Sapphire Banking or Sapphire card or discounts and mortgages that are not always made to be seen, but the future is very bright because if we can do more for our customers, that's a very good thing.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And don't forget, on credit cards, you get charge-back rights and you get flows.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Right.
And so as I said in the presentation, we've had over 60 million Chase offers activated and so this is really powerful and benefits not just our consumers, but our large merchant clients at zero cost to us.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst So a message of more efficient, less cost maybe needs to get heard on the hill as well.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, and we talked about it a lot of time and a lot of people understand that, and of course we always want to do a better job for our consumers, which we have been referring.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Yeah.
Is there something or is there an offer that you have for them or are you considering that because that I'm just thinking about where fintech is trying to exploit you and I know it's a catchphrase under-banked that is being used by Libra, it doesn't necessarily to me seem like it's solving anything for them, but maybe you've got a better solution that we just don't focus on.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, so we have --  some of the stream in Chase we have 25% of branches around my neighborhoods.
We think we'll do a great job for them and when they do have complaints, we'll fix it.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right.
And Jen, did you say what the amount of the gains that you had on the loan sales this quarter?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Just if you get a higher return on REIT body, you get IOER, you're going to do that.
If you get a higher return using standardized capital on securities or on home loans, you're going to do that, and that's what we're seeing in some of these banks.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right.
And you said earlier, you would have cut back on technology, but are other areas in expenses, you think about managing the balance sheet and liquidity a little bit different?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
We will always continue to invest in the things that we think are important, but we would have that opportunity depending upon the opportunity to take a look at that.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Remember, in a real recession, there are always opportunities to reduce your costs and vendors pull all those themselves, they will give you better deals and stuff like that.
Is it your expectations that you will use it all or is that still to be determined based on balance sheet growth, stock price and the environment?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer I would say still to be determined.
And as you know it's over four quarters, and so we have time to think about it, but obviously, we have the flexibility.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Is the timing of that even, or is there a flexibility there, too?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It has been in the past, but we can change that every day.OperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst Hey, good morning.
",35.38,0.75973314
58,jpmc,q3,2019,"And curious if you think we need changes in the structure of the markets to function better on a go-forward basis.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So if I remember correctly, you got to look at the concept of -- we have a checking account at the fed with a certain amount of cash in it.
JPMorgan declined -- in any event, it's about how the regulators want to manage the system and who they want to intermediate when the time comes.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And it's worth noting, Glenn, that the overall impact to JPMorgan from the events in mid-September was not material one way or another to our third-quarter results.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Yes. OK.
But the fourth quarter of '19 in terms of run rate is not a bad place to start.OperatorOur next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi, good morning.
Is it going to be something that we're not going to see in the revenues because it's too small to matter to you?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I couldn't say.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. But like I said, we will be managing and fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket.
As you think about the cross current of resolution planning, LCR, and liquidity stress testing, could you help us -- what is the level of excess deployable cash at JPMorgan?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I said we have $120 billion in our checking accounts with the fed, and it goes down to $60 billion and then back to $120 during the average day.
So that's what I was referring to.In terms of investment securities, when you look at the increase this quarter, there's a few things going on.
And so we have realized significant productivity to date in not only in our technology investments, but other investments and think still have room to run.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer As you said, in our merchant processing systems, and API store for the CIB.
And maybe at Investor Day, we can go a little bit more into how we try to manage the technology budget.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I'd like to just -- and then our call centers, Mike, we don't necessarily think about it just in terms of the number of people.
But we're always making sure that the people in our call centers and the overall productivity of the call center is increasing.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. And with all the cyber stuff you read about, our fraud in cards and consumers come down, not gone up because of some of these deployed technologies in call centers.
And how you're thinking about that going forward?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
And is it possible that you can continue to grow that?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So I mean, there's no doubt that the business will be impacted by rate headwinds, as the implieds play out.
But did you get a little bit more traction on lowering those rates as you went into the -- going into the fourth quarter?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer OK.
And then when you sold the loans this quarter, those mortgage loans, and replaced them with securities, was that related to liquidity or just the decisioning process on that?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So the loan decision is because we are at standardized capital now, which I think, by the way, risk -- I mean, the advance is far more important, and we should probably report more than that because that's 13%.
Volcker is a slightly different thing.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And then, Marty, I think you asked about fourth quarter.
But with all this mixing into your last point there about where the deposit margin pressure comes in, do you expect the constitution of deposit growth to change at all, whether it comes from the consumer business, wholesale or the wealth management complex?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
But fourth quarter is a seasonally high quarter for us, and so we still expect to hit that 11 50%, plus or minus, for the full-year guidance, so just seasonality.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And that's -- and the thing I'd add here, it doesn't have the same compression that it does in deposits.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. That's one to follow-up on.
And how much of a swing factor is the duration change that you did in the third quarter helping that?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So I mean, we're doing that based on the latest implieds.
So I think it's important to take it with a health warning that's on the latest implied because that is, of course, what we know.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And it's assuming some balance sheet growth, as opposed to all things being equal.
That would be worse.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right.
Is there a way to kind of break out what was the impact of the potential marks on investments versus true equity trading revenues?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
Or do you plan on doing that prior to the adoption date?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Well, as we said at Investor Day, the range is $4 billion to $6 billion.
Is that in these numbers in 3Q or that comes in, in 4Q?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer That was in prime balance I think you're referring to.
Underlying performance continue to be strong with highlights including client investment assets in consumer banking, up 13%; strength in our consumer lending businesses, in particular on higher origination volume in home lending and auto; and healthy growth in sales and outstandings in card; No. 1 in global IB fees year to date with over 9% wallet share and record growth IB revenues in middle market; and in asset and wealth management, we saw record AUM and client assets.
SC sales loans were up 3% on healthy growth in card and AUM.Total deposits were up 5%, with strength across wholesale and retail, and credit performance remained strong across business.
Record revenue of $30.1 billion was up $2.2 billion or 8% year on year as net interest income was up $293 million or 2% on balance sheet growth and mix, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates.
Noninterest revenue was up $1.9 billion year on year or 14%, driven by strong performance across fixed income markets and consumer lending, which included a gain on mortgage loan sales of approximately $350 million.
CCB generated net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32% with continued deposit growth and total loans down 4% year on year.
In consumer and business banking, we saw strong deposit and investment growth year on year with deposits up 3% and client investment assets up 13%, reflecting continued growth across both physical and digital channels.
Home lending revenue was up 12% on higher production volumes and margins, partially offset by lower NII on lower balances, which were down 12%, reflecting loan sales.
Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 4% year on year, driven by continued investments and higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.
It was a record third quarter for investment banking fees, driven by strong performances in debt and equity underwriting, partially offset by lower advisory.
Equity derivatives performance was challenged by lower client activity and unfavorable market conditions, but prime remained strong and cash outperformed relative to the prior year.
Expenses of $5.3 billion were up 3% compared to the prior year with investments and higher revenue-related expenses partially offset by lower litigation and FDIC charges.
Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year on year with lower NII, driven by lower deposit margin, partially offset by higher non-interest revenue due to strong investment banking performance.
Gross investment banking revenues were $700 million, up 20% year on year on increased M&A and equity underwriting activity, and we saw revenues increase for both large deals and flow business with a record quarter in middle market.
Expenses of $881 million were up 3% year on year as investments in the business were largely offset by lower FDIC charges.
AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets was $3.1 trillion, both record, were up 8% and 7%, respectively, driven by cumulative net inflows into long term and liquidity products, as well as higher market levels.
Revenue was $692 million, up $795 million year on year, primarily due to higher net interest income driven by higher balances and balance sheet mix, as well as the funding offset from the lower mortgage loan sale that I mentioned earlier, all of which was partially offset by lower rates.
Could you give us a little bit more color on how you're expecting those dynamics to play out, particularly given slightly lower core loan growth this quarter and a 22% increase in investment securities balances?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
So there's a few things going on in investment securities this quarter.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer In some cases, securities at a higher return on standardized capital than certain mortgage loans did.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. So how much of that lower expense guidance is due to the deployment of technology?
And so we feel great about the continued growth there, but we won't be immune to rate headwinds.OperatorOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Can you guys give us some additional color on the investment banking backlog that you may have at the end of the third quarter?
",44.21,0.82456374
59,jpmc,q4,2019,"We will now go live to the presentation, please standby.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak.
And in wholesale, we were up $504 million, largely due to reserve releases and higher recoveries both in 2018.Moving to the balance sheet and capital, on Page 4; we ended the fourth quarter with the CET1 ratio of 12.4%, up slightly versus last quarter.
Revenue of $3.7 billion for the quarter was up 8% year-on-year as the impact of higher investment valuations and average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were partially offset by deposit margin compression.Expenses of $2.7 billion were up 1% year-on-year.
And just one question on just the volume side of things, ex the mortgage loans, sales last year, you were still in that like 3% core growth and obviously you talk a lot about this, the environment and how there's been some settling out, but at a lower level.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.OperatorOur next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystHi, good morning.Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Erika.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystSo, I was hoping to get a little bit more credit on what happened in the quarter to produce such stellar results.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSo look, on the efficiency ratio, I would say that, we run the Company with great discipline, whether it's relentlessly pursuing expense efficiencies or investing with discipline through the cycle.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi Mike.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystIs Jamie on the call?Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystI'm sorry?Jennifer A.
Is this something that you expect to remain or is this a one-off quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, that's a hard question, Mike.
But for how long that continues, we don't know.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystAnd then, Jennifer, you mentioned expense growth was 3%, it should be less than that this year.
Yes, we -- I mean there will be more disclosure about CECL in the Q for the first quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWhich means all the banks will be showing these ridiculous forecasting going forward and the differences and we'll spend time talking about that as opposed to the actual business.Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.OperatorOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystHi Jennifer.Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystA question on credit, you obviously put up some really good numbers, once again, on credit quality and I noticed that you had a nice material decline in the wholesale non-performing assets quarter-to-quarter.
Jamie, I don't know if there is anything you want to add?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo, you said it all.OperatorOur next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystHi, good morning.
And then in CRE, good growth in commercial term lending as we continue to have opportunity there, given the rate environment and then that is offset by real estate banking where we are very disciplined, given where we are in the cycle.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would just add.
We think that's the most secure way to do it.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBut very importantly, is that, that data is the data the customer agrees to give them on the basis they agree to give it to them is not unlimited access to customer data and the customer will have the ability to turn it off as opposed to today, if you gave you bank passcode to someone, they're taking your data every day, maybe even every minute and you don't even know about it because you forgot.Jennifer A.
Deposit growth accelerated in the fourth quarter across Consumer and Wholesale with average balances up 7% year-on-year.We saw solid loan growth with Card and AWM being the bright spots as average loans across the Company were up 3% year-on-year, excluding the impact of home lending loan sales from prior quarters.Client investment assets in Consumer & Business Banking were up 27% and Asset and Wealth Management, AUM, was up 19%, reflecting stronger market performance versus the prior year as well as organic growth.
We ranked Number one for the full year in global IB fees with 9% wallet share and growth IB revenue in the Commercial Bank was a record $2.7 billion.In CIB markets, we were up 56% year-on-year compared to a weak fourth quarter last year.
Revenue of $29.2 billion was up $2.4 billion or 9% year-on-year with net interest income down $220 million or 2% on lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB Markets NII.
Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.4 billion, down $121 million or 8% year-on-year, reflecting modest net reserve releases and net charge-offs in line with expectations.Turning to the full-year results on Page 3; the firm reported net income of $36.4 billion with EPS of $2.72 and revenue of $118.7 billion, all records and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 19%.
Revenue was up $7.2 billion or 6% year-on-year with net interest income up $2.1 billion or 4% on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher average short-term rates, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates.
Non-interest revenue was up $5.1 billion or 9%, driven by growth across Consumer and higher CIB markets revenue and expenses of $65.5 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued investments as well as volume and revenue-related costs, partially offset by lower FDIC charges.Revenue growth and our continued expense discipline generated positive operating leverage for the full year.
In the fourth quarter, CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31% with accelerating deposit growth of 5%, client investment assets up 27% and total loans down 6%.
Fourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, up 3% year-on-year.In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was down 2%, driven by deposit margin compression, largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher non-interest revenue on the increasing client investment assets as well as account and transaction growth.
Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 2%, driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business, including market expansion, largely offset by expense efficiencies.On Credit, this quarter's CCB had a net reserve release of a $150 million.
Net charge-offs were $1.4 billion largely driven by card and consistent with expectations.Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 7; for the fourth quarter, CIB reported net income of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.5 billion, a strong finish to the year.
Equity underwriting fees were up 10% year-on-year, reflecting strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America.The new issuance market continue to be active, and for the year we ranked number one in equity underwriting as well as IPOs. Our overall pipeline continues to be healthy and strategic dialogs with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the rate environment is favorable for debt issuance.Moving to markets; total revenue was $5 billion, up 56% year-on-year, driven by record fourth quarter revenues in both fixed income and equity markets.
Expenses of $5.2 billion were up 12% compared to the prior year with higher legal, volume and revenue related expenses, as well as continued investment.Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 8; Commercial Banking reported net income of $938 million and an ROE of 16% for the fourth quarter, and for the year $3.9 billion of net income and an ROE of 17%.
CRE loans were up 1% where we continue to see higher originations in commercial term lending, driven by the low rate environment, offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle.Finally, credit costs were $110 million and NPL rate of 17 basis points, largely driven by single names which was reserved for in prior quarters.
And as a reminder, the effective tax rate in the first quarter is typically impacted by stock compensation adjustments, and as a result, it's currently estimated to be approximately 17% since the managed tax rate is about 500 basis points to 700 basis points higher.So to wrap up; 2019 was a year of record financial performance across revenue, net income and EPS.

60,jpmc,q1,2020,"As you heard, Jamie is with me on the call, and I know I speak for the entire company when I say we are just thrilled that he's back.Before we get into the first quarter performance, we want to start by recognizing that this is an extremely challenging time for all of us and our thoughts are with those most affected by COVID-19, particularly those on the frontlines of this crisis.The presentation this quarter is slightly longer to address a few key topics as we navigate this environment, and as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.Starting on Page 1, I'd like to highlight some of the ways we're responding to COVID-19.
And at a high level, these items are a credit reserve build of $6.8 billion, approximately $950 million of losses in CIB, largely due to the widening of funding spreads on derivatives, and a $900 million markdown on our bridge book.It might be an obvious point that the quarter was really a tale of two cities: January and February, and then March when the crisis started to unfold.
Revenue of $29.1 billion was down $782 million or 3% year on year, and net interest income was flat to the prior year due to the impact of lower rates, offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB Markets NII.
This reserve increase assumes in the second quarter that U.S. GDP is down approximately 25% and the unemployment rate rises above 10%, followed by solid recovery over the second half of the year.In addition to these macro assumptions specific to each business, our consumer reserve build reflects our best estimate of the impact of payment relief that we are providing to our customers as well as the federal government stimulus programs.And in wholesale, the majority of the build is in sectors most directly impacted by COVID-19, such as in consumer and retail and also in oil and gas.
And on the small business side, we saw significantly reduced inflows in merchant processing activity, early signs of pressure on payment and delinquency rates as well as line utilization, and increased demand for credit.Turning back to the results, revenue of $13.2 billion was down 2% year-on-year.
Based on the latest implies and what we know today, we expect to see further pressure from rates, partially offset by balance sheet growth and CIB Markets NII, which results in NII of about $55.5 billion for the full year.
In addition to the two significant items in the first quarter, these headwinds included a $3.5 billion decrease in non-interest revenue, all else equal, which is also due to the impact of rates and as we offset the higher CIB Markets NII, and therefore revenue neutral.
And, how we should think about the significant government intervention relative to the severely adverse scenarios, I believe, for total losses of 5.9% over nine quarters for the Fed and 4.1% for company run?Jennifer A.
And so, we think we have significant room to continue to serve our customers and clients through this crisis, but we are managing it quite carefully and looking at a range of scenarios, so we make sure that we're prepared.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo & Company -- AnalystHi, and welcome back, Jamie.
It's just important to note that that kind of gives you a frame of how to think about it, but there's a lot more that goes in to our reserving, including management judgment about some -- like, world-class risk management and finance people and also other analytics.
But there, we did think about a number of other scenarios that we should contemplate in reserving and we also thought about the impact, what's our best estimate of the impact of these extraordinary government programs as well as our own payment relief programs.Since then, as I noted in my prepared remarks, our economists have updated their outlook and now have GDP down 40% in the second quarter and unemployment 20%.
But maybe thinking about it a little bit differently in terms of how to attribute the CECL reserve builds, and we're not looking for specific numbers, more just directional.
And like I said, we didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it and I would say that it is our best estimate of the losses that will inevitably emerge through this crisis.
And as I said earlier, it is probably the only thing we know for sure is that that is going to change through time, but it is a recovery in the back half of the year that doesn't get us back to where we started.
So, we'll see where we land at the end of the quarter, but so far --James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJust basing, marking the positions to market effectively.Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. But, as Jamie said, they're mark-to-market at the end of the quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I would just also put this in perspective; we're adults, we know that we have a bridge loan book that you're going to have quarters where things get bad and you might lose some money.
Because like I said, all else equal, given the macroeconomic outlook that we're looking at, that we would expect to have a build in the second quarter and perhaps beyond.
But we need some time to learn.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd also, just to add on the wholesale side, kind of at one point you have an overlay about what you expect in terms of migration downward and downgrades and stuff like that.
And there we, based upon our judgment and experience in the past, we apply some percentage of pull through in the portfolio of people who will get payment release, and then we think about the impact that that could have.Again, I would say, both, while estimated for the first quarter, we'll know a whole lot more about both of them for the second quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd, Jen, remind me, when we do the 10-Q for the quarter, we're going to lay out lots of these various assumption about CECL.
And to help the most vulnerable and hardest hit communities, as an initial step, we've announced $150 million loan program to get capital to underserved small businesses and non-profits, as well as a $50 million philanthropic investment.Now, turning to Page 2 for highlights on our first quarter financial performance.
And in Markets, volatility drove elevated trading volumes across products, most notably across rates and commodities, which at their peak were more than triple our average January trading volumes.And on the far right, deposit growth accelerated meaningfully in March, most notably driven by wholesale clients as they secured liquidity and held those higher cash balances with us.
In consumer and business banking, revenue was down 9% driven by deposit margin compression, partially offset by strong deposit growth of 8% that accelerated in the quarter.Deposit margin was down 56 basis points year-on-year and we expect it to decline further, given the current rate environment.
Average Card loan growth was 8% with sales up 4% over the quarter, driven by January and February activity.Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 3% driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business, partially offset by structural expense efficiencies.And lastly on this slide, credit costs included the $4.5 billion reserve build I mentioned earlier and net charge-offs of $1.3 billion driven by Card and consistent with prior expectations.Now, turning to the Corporate and Investment Bank on Page 8.
Wholesale Payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 4% year-on-year, driven by reporting reclassification in Merchant Services.As clients focused on preserving liquidity, we experienced higher deposit levels in Wholesale Payments throughout the quarter, offsetting revenue headwinds from lower rates and payments activity.
Market volatility drove increased transaction volumes and deposit balances which offset the impact of the market correction on asset balances.In Wholesale Payments and Security Services, tailwinds from this quarter, like elevated deposit balances, maybe relatively short-lived and more than offset by the impact of low rates and potentially lower transaction volumes If the crisis is elongated.Credit Adjustments and Other was a loss of $951 million, which was one of the significant items that I mentioned upfront.
While we remain confident in our long-term target, we expect some softness in our pipeline, specifically related to M&A and equity underwriting.Expenses of $988 million were up 5% year-on-year, consistent with the ongoing investments we discussed in Investor Day. Deposits were up 39% year-on-year on a spot basis and increased about $40 billion during the month of March, with about half of that coming from clients drawing on their credit lines and holding their cash with us as they look to secure liquidity.End of period loans were up 14% year-on-year, mainly driven by increases in C&I loans in March.
Higher origination in commercial term lending, driven by the low rate environment, were partially offset by declines in Real Estate Banking as we remain selective.Credit costs of $1 billion, included the reserve build I mentioned, and $100 million of net charge-offs largely driven by oil and gas.Now, onto Asset and Wealth Management on Page 10.
These increases were largely offset by lower investment valuations.Expenses of $2.7 billion were flat year-on-year with higher investments in the business as well as increased volume and revenue related expenses offset by lower structural expenses.Credit costs were $94 million, driven by reserve builds from the impact of COVID-19 as well as loan growth.
At the same time, we saw $75 billion of net liquidity inflows driven by significant inflows into our industry-leading government funds in March, as I mentioned earlier.AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, up 7% and 4% respectively, were driven by cumulative net inflows, partially offset by lower market levels.
And we now expect adjusted expenses for 2020 to be approximately $65 billion, largely due to lower volume and revenue related expenses versus the outlook we provided at Investor Day.It goes without saying all of this is market dependent and we'll keep you updated on future earnings calls.So, to wrap up, the challenges we are all facing as the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold around the globe are unprecedented.
And right now, we are focused on serving clients and customers and we've looked at a range of scenarios, so we can ensure that we're managing our capital quite carefully.Jamie talked about an extreme adverse scenario in his Chairman's letter that we've looked at, assuming large parts of the economy remain in lockdown through the end of this year.
How do you thread the needle between supporting your customers and the country and doing all those things that you want to do while still protecting the resiliency of the balance sheet and not getting hit with unexpected litigation costs as you mentioned in your CEO letter?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes, no, it's a very important question.
How do we think about it in terms of how much is attributed to sort of mechanistic model related changes where you calibrate your model for new economic scenario versus actual signs of stress that you're seeing in your book that maybe aren't showing up in credit measures but that you do think will show up in a reasonably short time period, call it, within the next few quarters; how much of it is growth, how much of it is mix?
And I think that has served us well coming into this crisis and we'll continue to stay close to our clients and manage that carefully.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI'll just add.
So, we're not worried about this very much.And like Jen said, so far if we look at spreads, there's probably a recovery this quarter.OperatorOur next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous Research.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystHi, Jen. Regarding credit cards, just based on payment rates that you've seen so far and maybe the draws on revolves, how are you expecting card spending and card balances to trend over the next few quarters this year?Jennifer A.
But right now, the market is performing a bit better and spreads have come in, as you mentioned.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerA couple of deals may be syndicated, hopefully might be syndicated at the end of the second or third quarter.OperatorOur next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.Chris Kotowski -- Oppenheimer & Co.
At Investor Day, Jamie, you said that the real earnings, pre-provision earnings minus net charge-offs [Technical Issues].James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI don't know about you guys, we can't understand a word he's saying.Jennifer A.
But, of course, it will all depend on whether these programs ultimately are able to bridge people back to employment.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe'll surely know a lot more in 90 days.Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe'll surely know a lot more in 90 days about how this affected, what we would have expected.Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, and to Jamie's point, what we may learn over the next 90 days is, of course, whether programs have been effective or were they just delayed losses.
",28.88,0.6420536
61,morganstanley,q1,2018,"In Institutional Securities alone, the dominance of Equities, the strength of Fixed Income, and the breadth of Investment Banking generated over $6 billion in revenue.Along with the rest of the industry, we recently submitted our 2018 CCAR plan.
However, as demonstrated by recent market dynamics, future activity may be impacted by regulatory, macroeconomic, and geopolitical factors.Our Sales and Trading businesses produced revenues of $4.4 billion, up 64% quarter over quarter.
I think what we've talked about coming into the -- throughout last year as well as coming into this year was a couple of factors that we suggested would slow down NII growth in this segment, and that's what we obviously saw this quarter.
We also told you last year that we thought that the deposit deployment strategy that we had in place was going to play out, and we were planning on diversifying our deposit and liability structure, which we obviously have done.What we have seen -- and, we talked about this last year and again this year -- our clients are deploying more cash into the markets, and they're putting it into different types of investments.
So, I think this is actually playing out as we expected, and it is going to be growth, but it will be slower.Sharon Yeshaya -- Head of Investor RelationsThank you.
What's the plan for how long that would stay on the balance sheet, and does this provide a pipeline for some DCM activity here over the coming quarters?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerThere's a lot of questions in there, and I would basically say yes to all of them, but let's just quickly tick off.
Again, within Fixed Income, there are lots of businesses -- macro, micro, corporate trading, commodities -- but within our SPG business, a larger percentage of that line item over time will be coming from these lending activities, and we've seen good growth in that area.
It does give us some stability, and we like the credit characteristics and the yield characteristics of that business, and we'll continue to try to grow it going forward.Sharon Yeshaya -- Head of Investor RelationsThank you.
I know it's an impossible question, but should we be expecting seasonality of the past, given the higher activity levels in those specific components this quarter?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerI'm glad you prefaced that by saying it's an impossible question, which means -- actually, I'm going to go back to Brennan's question because I realized I didn't answer the second part, and then, Glenn, I'll get back to you.
The flex is obviously how strong the markets are, reflecting the new issue calendar, which pumps up the banking, reflecting Equity activity depending on the div/of season, what time of the year it is, and then, obviously, Fixed Income.
A lot of that has gone away, so Fixed Income won't have the huge ups that we had in 2006 and 2007, most of which we gave back, but it's unlikely to have the kinds of downs that we had before we got rid of the physical stuff and restructured the business.So, I think the range of this firm is kind of a worst-case scenario without the market completely imploding around $7.5 billion a quarter.
Obviously, in a good market, a seasonally strong market, an active market -- all which we had in the first quarter -- slightly lower tax rate, slightly lower preferred that we have every other quarter, then you're going to be toward the higher ends of your ranges.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorI appreciate that.
The other question I just wanted to pick up on that was something that Jonathan mentioned in his remarks was the concept of the bid offer, which was up very strongly in the early part of the quarter -- I guess across a wide range of product.
So, there's things we could do, clearly, to drive returns higher, putting aside revenue growth, but what we're focused on is how are we going to do in a difficult market environment?So, seasonally, just add in the extra preferred, bring the tax rate up to 23% to 25% range that Jon talked about, and the returns for this quarter probably drop from 14.9% to -- rough math -- about 14%.
One follow-up on terms of environment -- now that you have $70 billion of loans, up almost 20% year over year, how do you reassure investors that these loans will stay of good quality?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, I think from the overall credit quality, there's a couple of components.
As rates rise, we'll also see presumably less run-off, but again, we feel good about where we are in terms of the lending growth -- slower first quarter, but as expected.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystVery good.
The volumes have gone up dramatically, so although there are different dynamics around voice versus electronic, we've been making up a lot of it in volume, but there is clearly pressure on the voice trading part of the business.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you.Sharon Yeshaya -- Head of Investor RelationsThank you.
On the non-comp side, we expected some lip with the activity, but maybe just some color on what's being driven by activity versus what -- you guys mentioned some of the investments in Wealth Management -- what we should be expecting as more ongoing.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, I think based on our expectations and budgets, we actually were right in line with what our expectations were on the non-revenue-related items, and then we saw a clear increase in BC&E, which shows up in the BC&E line, an increase in transaction taxes, increases in U.K. bank levy, and some of the other things that would show up in the other expense line.
So, anything around transparency around the scenarios -- and, that's one of the things that we're going to comment on, and I think Vice Chairman Quarles mentioned something about putting out the scenarios for comment -- any of that would be helpful for us to plan our business because we look at things for the longer term, and to get a surprise year after year based on the scenario does obviously inhibit some of that long-term strategy planning.Sharon Yeshaya -- Head of Investor RelationsThank.
Just a follow-up on that -- James, as you said, you've built more stable, you think stable, revenue-producing business model, yet when we look at the stress tests, you get hit the hardest in terms of starting point to stress minimum, in terms of loss rates.
Some of that this year is going to be a function -- as you know, a significant portion of our revenues and wealth comes from our fee-based flows, and if your markets are down 65% and they don't ever recover, that obviously has an impact on our business.The other thing you should know is all these tests -- we're not allowed to make any sort of management action, so we just watch all of this go on and have no ability to react to it.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd specifically on us, historically, we said the constraint was leverage ratio, and as the models in the Fed have done, you grow your balance sheet, then that's highly punitive.
Again, the way I would describe this -- first of all, I think you've heard James talk a lot about this business being ballast, so it's not going to move quarter over quarter sequentially very much.
It looks like you're gaining market share, so I want to understand what you're doing globally, but also in Europe in particular in this area.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, I would say broadly, Fixed Income was strong.
We remain appropriately sized to take advantage of active markets when they present themselves.Investment Banking demonstrated sustained strength despite new-issue markets being punctuated by periods of elevated volatility.
For the quarter, a combination of continued advisory growth supported by secular trends and the business' scale-driven operating leverage produced record pre-tax profit of $1.2 billion.
At the same time, we continue to actively invest in the business, building out our digital offerings, banking products, and technology capabilities more broadly.Investment Management again witnessed net long-term inflows over the quarter as the team continues to produce strong investment returns across both alternatives and public markets.
In the quarter, we closed the Mesa West acquisition and made several key hires.We've often said that wealth and investment management give us ballast, and our other businesses make up the engine that drives this firm forward in more active markets.
We believe we are sufficiently capitalized and expect to maintain our attractive capital return profiles over coming years.As we look forward, our objectives remain the same: To execute on our strategy and deliver on the medium-term goals laid out at the beginning of this year.
Our Institutional Securities businesses benefited from increased trading volumes and the return of healthy volatility across many asset classes.
Revenues were $2.6 billion, up 33% sequentially, on strengths across all products and all regions.Derivatives had a very strong quarter as episodes of volatility created significant trading activity and strong client demand for hedging solutions.
Our securitized product group had one of its best quarters in close to four years, driven by strength in Europe and a more active trading backdrop.
The increase was driven by higher market volatility and facilitation of increased client activity.Turning to Wealth Management, revenues of $4.4 billion were down 1% quarter over quarter as continued growth in asset management was offset by the impact of mark-to-market undeferred compensation plan investments.
On a year-over-year basis, non-compensation expenses were flat despite an 8% growth in revenues.Total client assets were essentially unchanged at $2.4 trillion, reflecting softness in domestic and international equity indices.
Fee-based assets continue to be a source of long-term organic growth for the business, supported by both conversions from brokerage and net new asset flows into the firm.
As a result, fee-based assets reached a new high of $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client assets.Asset management revenues were $2.5 billion.
Over time, we believe that these advancements will enable our advisors to provide better advice and service and broaden their client relationships.In Investment Management, revenues were $718 million, up 13% sequentially, driven by higher asset management fees and the absence of last quarter's impairment charge.
Although we saw outflows in our liquidity business as clients managed their cash balance needs around the turn of the year, our long-term strategy saw continued positive flows.
Investment revenues were $77 million, down by 31% relative to last quarter, impacted by lower market performance in certain private-equity-related funds.
This quarter's results demonstrate that increased levels of activity and client engagement are broadly beneficial to our business.
",35.28,0.83269703
62,morganstanley,q2,2018,"Whatever transpires this quarter, we remain confident in the medium-term goals we laid out at the beginning of the year and are well on track with each of them.I'll now turn the call over to Jon.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, and good morning.
Institutional securities generated revenues of $5.7 billion in the second quarter.Continued strength across investment banking, equities, and fixed income has contributed to year-to-date revenues of $11.8 billion, our strongest first half of the year, excluding DVA, since 2007 and a 19% increase versus the same period last year.
In our macro business, we saw strong client activity in FX.Rates was impacted by range-bound yields in the second half of the quarter.
The initial phase of the redesign became effective at the end of the quarter, resulting in approximately $10 billion of incremental sweep deposits.This increase was partially offset by outflows in the quarter, primarily driven by taxes and a continued market deployment.
But we're very comfortable with our overall positions, Glenn.And when we think about our risk profile and our business mix, we like the business that we're doing, and we're very happy with the results.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystOK.
That -- in other words, you're not chasing hot CD rates.You're providing high rates to people that bring more balances to their Morgan Stanley relationship.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, certainly, the -- in the wealth management channel, the new CD promotional rates and savings rates have been for new money, as you said.
And I think everybody is kind of taking a little pause on that and trying to figure out what is the right level of capital you need in the financial system to fund economic growth and what's the right leverage of the institutions.
I guess, first question here just on the retention loans and wealth management, where, I think, the balance was $3.6 billion at last quarter.
I'm just trying to kind of think about the moving part here because I know it's important to the kind of the forward margin story.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerI'll try to take some of those.
higher rev, higher comp, higher sales and trading results, higher BC&E and transaction taxes.The one other area that you're seeing good growth is, really, I guess, from an FCC-disclosure standpoint, the IP and T line, which is where you'll see some of the impact of our technology investments where we continue to make those investments to improve technology, both outward facing and inward facing across the whole plant.
But the bank will remain a very important source of growth over many years and then our geographic repositioning, particularly in Asia, where we're investing stronger than we need to, for example, in the U.S. So a huge amount going on.We might not be making a lot of announcements about it, which is fine.
What are the goals from some of these investments?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. I would say that you've sort of highlighted what our expectations are.
And although we've made significant investments and had a lot of technological change within the business, these trends are going to play out over a significant number of years.
And probably more importantly, just how you're thinking about managing risk because it does seem more consistent than a lot of the peers in the industry.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, thank you for that.
We feel very good about the risk profile of the business.And it's really driven based on our client relationships and client activity and client flows.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.
And that's kind of an adjustment that I think and hope will be more appreciated over time in the way the models are constructed under the stress test.If you just look at the stability of that business quarter after quarter, it's pretty evident that even in very difficult markets, it remained stable.
So I think that the -- that change is going to be a net positive.But as we transitioned from the old platform to the new platform, we obviously were very sensitive to the customer experience and effectively slowed down that business.
Your line is now open.Christian Bolu -- Bernstein -- AnalystGood morning, guys.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Christian Bolu -- Bernstein -- AnalystJust quickly on the sweep changes that you've made to the deposit program, so, I guess, $20 billion, $10 billion from this quarter and -- $10 billion from last quarter and $10 billion going forward, is that it?
Or is there more that you think you can generate after that?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, again, from the redesign itself, that will be it.
So is the right way to think about that, you're going -- the capital ratio should be increasing over the year?
Or irrespective of client activity, you have the ability to grow the balance sheet and keep the capital ratios flat through the year?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. I think -- I mean, we have that flexibility.
And if there are opportunities to support clients and invest that capital into the business at a good return, we'll do that.OperatorThank you.
I will keep my remarks brief today when describing the quarter's performance, as the results are relatively straightforward.This is the second quarter the firm generated revenues in excess of $10 billion.
Investment banking and equities reported very strong results, and fixed income continued to perform well.Wealth management remained solid.
We will not get ahead of ourselves in predicting what the Fed will do next year, but 2018 appears to be a transition year.Going forward, we expect to be able to continue to invest in our business and offer our shareholders an attractive capital return, while maintaining a prudent capital base.
Year-to-date revenues were $21.7 billion, a firm record after excluding the impact of DVA in prior periods.Second-quarter diluted EPS was $1.30, ROE was 13%, and return on tangible common equity was 14.9%.
Investment banking performed very well as new issue markets remained open and receptive to corporate strategic activity.
Equity sales and trading was buoyed by active global markets, and fixed income benefited from strong client flow.We delivered solid results across Wealth and Investment Management, our sources of more stable revenues.
In investment banking, all products and regions performed well, generating revenues of $1.7 billion.The results represent a 12% increase versus a strong first quarter.
Clients remained engaged, and pipelines are healthy.New issue market conditions remained favorable in the quarter, with significant investor demand across both equity and fixed income, supporting strong underwriting results.
Clients in Asia continue to be active, including a number of large IPOs in the quarter.Fixed income underwriting results increased 4% sequentially to $540 million, with stable results across both high-yield and investment-grade issuance.
Derivatives and cash revenues remained robust, although lower in -- than in Q1 as market volatility and global volumes trended lower.Fixed income continued to perform well, with quarterly revenues of $1.4 billion.
Each business line saw a sequential decline versus a very strong Q1, but divisional revenues were up 12% year over year.
Net interest income was $1 billion for the quarter, down 2% sequentially, driven primarily by lower prepayment amortization gains.Year-to-date NII of $2.1 billion represents a 5% increase.
While funding in the U.S.banks grew by 2% to $70 billion in a seasonally strong quarter, as clients use their SBL lines to manage liquidity through the tax season.
A flatter yield curve has also shifted clients investing into shorter-duration products at lower commission rates.Consequently, transactional revenues of $691 million was down 7% sequentially.
Fundamentals remained strong.Our sources of annuitized revenues continued to grow with consistent fee-based flows and record balances for both fee-based assets and loans.
Year over year, revenue has grown 13% driven by continued strong investment performance and positive flows, particularly in our active fundamental equity and multi-asset strategies.
Our first-half results have been strong with two consecutive quarters with revenues greater than $10 billion.All of our businesses are positioned for growth and to support our clients if activity levels remain high.
Curious on how you think about the opportunities given your relationships with the sponsors and then how that factors in from a ""what you're willing to risk"" perspective.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.
Good morning.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning, Guy.Guy Moszkowski -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystSo let me just follow up, if I might, on Glenn's question about the deposits.
Just help us think a little bit, from a very big picture point of view, how you're thinking about deploying deposit funding, despite the fact that it's clearly getting more expensive.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.
But maybe there was some incremental tech invest.How should we think about that line as a jumping-off point from here?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. There's marketing and business development.
And we've probably made more strategic change to this institution in the last five or eight years than we made in the previous 80.We had a wealth management business in 2006 that had revenues of $5 billion and pre-tax profits of $300 million.
Are they getting more conservative, less conservative in that leverage loan business, please?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.
Is there any way for you to be able to take advantage of where -- at least where current market rates are and be able to either maybe extend duration or not even extend duration, just at current coupons to create a little bit higher yield in that portfolio?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. I would say that we're very comfortable with our ALM position.

63,morganstanley,q3,2018,"The first half of the year was characterized by a strong market environment and increased levels of client activity.Commensurate with that backdrop, we delivered returns above the top end of the ROE target range of 10% to 13% over that first half period.
In the meantime, we remain confident and optimistic about the near-term prospects for a strong finish through 2018.I will now turn it over to Jon, who will discuss the quarter in detail.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentThank you and good morning.
And compensation expenses were $1.6 billion, bringing the year-to-date compensation to net ratio revenue to 34.5%.Investment banking reported revenues of $1.5 billion, down 14% relative to the second quarter, reflecting a normal seasonal slowdown in activity.
The growth in these metrics supported higher asset management and net interest revenues, contributing to the 2% sequential increase of total quarterly revenues of $4.4 billion.The business continues to demonstrate significant operating leverage.
Year-to-date results demonstrate that we can steadily grow this business, while continuing to make investments into tools to support asset growth, increase client engagement and improve cost efficiencies.In Investment Management, we saw continued positive long-term flows, $3 billion in the quarter, supported by strength in overseas distribution.
On a year-to-date basis, Asset Management revenues are up 13% on strong investment performance and positive flows, particularly in our active fundamental equity strategies.
We have seen a little bit more of a shift into the fixed income investing than we did -- probably what we saw in 2017, but all in all it's been a -- sort of both a nice way to supplement liquidity in the bank, but also bring in new assets to the Firm.Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- AnalystTerrific.
Are there any limits to thinking about further share gains, particularly in the financing side of the business?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentListen, Brennan, as you mentioned, we've gained significant share over the last four or five years.
Again, we try to focus on the net interest income in the wealth business and you can see that that business, the NII has grown about 4% to 5% year-to-date.On the first question, it's a good question Mike and we continue to make investments in the liability structure.
What's been the range of those cash levels, like over the last five or 10 years?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentI think over five, I would say 8% to 10%, but now down to 6%.
Your line is open.Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGood morning.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentGood morning.Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystRevenue obviously was strong this quarter, it's been strong year-to-date, it sounds like it's off to a good start this quarter.
And then if there's still further optimization that you can do to the CET-1 after going up 90 bps this quarter?James Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell, it's obviously -- it's kind of a -- apart from where goes the market from here, the second question is what is likely to evolve on the regulatory front, not just in 2019, but over the next three or four years.
Can you give us an update on the what -- how this impacts your business, maybe specifically in IM with -- like the investment line?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentSure.
So I think it will continue to see some impact from that, but I think again that's the sort of the tail on the dog, the primary driver of revenue growth for us in that business is going to be around the fee based assets.
Basically the businesses have been optimizing their balance sheet and their funding and that's sort of collectively the net result being the statement we made in the press release that the net funding costs are down, it's really based on usage, not rate.Guy Moszkowski -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystAnd is there any sustainability to that or -- just in terms of the lower funding costs or it was just something that was helpful this quarter?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentI think it was helpful this quarter.
Just curious on how big and what business that was?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentYes, that was a deal that was announced I believe in the second quarter, closed in the third quarter.
I was hoping you could give us some insight about how you think about earnings resiliency in a sustained market correction and given some of the commentary around the movement in cash balances, how much of an offset do you think that could provide if equity market -- weakness persists?James Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI mean, listen, we had a more challenging third quarter, both from market activity and just seasonal volumes, and we delivered an ROE of -- what was it -- 11.5% in that environment.
So we're not as correlated to equity market movements as I think is sort of believed, if you actually look at the stability of the franchise across each of the businesses.Now, clearly if you have a sustained correction, call it 20% every year, we're affected by that.
I was wondering from your perspective, how you think about balancing the need to continue to deliver margin improvement versus some of the higher investment needs as you look out for other growth opportunities.James Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes. Honestly, I think you're raising a very good point and I don't -- if that's the view of some people on the Street, I don't understand that view.
So how has dialogue gone, how do you convince or think about the stress test and how that impacts your ability to return even more capital, given that your ratios are dramatically higher than your peers?James Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes, Jim, it is the question and I'll start and we should spend some time and I want Jon to weigh in on this, because he's been pivotal to all the discussions we've had in DCM with our regulators.
As you kind of see that loan growth, should we except margin to -- can continue to move a little higher?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentYes, I think that's the right characterization.
And then just to follow up here, maybe good to get a little more perspective on just the investment banking activity levels in the various businesses.
We have seen a little bit of consolidation with MiFID going into place as people reduce the number of counter-parties they deal with, but I think the general comment was generally the top providers, top three or top four, top five, depending on the market, where the product have generally been gaining share and we would expect that that trend will continue.OperatorThank you.
And thirdly, meaningfully investing in our culture to ensure we remain an employer of choice for top talent and manage our business with professionalism with whatever challenges we face.These strategic choices were designed to ensure that as much as we can control, the Firm does well in a strong market (technical difficulty) demonstrates stability in a seasonally or structurally more difficult one.
Wealth Management delivered another solid quarter and Investment Management saw continued positive long-term net flows, although investment results were impacted by weaker emerging markets.We continue to benefit from the inherent operating leverage of our business model.
Year-to-date revenues of $16.7 billion are up 17% versus the same period last year, benefiting from active global markets, increasing revenue pools and stable to improving wallet share.
Activity remained healthy across products and regions with particular strength in IPOs. Americas was strong throughout the quarter, while Asia and Europe saw some seasonal slowdown in August before a strong September.Fixed income underwriting revenues were $508 million.
Increased results in investment grade issuance partially offset a slowdown in high yield financing relative to a very active second quarter.
Event-driven transactions remain a significant driver, supported by the active M&A backdrop and our ability to leverage our global franchise to provide holistic client solutions.
Sequential revenues declined across each business line as the quarter was characterized by low market volumes and more subdued volatility compared to the first half of the year.
And derivative results were also strong, aided by a diversified product set and client mix.Fixed income revenues of $1.2 billion were down 15% versus the second quarter.
Rates was negatively impacted by range-bound yields and low volatility globally.Our credit business saw a sequential decline on lower client activity across product areas.
Despite seasonal headwinds this quarter, our revenues remain solid.Turning to Wealth Management.
Net fee-based flows also remained strong at $16 billion, contributing to 3% growth in fee-based assets, which now stand at $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client assets.
In addition to the traditional decline in retail engagement during the summer months, we saw clients continue to focus more of their fixed income investing into shorter duration products at lower commission rates.
However, due to the impact of positive mark-to-market on deferred compensation plans, total transaction revenues of $698 million remained essentially unchanged.
On a year-to-date basis, transactional revenues represent approximately 16% of total net revenues versus 22% in the same period three years ago.This quarter's results once again demonstrate the stability and health of our wealth business.
Our supplementary leverage ratio remained flat at 6.4%.During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of common stock or 24 million shares.

64,morganstanley,q4,2018,"The results of 2018 CCAR translated into a flat total capital distribution to 2017 CCAR, a position we believe we can improve upon going forward.Moving to slide five, stability is critical when markets are volatile.
The ROE of that business almost doubled to 20% over the last six years.On slide 12, the industry has experienced a secular shift away from transactional toward advisory accounts with service fee-based assets.
As we noted last year, Investment Management is a business positioned for growth and we're executing on that opportunity, as evidenced by strong growth in asset management fees since we refocused our efforts on Investment Management in late 2015.Across our business lines, we are seeing strong investment performance by management client partnerships and distribution and continued product innovation.
A key part of the strategy also includes inorganic growth, driven by new talent, team lift-outs and acquisitions in areas we believe we can deliver differentiated value to our clients.Taken as a whole, slide 16 illustrates the operating leverage of this institution.
We will be looking for similar bolt-on acquisitions within both, our Wealth and Investment Management businesses.Lastly, while not a point of growth, we reiterate that given our business mix and model and our capital base, we will look to achieve 100% payout ratio going forward, subject to obviously the regulatory approval and any acquisition opportunities that may come our way.Our management team remains committed to executing on our long-term strategy and fulfilling our strategic objectives.
In addition to the challenging market dynamics, factors specific to Morgan Stanley further impacted quarterly results, namely sharp losses to the investments associated with employee deferred compensation plans, had a considerable impact on transactional revenues in Wealth Management.Additionally, we made slight modifications to the Firm's incentive compensation, subject to deferral schedules, in order to bring them more in line with peers.
Non-compensation expenses of $1.9 billion increased 8% versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by execution-related costs and seasonality.While the difficult backdrop weighed on market making, client activity remained robust.
The compensation ratio for the quarter and full year was approximately 31% and 34%, respectively.Investment banking revenues of $1.4 billion, declined modestly from prior quarter, consistent with lower industry volumes.
We expect to retain our leadership position and finished number one globally for the fifth consecutive year.Fixed Income results for the quarter were weak against a challenging market backdrop.
Both seasonal factors and increased economic uncertainty related to growth and rate outlooks for 2019 and beyond, influenced markets, resulting in rapid movements in spreads and asset prices.Credit was impacted by a significant widening of spreads toward the end of the year.
And on a full year basis, asset management revenues increased 9%, a function of higher fee-based client assets, driven by markets and flows.Total client assets of $2.3 trillion in the fourth quarter decreased 8% sequentially, reflective of broader market movements.
Total US Bank deposits of $187 billion, increased 7% versus the third quarter, driven by higher deposit sweep balances.In particular, our bank deposit program benefited from seasonality and clients holding more cash in the phase of volatile markets.
Net interest income of $1.1 billion increased 2% versus the prior quarter and 4% over the full year.We expect 2019 annual NII growth to be in line with loan growth.
Increased lending penetration, the adoption of digital tools, fee-based asset flows and minimal attrition, indicate an engaged financial advisor population and a business position to grow.
Asset management fees of $628 million grew 4% versus the third quarter, driven by a significant amount of the year's performance fees being recognized in the fourth quarter.This increase was a result of the revenue recognition accounting rule change implemented early this year.
As we have previously said, this line has the potential to be lumpy, though we continue to see broad-based gains in our private alternative strategies.Other revenues were impacted by an impairment of a legacy non-controlling interest and a third-party asset manager.
While we cannot predict how these dynamics will unfold in 2019, we are focused on growing and supporting our clients and are prepared to respond to market environments with appropriate actions.Although the asset pricing witness at the end of the year will have an impact on first quarter results, markets have settled into tighter ranges and historical relationships have broke down in the fourth quarter have realigned.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Guy Moszkowski -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystFirst question, I wanted to ask was just, I recognize in Wealth Management, there were some moving parts that had to do with two different deferred comp programs, one being the one that affects both the expense and the revenue lines equally and we've seen that before.But it appears that there was another one that had a one-time impact on costs.
So, a new issue coming to market, the banking calendar being positive, clients see something that's attractive out there to participate in and they start getting moving and the advisors are calling them.
So, I don't see -- again, I've been doing this a very longtime and this is not a period where I would say you're seeing any fundamental shifting client attitude or confidence.You definitely have a very low level of transaction, which we've had for two years and it's got increasingly lower and even pushed into more money being cashed through the fourth quarter.
Pruzan -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey, Mike.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystI'm struggling with the quarter, understanding exactly what happened.
Pruzan -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think there's a couple ways to think about it on both revenue and expenses and also time.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWhy don't I start on this and let Jon talk about how to think about the institutional business and expense management versus growth.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystCan you guys give us some color?
And just what you're seeing in that market and maybe compared to prior time periods where you guys were involved in that business?Jonathan M.
Pruzan -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAgain, we obviously have multiple products, mortgage being one, the securities-based lending business, tailored lending within the wealth segment.
Regarding Investment Management, it's fair to say, we are positioning the business for growth, but it's still early days.On capital return, we increased our dividend to $0.30 per share, and had a buyback of $4.9 billion.
We believe that the stability of our team and business model compared to an industry, much of which is still going through change, should enable us to continue to take market share.Moving to slide nine.
Within the year, we saw patches of overperformance, as well as underperformance, obviously, in the fourth quarter.The net result of an 11.5% ROE, excluding intermittent discrete tax items, demonstrates that we're on the right track.
We are confident in this institution's ability to deliver both future profitability and performance at the levels that we've outlined.I'm going to now turn the call over to Jon, who will talk about the fourth quarter in detail, the annual results and then, of course, we'll take your questions.Jonathan M.
Although these factors are not material for the annual results, adjustments can be amplified in any given quarter and impact the segments in slightly different ways.Now to the businesses, our Institutional Securities business reported revenues of $3.8 billion in the quarter, a 22% sequential decline.
We saw clients derisk and delever in the second half of the quarter.Advisory, however, remained strong and we had our best quarterly results in over 10 years.
That said, persistent volatility and changes to sentiment could impact our ability to bring transactions to market.In equities, the business performed well.
Volatile market conditions, including the severity of intraday and intraweek movements impacted performance in cash and derivatives in the fourth quarter.In prime brokerage, the results remain strong.
We are critically and credibly sized for the opportunity and are well positioned to continue to support our clients.Wealth Management finished a strong year on a weak note impacted by the decline in asset prices and the impact of market volatility on investment banking revenues.
Overall, segment revenues were $4.1 billion for the quarter.Over the last several years, the impacts from our employee deferred compensation plans have had limited impact on both revenues and pre-tax margin.
The growth in annual revenues and the limited increase in non-comp expenses, while still investing in the platform, highlight the businesses extraordinary benefits of scale.The PBT margin was 24.4% for the quarter.
Higher asset levels at the end of the third quarter helps insulate these revenues against the market's decline in the fourth quarter.
Given the number of factors that can distort any individual quarter, we continue to manage this business with a long-term lens.
We would expect the margin to rebound in the first quarter, and we are confident in our ability to deliver our 26% to 28% margin objective in 2019.Investment Management reported revenues of $684 million, a 5% increase sequentially.
In fact, several years ago we just thought it was a little over the top and we were pushing too much, frankly too much revenue in the future years, which is mortgaging your future and not healthy and we adjusted that one time.In the last couple of years, with particularly our more junior employees at the sort of associate VP level, if you look at where they were deferred relative to the street, they were clearly an outlier.
And again, over a long period of time -- excuse me, over the annual basis, the deferred comp plans have generally been pretty -- have not really impacted the PBT.But we did obviously see a 14% decrease in the S&P in the quarter, and within wealth based on the mix of how those employees invest their assets in the deferral schedules, you saw a bigger revenue impact there.
And I would -- as I mentioned in my script, if you take those, as well as the seasonality as well as some of the volatility we saw in the investment banking or I guess in the calendar revenue, which you can see in the supplement, the margin would have been closer to the full year margin, had those impacts not occurred.OperatorThank you.
And backdrop on the traditional side of the business, we know that Morgan Stanley sold the retail component of its business and alternative world is growing.So, you gave us a look on check mark in each asset class, but can we sharpen that a little -- focus a little bit more and say, why now, what particular focus, and then maybe how you think about investing in that business versus say buying back stock at book value?James P.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah , I mean, if the stock stays at -- if the stocks at $42 or whatever it is, going to open up this morning, that's -- I kind of like buying that all day long, to be blunt.
Listen, the Investment Management platform is very interesting.We are, I think, as the slide shows, we have very good loan-only business.
We had very good flows into managed equities, which is -- and obviously the Street did not experience that, so that's a positive.Our fixed income businesses has typically being small -- not typically, it is smaller than we would like.
So, we plan all of those and if we can drop in a series of sort of string a pull type acquisitions across the platform, while we are driving organic growth in the actively managed, which is the high-margin business, we have better scale in the fixed income platform.
It's just something that given, obviously, the disappointing sort of stick at the price numbers of some of the stuff that it affects things like the margin Wealth Management because as I said, $40 million, $45 million is a point of margin.
I don't think you are going to -- we're not talking bull market rebound obviously.
On the other hand, it could be Morgan Stanley of old, where you had hiccups in fixed income like the second half of '15 or 2013 or during the financial crisis.So my question is, how much of this quarter, the fourth quarter, I get, you got your targets for the year, but I'm really talking about the fourth quarter.
I don't really see it -- I certainly don't see it as a B, which is Morgan Stanley of old, if you will, the sort of episodic volatile shifts, overdependence on propositions, big marks, misplaced trades, major integrations going on, at the same time, selling businesses, writing stuff off, it's not bad.
As I said, we had good client activity, part of facilitating our market-making businesses, standing in between flow and that flow was tough this quarter.
And again, we think it's a real nice opportunity over the medium to longer term to bring in more clients and more assets into the business.OperatorThank you.
And then I guess, specifically within the Institutional Securities, you've had really nice market share gain in the investment bank, as well as across the trading businesses in the past couple years.
Since some of the volatile, like line items, when I think about the institutional, business like the other line that credit flows through, investment line that was negative and then even the deferred comp, was there anything in the fourth quarter that was more like realized losses versus mark-to-market that if the market continues to stabilize, we would expect some normalization there?Jonathan M.
And we feel very good about sort of that book-of-business and being able to bring that to market assuming these conditions continue to holdOn the CLO front, as you know, we are an active securitizer.
",30.98,0.8485816999999999
65,morganstanley,q1,2019,"Across the board, ROE, ROTCE, the Firm efficiency ratio and wealth management margin are in line with or at the higher end of our strategic objectives, ensuring a very solid start of the year.Consistent with our objective to invest for growth, we announced our intent to acquire Solium Capital, a leading global software provider for equity administration, financial reporting and compliance.
Compensation expenses were $1.8 billion resulting in a compensation to net revenue ratio of 35%, consistent with last year's ratio.In investment banking, we generated revenues of $1.2 billion, a 19% decrease relative to the fourth quarter.
Strong non-compensation expense discipline and the benefit of the retention note roll off more than offset the effect of lower asset values, resulting in a margin of 27.1%.As demonstrated during the quarter, we have leveraged to protect the margin, while still investing for growth.
First question is on non-comp expense, we saw a pull back nicely here in the quarter.
Can you help us think about how we should think about the amount of flex that you have in that line to potentially offset environmental pressure if we see that flaring up again, maybe a bit of a context around fixed versus variable?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah sure, I'll take a shot and as you said, we thought we had a nice quarter on the non-comp side.
We did also see as you would expect, year-over-year a decline in some of the execution-related expenses given the decline in revenues, but again a nice quarter for us on the expense side, 71% efficiency ratio, well below our target of 73%.Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- AnalystOkay.
It, obviously, wasn't cheap on a multiple basis, so I see it as buying the technology and giving us access to a new channel with multiple verticals into it.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then just briefly on timing, we would expect the deal to close shortly.
I mean, there's a lot of chatter in the market about the number of IPOs upcoming and I guess you get more than your fair share in tech IPOs, can you quantify, kind of what you're seeing, what's in the pipeline, what maybe a little after the pipeline for the period you compare this to?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerI will try to give you a little bit more context, although I think the adjectives were our attempt to give you that context.
That's a broad-based franchise that we're very confident in and as you know, given the sort of December hangover, the earnings season as well as the government shutdown, we did see a significant portion of the IPO calendar get pushed out, not canceled but pushed out.We also then saw over the course of the quarter increasing buildup of the pipeline in the IPO products.
I mean, the bottom line, the business has scale, a point margin on $4.4 billion of revenues, $44 million.
And the first quarter just shows the benefit of scale and our ability to pull levers and sort of manage between growth and investment.OperatorThank you.
We have a lot of confidence in that business and continues to do well.On the equity side, we came into the quarter with activity levels low and average balances or balances quite low given the volatility in the December timeframe.
I would assume there were some offset in comp, but if you could just sort of help with that?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerSure and I would say, you sum it up properly, which is that the PBT impact both in terms of dollars and margin is actually quite minimal.
And it's clearly a strong result, I just want to gauge how much of that strength is recurring and what we should be comfortable run rating in our models?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerThe three components on the MSIM, again, the fee-based revenue I mentioned, the performance fees and then investments can be lumpy.
It was fees.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, fees in general, there is -- we feel very good about the results, there wasn't anything particularly unique in the results outside of the investment management comments I made about investments being lumpy and the performance fees.
Or how should we think about the go forward here?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, it was a nice non-comp quarter.
I think the deal is closing in May. Am I right, Jon?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.James P.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThere'll be some integration costs with that, some technology investments and so on, that's not, obviously, huge given just the size of the business, but that may bounce the numbers around a little bit over the next couple of quarters.
We have a $17 billion revenue business in Wealth Management that has nothing to do with Solium right now.
Jon, do you want to add to that?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerNo. I think your focus is right in terms of both Wealth and IM, sort of more of the fee-based type businesses, less balance sheet intensive, and that's really what the focus has been.
I mean, I think, first and foremost, I would just say one, there's just been less movement of people both in and out and that's good for stability of the platform, the ability to build relationships and continue to invest, so that's a positive.
But just talk about some of those dynamics and the flexibility you have specifically in comp, and layer the retention and the roll-off -- sorry, and the front ending of some compensation in 4Q?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerI'll try to take that in two components.
On the ISG side, you saw the comp ratios sort of consistent with last year's first quarter.
Thank you.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYep.OperatorThank you.
Jon.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. And again, I would look at the asset management space, it's not necessarily in totality.
While activity was not as robust as early 2018, the improvement in sentiment, CEO dialogue and Boardroom conversations are all encouraging.Our wealth business absorbed lower fourth quarter asset levels and delivered strong results.
We remain confident in the Firm's outlook and broader economic activity, but we're cognizant that global risks are more balanced.Against this backdrop, we remain very focused on expense discipline while still investing for growth.
Through Solium, we gained a new scalable channel and direct sales force, giving us the ability to target another client population, particularly a younger demographic in its wealth accumulation phase.On a combined basis, we will now have direct exposure to over 2.5 million individuals via Solium's Workplace Services complementing the over 3 million wealth management clients, our financial advisors already serve in our traditional business.What excites us is the expansion into the workplace, delivering financial wellness services to clients and offering financial advice, education and the ability to transact through their employer.
Still, the Firm produced solid results, revenues of $10.3 billion declined only 7% year-over-year compared against the strongest quarter in the Firm's history, ex DVA.On a sequential basis, revenues increased 20%.
Importantly, there has been a pickup in activity levels and pipelines are healthy.Turning to underwriting, new issue market conditions were more challenged at the outset, but issuance built momentum as the quarter progressed.
Revenues were $2 billion declining 21% year-over-year and increasing 4% quarter-over-quarter.On a sequential basis, derivatives and cash revenues improved with derivatives benefiting from improved markets and corporate activity, In prime brokerage, sequential and year-over-year revenue declines were driven by lower average balances.
While market indices have rallied materially and sentiment has improved, clients remain cautious.First quarter fixed income results were strong following the traditional seasonal pattern.
The market was generally characterized by tightening credit spreads, declining interest rates, low volatility and uneven client activity across business lines as well as benefits from structured client activity.Macro rebounded broadly on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
Micro results were robust both sequentially and annually, driven by particular strength in corporate credit.Tightening credit spreads and increased secondary trading activity resulted in higher client revenues.
Despite lower starting asset levels, the business produced a PBT margin of 27.1%, demonstrating resilience despite large market draw downs in the fourth quarter.Total client assets ended the quarter at 2.5 trillion, an 8% increase versus the prior quarter, reflecting positive asset flows to the Firm and the rebound in asset prices.
The 8% decline from the prior quarter was primarily driven by last quarter's lower ending asset levels.Total bank lending ended the quarter at $71.5 billion while funded balances declined slightly quarter-over-quarter, driven by a handful of large pay downs in the tailored lending book and a modest decline in security-based lending, commitments did rise.
The rise in commitments and solid mortgage growth over the quarter are encouraging and we continue to expect mid-single digit percentage loan balance growth for the full year.Net interest income growth of 3% to $1.1 billion was primarily driven by the benefit of the December rate increase and the corresponding impact on our investment portfolio yields.
Investment management produced very strong results, revenues of $804 million was up 18% sequentially and were the highest for the segment in over five years.
As noted historically, this line item has the potential to be lumpy.Total AUM of $480 billion was up 4% versus the prior quarter with long-term AUM of $321 billion increasing 7%.
Asset management fees of $617 million were down 2% sequentially, the higher management fees on the back of improved average AUM over the quarter were offset by lower performance fees.As we have met mentioned before, as a result of the revenue recognition accounting rule implemented in 2018, a significant amount of any year's performance fees will be recognized in the fourth quarter with a small amount being recognized in this first quarter.
Total expenses increased by 3% quarter-over-quarter driven by higher carry compensation, which offset a decline in non-comp expenses.Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets of $876 billion increased 3%, driven by client activity, primarily in equity sales and trading and ISG lending.
Markets in the second quarter have been constructive, pipelines are healthy in investment banking and higher asset levels will support fee-based revenues in our Wealth Management business.We are keenly aware that open and functioning markets and economic stability are instrumental in supporting confidence and activity levels moving forward.
And then switching gears to Solium, James, I know you referenced it and provided some high level context around how you're thinking about it strategically.
My guess is, it's primarily a Wealth Management customer acquisition tool potentially, but I would think that it might play in a bit on the banking side too particularly in developing relationships with privates.
So again, we feel very good about the mid single-digit guidance on loan growth and NII, even though clearly expectations around rates in the forward curve are different than when we started the beginning of the year.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystNow, thanks for that color.
I was just wondering if you could provide any insight into how much of that fee strength that we saw in Investment Management, transactional activity in Wealth and other sales and trading is sustainable.

66,morganstanley,q1,2020,"And they were natural consequences of the market turmoil, namely the decline in deferred compensation plan investments, and increase in the amount of prepayment amortization.Notwithstanding all of this, the firm generated $9.5 billion of revenues and an ROTCE of 9.7%.
And in the meantime, we will continue to do our part for broader society.I will now turn the call over to Jon, to discuss the results of the first quarter in greater detail, our perspectives on the outlook given the current environment, and then take it back where we'll both answer your questions.
In late March, we reached the recent low in balances as market levels declined and we saw our clients significantly degress.We entered the second quarter with lower spot balances down close to 30%, and a more challenged environment in Europe.
Higher asset levels at the beginning of the first two months of the quarter helped insulate these revenues from the subsequent market decline in March.
E*Trade will hold the shareholder vote this summer, and we remain on-track to close the transaction in the fourth quarter.Taken in full, we are very pleased with the firm's results and stability of the business model.
But there are several factors that will impact our earnings power in the near term, including lower asset values and balances, interest rates near zero, as well as volatility and economic uncertainty impacting Capital Markets and M&A volumes.The second half of the year remains uncertain and the path of the economy will be driven by the time it takes to resolve the health crisis and the impact of the unprecedented fiscal and monetary response.With that, we will now open the line for questions.Questions and Answers:OperatorThank you.
Where do we take hits across the various parts of the plant, and you're going to take them whether it's in the margin book, whether it's in the asset management portfolios, whether it's in the trading businesses and had it all of that look.Now, we didn't have a full quarter of being in absolute crisis.
And for this moment, we've come through that and generated $9.5 billion of revenue and that's net of the deferred compensation plans which actually puts us bit over $10 billion in revenue, effectively flat to a year ago, I thought was remarkable.Now, maybe it's my job to think that's remarkable.
But it clearly puts us in a much better position.I think our BDP, which is our cheapest source of deposits, which currently have a cost of 1 basis point is now about 65% of the portfolio.
And I think our deposit costs at the end of the quarter were about 56 or 57 basis points, and those should come down a little bit as we've just repriced our savings product down in light of the rate environment.So, I would say we should, you know, if we have the opportunity to deploy those deposits into loans, we'll see a benefit there, clearly.
Appreciate it.Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- AnalystSo, could you speak a bit maybe -- Jon, you gave some color on the $49 billion HFI portfolio, which is helpful, thanks.
It's about 58% LTVs to the top tier borrowers in the real estate business and we have good protection in the asset.So, the forbearance has mostly been, Brennan, in the CRE book right now, and then again, a little bit in the residential mortgage that I mentioned.Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- AnalystYes. Okay.
Really appreciate that, Jon. So, how do you adjust to those things and what levers are you thinking to pull on the expense side here as the revenue -- if the revenue environment continues to get difficult?James P.
We, obviously, and just the timing of all of the events, we updated our models for what was going on at the time when we got to the end of the quarter in light of what we were seeing and the rapidly changing sort of the economic outlook, which at this point, I would say, and James has mentioned it a couple of times, the range of potential outcomes is the widest I've seen in quite some time in terms of what's going to happen in the future.And so, we relied heavily on the sort of qualitative and environmental reserve and we looked at the downgrades, we looked at what loans we thought would be downgraded, the stress draw scenarios, we did some loss given default sensitivities, we looked at criticized asset trends and we've factored all of that into our analysis that ultimately led to the $350 million reserve build on the entire portfolio, or a 74% increase from our Day-1 CECL.So, the economic scenarios are going to impact people differently across the plant.
Our Retail and Wealth business had very little reserve build given the performance in that portfolio in the company.
But we think the qualitative adjustments that we made are appropriate and brought our reserves to an appropriate level.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThanks, Jon. James, maybe a question for you.
As James said, you're going to take businesses where you trade and put with your clients, there's the potential to take losses.
I know we got to deal with lower rates and lower asset levels going down, but I'm just trying to get the right context.
I'm just looking for the right big picture, your view of wealth management.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, I think -- and James can jump in as well, but I've mentioned $500 million of negative revenue, so that puts the revenues in around $4.5 billion.
I was just wondering on the fixed side, any significant changes that you've seen in that business to try to gauge the outlook?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, it's very early in the quarter.
Jon, can you share with this -- I think you mentioned that coming out at the end of the quarter, in Wealth Management, 23% of your customers assets were in cash.
Over 90% of our employees are currently working from home as we continue to serve our clients globally.I frequently speak of the strength of Morgan Stanley's culture and our tenured leadership team.
With market function and liquidity essentially restored, clients are weighing the major factors at play, including significant unemployment and economic disruption versus monetary and fiscal actions larger than any others in history.During this period, the firm extended credit and intermediated trading, responding to client needs and supporting open and functioning markets.
We also saw approximately $13 billion gross drawdowns, $5 billion of new facilities in corporate lending and $3 billion retail commitments.We supported our clients by intermediate trading, including managing record volumes across voice and MSET.
Robust results in Sales and Trading were offset by mark-downs on held-for-sale loans, increased loan loss provision and lower levels of investment banking activity.
Non-compensation expenses increased 14%, driven by higher BC&E and transaction taxes on elevated sales and trading volumes and an ACL on unfunded commitments of $115 million.In the face of uncertain markets, we supported our institutional clients with insightful content.
First, underwriting activity was impacted as the global shelter-in-place action started to roll across the world, followed by significant volatility which dampened M&A dialog and announcements.Advisory revenues declined 45% sequentially, reflecting lower completed M&A industry volumes.
This was partially offset by an increase in accelerated primary offerings and secondary activity as we helped clients across the globe monetize equity stakes.Fixed income underwriting declined 11% versus the prior quarter.
Issuers continue to evaluate financing needs, looking to strengthen their balance sheets and raise liquidity.We have a strong pipeline across products and equity underwriting and a robust pipeline in investment grade and non-investment grade business, which are dependent on market access.
We would expect IPO activity to remain muted and we'll have to see whether other markets continue to open around the globe.Equity sales and trading is number-one globally and revenues increased 26% sequentially to $2.4 billion, with strong performance across all business lines and particular strength in Asia.Cash results were robust, reflecting the nearly 50% increase in global market volumes compared to the prior year.
The business benefited from higher levels of client activity and wider bid offer spreads.Micro revenues were more challenged and declined sequentially.
Strong commodity results were supported by increased client activity driven by meaningful swings in energy and metal prices.Other Sales and Trading increased significantly in the quarter.
Together, the ACL provision and mark-to-market, net of hedges, accounted for approximately $900 million of the aforementioned loss; and third, losses from investments associated with employee deferred cash-based compensation plans represent approximately $200 million of the law.Now, I will give some more color around our CECL provisioning for our $49 billion held-for-investment loan portfolio.
Client activity was extremely strong, reflecting high levels of engagement throughout the quarter as clients repositioned portfolios and moved into cash and other short-term securities.
Today, clients sold approximately 20% of assets in cash and short-term securities.Asset Management revenues increased slightly from the prior quarter.
Positive flows partially offset these lower asset levels.We had fee-based flows of $18 billion and generated strong net new assets at a pace above our historical run rate, highlighting the stability and health of this business.
Our growth strategy is working as clients are seeking professional advice during turbulent times, particularly with increased complexity.Strong loan growth continued in the first quarter.
We had extensive engagement with our global clients throughout the quarter and the business continued to see strong net flows despite the challenging environment.Total AUM rose 6% to $584 billion.
Total net flows of $57 billion benefited from a significant new long-term client partnership and our liquidity business.Asset management fees of $665 million declined 10% sequentially.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Christian.Christian Bolu -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystMy first question is on ROTCE for the firm, how to think about downside ROTCE?
I mean, given you are putting up 10% ROTCE in what is a very choppy backdrop, how should investors now think about the downside case for the firm is a 10% or close to 10% ROTCE now your bottom line as opposed to a couple of years ago what was your actual long-term target?James P.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHey, Steve.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystHey. I was hoping you could help us frame following the significant provision build that we saw in ISG this quarter.
And how do you see them bringing that down over the subsequent months or quarters?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerIt's a great question in terms of how our retail clients are going to reengage with the market.
