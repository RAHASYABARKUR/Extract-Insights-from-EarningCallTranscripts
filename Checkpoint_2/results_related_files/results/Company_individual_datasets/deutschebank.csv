deutschebank,q2,2019,"Again, these ratios are among the highest of all our European and global peers and provide a good base for our transformation.Most of the numbers we show you today will be based on our current business setup, but slide 3 gives a sense of our performance on a pro forma basis in the new reporting structure.
FIC, as I said before, actually performed a lot better than the headline revenue indicates given some specific items running against us, and I cannot see that this underlying solid performance is changing in the second half of 2019.Our successful transformation must be based on continued cost discipline.
Tangible book value per share of 24.49 euros declined by 5% compared to the prior quarter, principally reflecting the DTA item.In addition, as Christian noted, and as we show on slides 23 and 24, we have made certain refinements in our pro forma disclosures.
In aggregate, these refinements amount to approximately 550 million euros, or 2.5% of total core bank revenues, as originally laid out.These represent decisions taken by the newly established management team around the business perimeter, consistent with our overall strategic transformations.
We then look forward to giving you more details on our strategy on the Investor Day during Q4.To give you a better sense of our underlying performance this quarter, slide 9 shows the impacts of the strategic transformation and revised planning assumptions.
We also further rebalanced our business mix to more stable sources, as loan growth only partly offset the 17-billion-euro reduction in leverage exposure in our sales and trading operations.With that, let me now turn to our segment results based on the reporting structure prior to the strategic plan.
Excluding these impairments, non-interest expenses declined by 4%, with a 7% reduction in adjusted costs, reflecting the strategic actions taken in 2018 and continued cost discipline.Provisions for credit losses of 72 million euros remained at low levels, but did increase from the prior-year period.
Debt origination revenues declined, reflecting a weaker market environment, specifically in leveraged loans, where volumes decreased by approximately 50% compared to the prior-year quarter.
Equity sales and trading revenues declined 32% versus the prior year, driven by significant reductions in cash equities and prime finance, principally reflecting the uncertainty regarding our strategic decisions.Slide 15 shows the results of our private and commercial bank.
Revenues of 2.5 billion euros declined by 2% year on year on a reported basis, but grew by 2.2% in our ongoing businesses, excluding specific items.Non-interest expenses of 2.6 billion euros included impairments related to our strategic plan of 557 million euros.
This reflects the low-risk nature of our portfolios and the benefit of approximately 35 million euros of incremental gains on portfolio sales.Turning to revenues by business in PCB on slide 16, revenues in our ongoing businesses in PCB decreased by 1% on a reported basis, but grew by 2% excluding specific items.
Results included 239 million euros of valuation and timing differences, mainly reflecting the impact of cross-currency basis gains related to our U.S. dollar funding, as spreads widened during the quarter.During the second half of this year, we will roll out our new framework for funds transfer pricing, better aligning remuneration and charges with funding provision and usage across our businesses.
We expect these retained funding costs to result in contra-revenues of no more than 200-300 million euros in 2020, with offsetting improvements in our operating businesses.
Second, we must continue to demonstrate ongoing cost discipline as we work toward our 21.5-billion-euro adjusted cost target, excluding the adjusted cost items related to the strategic transformation.Our full-year guidance for provisions for credit losses remains unchanged.
My second question was really on potential rate cuts in Europe and tiering, and really, comparing this to the expectation on one of the slides a couple of weeks back when we talked about the new strategy, how your short-term rates should support revenues in two years or so.
So, firstly, I'd like to know whether the decision to keep parts of the equities business might actually end up undermining the argument to release the operational risk-weighted assets there, because as I understood it, the argument was that if it was a full exit, then you could delete the equities assumption from your op risk-weighted asset calculations, but if you're keeping another 550 million euros, just interested in your discussions with the regulator how that might affect those assumptions.And then, secondly, you said about 13% by year end, so with the extra 30 bps of headwinds you're going to see from regular inflation and restructuring from here, but the inflation you're talking about from -- was it slide 29 from the presentation a few weeks ago?
I think we have a strong competitive or franchise advantage in generating those loans, and while pricing is competitive in today's yield-starved environment, we have found good opportunities to put the balance sheet to work to support our clients.Magdalena Stoklosa -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorAnd James, geographically in CIB, is this across -- where do you see the best demand?James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerIt's global, but I'd say if there's a concentration or -- the opportunity is really in the U.S., so, in U.S. dollar product, and particularly, that's where the strength of those ABS and CRE franchises lies.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Stuart Graham of Autonomous Research.Stuart Graham -- Autonomous Research -- PartnerOh, hi.
Of course, some element of this 550 million euros would probably decline as it's exposed to the change associated with our equity sales and trading platform, but this gives us the opportunity to preserve as much as possible, and as Christian said earlier, preserve a coherent product capability for that core corporate client base going forward.
As part of our longer-term plan, the new management team and I set three objectives for 2019 in our announcement earlier this month.First, we must stabilize and grow revenues in our core bank, and today, we showed continuing signs of progress.
In our core investment bank, work has begun to stabilize the revenue base and build the foundation to drive returns higher.Second, this is the sixth quarter in a row where we reduced adjusted costs on a year-on-year basis when excluding the cost related to our strategic transformation and bank levies.
And, that leaves another 4%, which we are confident we can make up with our refocused investment bank, and given some of the leading indicators -- for instance, growth -- in our lending business.But, we offset the decline in revenues with reductions in adjusted cost, which also fell by 4%.
The increase in risk-weighted assets in the core bank mainly reflected loan growth and partly offset the 13-billion-euro decline in the Capital Release Unit.Revenues in our more controllable business of PCB, GTB, and asset management were broadly stable in the first half of 2019, excluding specific items, as shown on slide 4.
Our pipeline in leveraged debt capital markets has also increased slightly, and we expect to continue to grow our revenues in our lending businesses with credit rating reflecting the ongoing loan and asset growth we have generated.
To reach our recently lowered target of 25.1 billion euros for the full year, we must reduce our adjusted costs by a further 500 million euros in the second half to 10.2 billion euros, and based on our detailed bottom-up planning, we are confident that we can generate these savings from several areas.First, from the private bank in Germany, where we recently reached an agreement with the workers' council to restructure the head office and operations functions.
Turning to a summary of our second-quarter results on slide 8, revenues of 6.2 billion euros were down 6% year on year on a reported basis and by 5% excluding the specific items detailed on slide 21 of the presentation.
These changes adjust revenues allocated to the Capital Release Unit back to the core bank, while the risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure are in line with our original perimeter.
Risk-weighted assets were broadly flat, as growth in credit risk RWA and inflation from the regulatory review of internal models was offset by lower operational and market risk RWA, as well as by FX translation.In line with our previous guidance, we expect our CET1 ratio to be around 13% at the end of the year, including approximately 2 billion euros of impact on CET1 capital from the additional transformation charges and lower risk-weighted assets in the Capital Release Unit.
As you've seen in the first half of 2019, we grew revenues in PCB, GTB, and asset management despite the challenging environment, and the leading indicators, including loan growth and net flows, are positive, and we are confident that our refocused investment bank is on a good path given the strength of the franchises and the new strategic clarity.
And, the second question is given the change -- and also, a comment you made around the timing of the sale of the equities business to BNP -- how does it change, if at all, the planned runoff profile of risk-weighted assets and leverage out to 2022, and does it change your estimates at the endpoint?
Thanks.Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Jon. And, in the case of the refinements we are providing today, this represents a final set of parameter decisions and asset selections now, with the benefit of a more detailed input and decision-making on the part of the business leadership that is now in place.
Hence, the parameter represents materially the same degree of capital relief, but -- and, that was the driving factor, again, from a client point of view, but with less revenue loss.On the expense side, I defer to James, but we currently show no difference, as the net cost impact of the assets and activities going in and out of the CRU parameter were kind of broadly offsetting.
While this improves the core bank cost/income ratio slightly, it means, of course, we will need to execute effectively on both the de-risking and the expense takeout in the CRU to achieve the results we expect from the transformation overall.And, of course, it goes without saying we will report to you with additional detail when we publish our new financial data supplement, likely in early October, and then, even in greater detail in the Q3 earnings call, and ultimately, our Investor Day in Q4, when you will meet the management teams responsible for both the core bank and the CRU.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerSure, thank you.
We would estimate only about 1 billion euros of RWA difference between closing this year or next.Obviously, from a leverage exposure perspective, it's much more significant -- in the high 20s or low 30s -- but that, again, depends on how quickly we can move assets and novate client balances post, if you like, the legal closing of the transaction.
For the other questions, I refer to James.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, on MDA, our -- obviously, we're level this year at the 11.8%, but as we said on the 8th, it certainly is our hope and expectation that over time, our P2R will decline, reflecting, frankly, the transformed business model that we are moving toward.
So, the 12.7% is really just, in some ways, a starting point, and on the first end, we deliver and continue to manage the capital to preserve a buffer to that 12.5% throughout the year.Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive OfficerAndy, potentially one additional information on your first question, in particular with regard to the operational risk-weighted assets.
I was just wondering if you can update that number for the reclassification that was now made, and then, secondly, if you could give us the return on tangible for the core bank for the first half of this year as well.The second question I have is on the leverage exposure and risk-weighted assets in the CRU.
Clearly, things have moved very quickly post the end of the second quarter, which is obviously the scope of this presentation, but would it be possible to get an update or at least a steer as to where you are in the CRU leverage exposure in risk-weighted assets as things stand now, if there's been substantial movement post the announcement of the plan?The third question I have is just on BNP as a clarification question.
Obviously, those countermeasures go from relatively small impact on the franchise to greater and greater impact depending on the unexpected event, but the reality is a lot of what exists in planning is, frankly, expected, and so, by and large, we have the opportunity to adjust our plans on a timely basis, and that's what we're referring to when we talk about our robust preparations.Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive OfficerKian, to your second question, first of all, you cannot even believe what corporate clarity actually means to the bank.

deutschebank,q3,2019,"Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was stable in the quarter and at the high-end of our international peer group.Second, we said we would refocus our strategy on four core businesses which has strong positions in attractive markets and which are all profitable.
We continue to deploy balance sheet in our core lending franchises and benefited from strong capital markets activity, most notably in asset-backed securities and commercial real estate.And FX revenues were resilient in the phase of further declines and market volatility.
We are confident in reaching our full year target of reducing leverage exposure in the Capital Release Unit to around EUR120 billion.Our leverage target assumes that we closed the transfer unit with BNP Paribas for Prime Finance and Electronic Equities in the fourth quarter.
FX4Cash, our online real-time FX hedging tool developed in partnership between the corporate bank and the investment bank at its best revenue quarter ever.The good growth we showed in Wealth Management was in part driven by the performance of our family office and institutional wealth initiatives which are run in partnership with the investment bank.
This includes EUR234 million of restructuring and severance and just under EUR200 million of transformation related charges reported within our adjusted costs.Transformation charges in the quarter consisted primarily of software impairments as we implement our technology transformation to help reduce costs in future periods.
Excluding these benefits, provisions for credit losses increased, reflecting lower recoveries and higher provisions taken on defaulted and impaired exposures.Our net loss was EUR832 million, the negative tax rate includes EUR380 million of deferred tax asset valuation adjustments taken during the quarter that we anticipated and communicated to you when we launched our strategy in July.
Core bank pre-tax profit of EUR353 million included EUR315 million of restructuring and severance, transformation related charges and a negative impact from specific revenue items, all of which are detailed in the appendix.Core bank revenues were EUR5.6 billion, excluding specific items down 3% with around half of the decline coming from corporate and other.
Both risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure increased in the Core bank as we grew business volumes, including 9% loan growth year-on-year in selected core client segments.Turning to adjusted costs on Slide nine, we reduced adjusted costs by EUR296 million or 5% year-on-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and EUR186 million of transformation charges.
Excluding operational risk, de-risking in the Capital Release Unit generated almost 25 basis points of capital offset by around 16 [Phonetic] basis points of growth in the core bank and about 5 basis points of regulatory headwinds associated with the targeted review of internal models we have discussed previously.Together with the negative impact of our transformation charges on earnings, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was stable at 13.4%.
We reaffirm our target to manage our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio around 13% in the fourth quarter with the decline driven by multiple factors including transformation charges and updates to pension liabilities, including tax effects.
Our fully loaded leverage ratio was stable at 3.9% in the quarter despite a headwind from foreign exchange translation.On an exchange rate neutral basis, we reduced leverage exposure by EUR39 billion including EUR77 billion of de-leveraging in the Capital Release Unit.
Excluding these items, corporate bank revenues grew by around 2% on an underlying basis.Adjusted costs excluding transformation charges were EUR973 million flat to the prior quarter, but up substantially versus the prior year.
We set three objectives for our investment bank; stabilize revenues, reallocate resources and reduce costs and the management team made progress on all three this quarter.
The decline partly reflects around 500 in-voluntary leavers during the quarter, the run rate effect of strategic actions taken in recent periods and lower internal service cost allocations.Turning to the Investment Bank's revenue performance by business on Slide 15.
We believe the performance has now stabilized under new leadership with improved results in September.As Christian said, we are committed to maintaining robust and broad-based rates and emerging markets franchises and have taken specific actions to restructure these businesses.
Advisory revenues grew by more than 50% reflecting strong performance in the Americas, healthcare and industrials and benefited from the closing of certain deals originally expected in the fourth quarter.The outperformance versus the global fee pools was driven by strength in Debt Origination revenues with our leveraged loan and high yield businesses, both gaining market share in the quarter according to Dealogic.
Revenues declined by 2% adjusted for specific items as growth in business volumes partly offset the negative impact of lower interest rates.
We reduced adjusted costs excluding transformation charges by 1%.Synergy benefits from our German integration offset our ongoing investments in wealth management and higher internal service cost allocations.
We grew net new assets, net new loans and revenues, most notably in Asia and in the Americas and from our institutional wealth partnership and family office initiatives in conjunction with the investment bank.The growth in Wealth Management was in part driven by our select hiring programs where we've increased revenue generating staff by more than 10% in the last four quarters.
Despite the industry wide fee pressures, revenues were essentially flat year-on-year, excluding the negative impact of falling interest rates on the fair value of guarantees in select retirement products.Adjusted costs were down 6% excluding transformation charges reflecting successful delivery on cost initiatives.
So what -- just interested, what drove that increase and is that a seasonal, could that unwind into year-end at all.And then secondly on the private bank, the new time series that we all had made it seem like costs were going to come down much quicker than I guess it's partly a problem with getting used to that -- the new time series in any seasonality there perhaps, but underlying costs were up 3% quarter-on-quarter.The slides there referenced wealth management hiring.
What I'm trying to understand is how much will it cost you on average to reduce risk weighted assets, so we can clearly assume some kind of revenue reduction in our models, if you can help us with that.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerSure, Kian, thank you for the questions and I'll start on them and Christian may want to add.
Is there any relationship that you can put against risk weighted assets on any other context and if I just may ask one more time, the EUR600 million on interest rates, clearly the curve has moved further out from May. So if I would do a rerun of your numbers of how much come from interest rate, that number would be significantly bigger today than EUR600 million, is that correct?Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Management BoardSo the -- what we pulled aside in May as interest rate related or driven that would all, or most or more would disappear.
It's not really against the ongoing quarterly level of CLP that we're taking.Stuart Graham -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystOkay.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerStuart on your second question, it really comes down and plays down to our strengths and to our core DNA as a financing bank.
Today, we can tell you, we are on track, the trends in the core bank, the performance in the Capital Release Unit, headcount, costs and capital are all running in line with or better than we planned.The longer-term story will be a key part of what we discussed with you at the Investor Deep Dive on the 10th of December, I hope as many of you can join us for that.Today, I will focus on the progress we made in the quarter toward our four objectives for 2019, starting on Slide one.
And of course, the performance also reflects some impact from the fundamental transformation that we have launched in July.This quarter we need to look beneath the headline results.In the private bank, we offset most of the interest rate headwinds with solid growth in Wealth Management, and our International business.
We see this as a satisfactory result in particular, given the uncertainties around our strategy at the start of the quarter.Our transformation did have an impact on our performance in the Investment Bank, although the trends were in line with our internal targets and we believe that we are starting to -- that we are starting to put these issues of uncertainty now behind us.
Stripping out transformation related charges which James will discuss in a moment, our adjusted costs were EUR5.2 billion in the quarter, excluding these charges and bank levies, we recorded our seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year reductions and again, we are in-line with our plan and guidance we gave you last time, compared to the first quarter of 2018, we have reduced our quarterly adjusted costs by around EUR450 million or EUR1.8 billion on an annualized basis.
Adjusting for a specific items detailed on Slide 23 of the presentation, revenues were EUR5.4 billion in the quarter, down 12% year-on-year, the decline was driven by lower revenues in the capital release unit and corporate and other.
In Commercial Banking in Germany, revenues rose by 1% driven by loan growth of EUR4 billion, which helped offset the pressure of low or negative interest rates.With that, a few words on the Investment Bank on Slide 14.
In financing, our biggest business within FIC, revenues grew, reflecting increased client activity and the benefit of loan growth, I mentioned earlier.In flow credit, revenues rose year-on-year, as we started to benefit from investments in previous periods, while distressed debt trading revenues declined from a strong prior-year quarter and reflecting the episodic nature of that business.
In rates, results were impacted by our business restructuring and by the loss of EUR37 million on a specific investment as detailed on Slide 23 of the appendix.
Having generated approximately EUR150 million of cost synergies in the year-to-date, we are on track with the integration of our German operations.Provision for credit losses benefited from the factors I mentioned earlier and a 13 basis points of loans year-to-date remained at a low level, reflecting the low risk nature of our private bank portfolios.
We grew loans by EUR4 billion and assets under management also increased by EUR4 billion in the quarter.A few words on the revenue performance by business on Slide 17.
We reduced adjusted costs excluding transformation charges by 6% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower headcount and we've begun to implement our non-compensation cost reduction measures.We realize that the capital release unit is hard to model from the outside, so we want to give you a sense of what it will look like.
As we have said before, we are focused on growing revenues in our less market-sensitive businesses and building on the momentum we can see in the investment bank.Current market expectations for forward interest rates present a headwind to our revenue aspirations for 2022 that we outlined in our July presentation.
First, the perimeter adjustments we announced with the second quarter results, increased revenues in the core bank.Second, our businesses have begun more systematically pricing and charging for negative rates and the corporate bank and wealth management are well advanced working with clients on this.
Obviously, it's important, and we're very focused on maintaining a sufficient buffer above our MDA triggers, and hence the guidance we provided in terms of capital ranges and our minimum levels going forward.On the transformation charges, you're correct to point to page 25 in the July presentation, and as we look to 2020 and beyond, our view right now and our planning is entirely consistent with where we were in July.
You know, that in particular, in Europe, Deutsche Bank has always seen as a DNA as the corporate bank and to focus on that with its own division, with a strong financing business, with a strong transaction bank is obviously welcomed.We can -- in particular also see the bridge from Germany into Asia, by the way, that is partially an answer also to your third question that the internationality, which we can offer to the corporate's and which is unchanged and actually where we further invest into is highly welcomed and therefore I'm not only pleased about the 6% revenue increase which we saw in Q3, but I am confident that we see further revenue increases then going forward.On the institutional client side, the echo was also positive for the first reason, because we presented clarity.
And in Germany, to your question, this transaction bank also makes a difference actually versus our competitors, not only the one you mentioned, but also the other ones.I think the international business, we offer for the Corporate through the transaction bank is of a big competitive advantage, providing also for upside, obviously in the profitability and in the retail business or in the private banking business, we are even more focused on the affluent business and there we are more focused on the fee income business.
So it is a very granular and sort of individual discussion, hence my reticence about telling you the entire one-fifth, we'd actually execute on.I would also say in the period of time, leading up to and subsequent to the ECB action, I would say we do see a sort of a change in sentiment, especially in the German market where the market environment generally has begun to recognize that the banks can no longer shield clients from the -- the cost of the negative interest rate policy, and so the early days, the early experience in terms of client reaction would tell us, you're unlikely to see as big of an impact and an expectation that we have that some of this will be a broader market event than simply one banking house.Jernej Omahen -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThank you very much.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Jon Peace with Credit Suisse.
In the rounding, our 2022 revenue expectation was about EUR24.8 billion, we've talked about seeing obviously, interest rate related headwinds that we -- that we are suffering on a forward basis there.
Just as a reminder, our adjusted cost definition in ordinary circumstances includes things like amortization or impairments of software intangibles in certain of the real estate actions that we're taking, but given the size at the moment and the non-recurring nature, we've pulled those out and shown the impact of those charges quite transparently, and so you're right that the operating cost number would be about EUR1 billion higher than the EUR21.5 billion, ECB ex-transformation charges.On Basel 4, look, the implementation is dynamic in some respects.
But we continue to work toward the targets that we set in July.Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Management BoardThere's not a lot to add from my side, potentially, I mean on the private bank, on the revenue side as James was saying, I think we have intensified all our measures to reprice, but also again to increase our efforts to move deposits in other kind of investments, but also think about that obviously in order to compensate for potential headwinds, James and you were outlining, we also have a project under review to merge the PFK AG into DB AG.
And then obviously looking also for further measures.On the CRU de-risking costs, as you pointed out with the sort of specific items that we call out this quarter of DVA and a methodology, a valuation methodology adjustment on some positions in CRU, I don't think that this quarter is -- is going to be representative of de-risking costs as a percentage of the asset reduction.
So we wanted to be able to separate what we'd think of as underlying growth from loan growth from fee and commission income growth, from assets under management growth, essentially those non balance sheet items from the interest rate impact and that was the compound growth rate we were talking about.In terms of the revenue picture in CRU, the portfolio itself doesn't throw-off a significant amount of revenue, especially on the derivative side.
We have the strengths, we have the client franchise and in particular, it was the focus on this business, there is obviously even more demand.Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Management BoardStuart, one other just a thing to point out, is -- FX is a significant part of that growth.
I think we quite in detail said how much and how intense -- intensified we have our work on repricing, in particular in the Corporate Bank, but also in parts of the Private Bank.And now, while this is still 2.5 years or 3 years out, I'd tell you, if I simply look at the Q3 revenues in the Core Bank, including by the way in the investment bank and compare that to our internal plan numbers, we are clearly better than our internal plan.
And therefore, I think we are rightly set up and I'm confident that we can reach our targets there.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerSo Andrew, on balance sheet optimization, just a short answer to your LCR question, we published 139 this quarter, and we'd indicated in the past that we do see opportunity to continue to bring that lower, prudently, but toward more like 130.
So that's the first question.The second one is how should we think about the impact of the roll-off of the equity business in the transaction bank in particular?
",14.33,0.74935764
deutschebank,q4,2019,"We delivered our eighth quarter in a row of year-on-year reductions in adjusted costs excluding transformation charges and bank levies.
We promised adjusted costs of EUR21.5 billion excluding transformation charges and the impact of the Global Prime Finance transfer to BNP Paribas, and we delivered.
In the second half of 2019, the first six months of our strategic transformation, we have grown Core Bank revenues, excluding specific items, slightly compared to the prior year period.
Revenues in the Corporate Bank were flat as we grew loans principally in Germany and performed well in Asia to offset the ongoing impact of negative interest rates.
And as we said in the Investor Deep Dive, we started to actively reprice deposits in the fourth quarter, which should begin to offset some of the impact of negative interest rates during 2020.
We grew revenues in the investment bank by 7% in the second half and by 22% in the fourth quarter with a strong recovery in fixed income.
We offset the headwinds from negative interest rates with growth in loan and investment product revenues, repricing and benefits of hiring in Wealth Management in prior periods.
Excluding transformation charges, which James will detail shortly, adjusted costs were EUR5.1 billion in the fourth quarter and EUR21.5 billion for the full year also excluding the costs associated with the Prime Finance platform.
In this respect, we feel even more confident after the fourth quarter.We ended the year with a core Tier one ratio of 13.6%, comfortably meeting our prior guidance.
Given our performance on capital in 2019, we believe we are in an even stronger position to execute against our capital plan we announced in July 2019, and we have created some room to allocate additional capital to growing our core businesses.More broadly, we have been managing our balance sheet conservatively and intend to keep doing so, as you can see on slide seven.
We are also encouraged by the performance in the investment bank at the start of the year and are focused on further stabilizing revenues.
On capital, we look ahead with increasing confidence given our solid core Tier one ratio in the fourth quarter of 2019.
And with 70% of the expected total transformation effects now behind us, we are satisfied with what our teams have accomplished in this short time frame.With that, let me hand over to James.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Christian.
In the fourth quarter, revenues adjusted for specific items shown on slide 30 declined by 1%, reflecting the wind down of noncore businesses in the Capital Release Unit.
Tangible book value per share was EUR23.41, a 4% decline from the third quarter, mainly reflecting the net loss in the period.For the full year, we generated a pre-tax loss of EUR2.6 billion including EUR1.1 billion of transformation-related charges, EUR1 billion of goodwill impairment as well as EUR805 million in restructuring and severance and EUR473 million of litigation charges.
Operating leverage was positive in the quarter as we reduced adjusted costs excluding transformation charges by 2%.
We reaffirm our leverage ratio target of 4.5% this year, excluding the Prime Finance platform to be transferred, rising to around 5% for 2022.Turning now to our businesses starting with the Corporate Bank on slide 16.
Excluding specific revenue items and approximately EUR800 million of goodwill impairments, transformation charges and restructuring and severance which are detailed by business on slide 29 of the appendix, the Corporate Bank generated a pre-tax profit of EUR939 million in 2019 with a post-tax return on tangible equity of 7%.
However, the performance in the fourth quarter and full year was impacted by our strategic transformation, lower levels of episodic items and changes to cost allocations in addition to the challenging interest rate environment.
Adjusted costs, excluding transformation charges, increased materially in both the fourth quarter and the full year.
Adjusted costs, excluding transformation charges, declined in both the quarter and the full year.
Excluding specific revenue items and approximately EUR430 million of restructuring and severance and transformation charges, the Investment Bank generated a pre-tax profit of EUR863 million in 2019, with a post-tax return on tangible equity of 2%.Consistent with our strategy to invest in our core franchises, we grew loans by 16% in 2019.
The Private Bank continued to execute on its strategic priorities in the fourth quarter and full year, with revenues excluding specific items broadly stable and reductions in adjusted costs excluding transformation charges.
Excluding specific revenue items and approximately EUR900 million of restructuring and severance, goodwill and transformation charges, the Private Bank generated a pre-tax profit of EUR524 million in 2019 with a 3% post-tax return on tangible equity.Revenues in the fourth quarter and the full year were impacted by the negative interest rate headwinds, partly offset by growth in loans and assets under management and the benefits of repricing efforts.
Excluding transformation charges, we reduced adjusted costs by 5% in the quarter and 4% in the full year, including the EUR200 million in German merger cost synergies we had previously indicated.
Revenues in the Private Bank declined by 4% on a reported basis or 2% excluding specific items, as you can see on slide 21.
First, as described, to build on the momentum we have generated over the past two years and deliver on our 2020 adjusted cost target of EUR19.5 billion excluding transformation charges and the impact of the Prime Finance transfer.
Everything else that happens this year, whether it's deleveraging in the Capital Release Unit, some degree of losses from restructurings, earnings in the Core Bank and investments in balance sheet growth in the Core Bank, all of that nets out against that 13%.How big a buffer we carry against the 12.5% minimum, we're going to have to see based on both the timing of all of these events as well as, frankly, the market opportunities for the businesses to grow balance sheet to support client activity.
But we're obviously very cognizant that the market is looking for us to maintain a healthy buffer to the 12.5%.On the Corporate Bank, again, Christian will want to add, but as he mentioned, there are a lot of moving parts in that revenue line.
But we would argue that the underlying trends are just as they were in the third quarter with a little bit more transient pressure on interest rates given Central Bank actions in the second half; that, of course, will now work to offset given repricing, tiering and all the other items that we also described to you.
James all laid it out exactly to the point.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerAndy, I'm reminded -- sorry for the long answer, but you asked about the investment cycle in Corporate Bank, and I think this is also an important area to describe to you.
And as for the Corporate Bank, as I just lined out, there are other initiatives not only the active repricing where we have very constructive discussions with our clients and where we think we will see the first positive impact from the repricing in 2020, but also there, we have the underlying growth in the other business segments being the growth in Asia in Trade Finance and so on.
But by and large, you should focus on that EUR15 billion number that we gave you for reg inflation on the RWA line for 2020.Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive OfficerOn the costs on the Corporate Bank, we have seen higher adjusted costs mainly from higher technology costs and control costs, also changes in the way we have charged the internal services to the businesses.
How do you think about that as well?Christian Sewing -- Chief Executive OfficerLet me potentially start with my view on the Investment Bank, and then for the returns question, I hand over to James.
So last but not least, from a market share point of view, now let's wait, I think, for all the institutions coming out with the numbers for the fourth quarter including all Europeans.
But if you -- to answer your question, I think the core bank numbers excluding transformation charges is probably the best number to look at.
The way we've presented the transformation charges is intended -- and also by the way, the BNP Paribas transaction, which includes leverage and expenses is intended to give you a sense of all the things that then fall away by 2022, making 2022 pretty much a clean year barring small restructuring expense and obviously the net loss, if you like, or the loss mostly from expenses that remains in CRU that we want to lift from that point.
Outperformance against our group capital ratio targets was principally driven by asset reductions in the capital release unit where we overachieved against our external targets, thanks to good momentum toward the end of the quarter.Let me now go a little deeper into our 2019 performance on slide three.
Reflecting the improved performance in the fourth quarter, we held Core Bank revenues flat in 2019 and grew pre-tax profit by 7% excluding certain specific revenue and cost items which James will detail shortly.
Asset Management continued its recovery with revenues up 12% in the second half reflecting higher performance fees in certain core funds.
Outperformance on the core Tier one ratio largely reflects stronger-than-anticipated risk-weighted asset reductions in the Capital Release Unit.
Our net loss in the fourth quarter was a little under EUR1.5 billion including approximately EUR400 million of transformation-related deferred tax asset valuation adjustments.
Provision for credit losses was EUR723 million in line with our expectations; and at 17 basis points of loans, remained relatively low.
Our net loss of EUR5.3 billion included EUR2.8 billion of transformation-related deferred tax asset valuation adjustments also in line with our expectations.
In the fourth quarter, we reduced adjusted costs by around EUR380 million or 7% year-on-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and the transformation charges I described earlier.Adjusted costs included EUR102 million of expenses incurred in the fourth quarter associated with the Prime Finance platform being transferred to BNP Paribas, which are reimbursable from December 2019 onwards.
We increased our CET1 ratio by 24 basis points in the quarter to 13.6% as we more than offset the transformation effects with derisking in the Capital Release Unit.Reductions in risk-weighted assets generated 73 basis points of capital on an exchange rate-neutral basis, including approximately 41 basis points from the CRU and approximately 20 basis points from lower market risk in our Core Bank.
Excluding these items like credit recoveries and certain smaller one-off gains which we've discussed with you in previous calls, Corporate Bank revenues were broadly flat as we grew volumes and fee income to offset the impact of lower net interest income principally in cash management.For the full year too, revenues were broadly flat.
Within Global Transaction Banking, cash management revenues declined, reflecting the impact of the negative interest rate environment with very limited benefits of tiering or repricing in the period.
Trade Finance revenues were essentially flat in the quarter but up 6% for the full year as lending and trade flows grew strongly in Asia and Germany.Securities Services revenues declined, reflecting our exit from equities trading and lower episodic items.
Revenues in Fixed Income Sales & Trading were EUR1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, a 31% year-on-year increase on a reported basis, or 34%, excluding specific items as shown on slide 19.
In Emerging Markets, our structured businesses continued to perform well, with a significantly improved performance in Flow Trading compared to the prior year.Origination & Advisory revenues declined by 12% year-on-year relative to a strong prior year period.
Provision for credit losses was broadly stable in the full year and at 15 basis points of loans reflects the conservative nature of our portfolios and strong underwriting standards.
Revenues in Germany declined by 7% primarily reflecting higher funding and liquidity related costs as well as lower contributions from asset sale transactions.
Excluding restructuring and severance and transformation charges, asset management pre-tax profit of EUR539 million increased by 31% year-on-year despite higher noncontrolling interests following the IPO in the first quarter of 2018.
Assets Under Management were EUR768 billion at quarter end, up by EUR103 billion or 16% during the year.The growth in AUM was driven both by market performance and four consecutive quarters of net inflows.
As a result of the strong revenue performance and cost discipline, Asset Management generated significant positive operating leverage with a six percentage point improvement in the full year cost/income ratio to 73% on a segment basis.
Management fees grew by 6% year-on-year reflecting the strong market conditions and consecutive quarters of net inflows which more than offset the impact of margin compression.
Leverage exposure declined by EUR50 billion in the quarter mainly driven by reductions in equities.Before I close, a few words on our 2020 financial targets on slide 26.
And third, to raise our fully loaded leverage ratio to 4.5% excluding the balances we hold for BNP Paribas and Prime Finance, principally reflecting the further deleveraging by the Capital Release Unit Consistent with our previous guidance, we expect provisions for credit losses to increase to around 20 basis points of loans in 2020 reflecting a continued normalization of credit and lower recoveries.
Looking further ahead, the progress toward our short-term financial objectives gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2022 targets, including a post-tax return on tangible equity of 8%.With that, let me hand back to James, and we look forward to your questions.James Rivett -- Head of Investor RelationsStuart, let's now open the lines for questions.Questions and Answers:Operator[Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Andy Stimpson of Bank of America.
I'm just wondering what the moving parts are from here and whether there was a bit more seasonality in the risk-weighted assets this quarter that you'd expect to come back in the first quarter or why or if there's more inflation or why not think that you could be above that 12.7% trough level during 2020.
And we are confident that we will show satisfactory results and revenues going forward.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerOn the EUR19.5 billion cost target, I would just say many, many things need to continue to happen across the organization as we continue on our cost discipline and this sort of run rate decline that we have exhibited for the past eight quarters.

deutschebank,q1,2020,"Absolutely not, but with the right strategy, scale and leading franchises globally, a relentless focus on execution, strong balance sheet and with Germany as our home market we believe that Deutsche Bank can strengthen its competitive position in these difficult times.
Core Bank pre-tax profit grew by 32% year-on-year to EUR1.1 billion, excluding specific revenue items, restructuring and severance and transformation charges.
The team continue to actively reprice deposits in the first quarter and this puts us on a good track to pass-through negative interest rates to EUR25 billion of deposits in 2020 as part of our 2022 targets.The Investment Bank grew revenues by 15% with revenues up in both Fixed Income and Origination & Advisory.
We increased market share in our European and German franchise to the highest level since 2017.In the Private Bank, revenues increased by 3%, this growth was supported by the strong performance in Wealth Management, where strategic hiring in prior periods has started to pay off, again consistent with what we told you in December.
In Asset Management, growth in management fees was offset by interest rate driven changes in the fair value of certain guaranteed funds, despite the market conditions at the end of the quarter DWS has continued to grow assets in core areas, most notably through strategic partnerships and ESG funds.
The Corporate Bank also made progress on its strategic initiatives and benefited from reorganization measures implemented last year with particular focus on efficiency optimization in Germany and across infrastructure functions.In the Investment Bank, cost declined by 15% in part driven by the front office headcount reductions implemented in 2019, as well as lower internal service cost allocations.
As we made clear in our release on Sunday night, it is our deliberate decision and Deutsche Bank's priority to standby its clients without compromising on capital strength.We kept our liquidity position strong at EUR205 billion comfortably above regulatory requirements, while providing an additional EUR25 billion in loans to our clients.
In this regard, we are uniquely positioned to provide clients access to the services they need in a timely and efficient way.Since mid-March the Investment Bank has helped corporate and government clients, raise EUR150 billion of debt to fund their financing needs.
This positions us well to meet a temporary increase in client demand for balance sheet commitments over the next few quarters.As Germany's leading international bank, we also believe we operate from a solid macroeconomic and political backdrop.
Our capital includes a net EUR400 million of incremental prudent valuation deductions, reflecting increased pricing dispersion and wider spreads, driven by the market volatility in the latter part of the quarter.COVID-19 driven increases in risk-weighted assets of EUR7 billion, included higher credit risk RWA, due to ratings migrations and EUR5 billion from drawdowns on credit facilities.
The drawdowns on credit facilities also reduced our liquidity reserves by EUR17 billion and were primarily in our corporate relationship lending portfolio and leverage debt capital markets.
We would also expect for credit risk RWA to return to more normal levels as clients replaced drawn facilities with cheaper long-term funding.Turning to provisions for credit losses on Slide 12.
As I just mentioned roughly half of the provisions relate to COVID-19 impacts, principally against Stage 1 and Stage 2 performing loans, most of the increase was driven by updates to macroeconomic variables, changes in credit ratings in segments particularly impacted by the crisis, as well as higher drawdowns.
Excluding Central Bank cash for leverage exposure, consistent with the European Commission's proposal published yesterday would, if implemented, increase our leverage ratio by approximately 20 basis points.Turning now to liquidity on Slide 15.
Liquidity reserves declined by EUR17 billion in the quarter, reflecting drawdowns on committed credit facilities.
In the remaining three quarters of this year we expect to take an incremental EUR800 million of pre-tax charges, including EUR200 million of accelerated software amortization, which is not relevant for capital purposes.The progress we are making on our transformation agenda is increasingly visible in our cost performance as shown on Slide 17.
We made progress in all major cost categories, compensation and benefits expenses fell in line with the reductions in internal workforce; IT costs declined reflecting the lower amortization given the impairments taken in 2019, while our cash IT spend was broadly stable and within our target range as we continue our investment program.
Other cost declined, reflecting reductions across a number of areas; including occupancy.With that let us turn to our segments, starting with the Corporate Bank on Slide 19.
The Corporate Bank made further progress on it's strategic priorities this quarter, including continued progress on deposit pricing measures to offset the challenging interest rate environment.
Provisions for credit losses were EUR106 million for the quarter and mainly related to a few single name events, as well as the updated macroeconomic environment.
Securities Services revenues declined, reflecting the non-recurrence of a one-time gain in the prior year period, while Trust and Agency Services decreased as a result of US interest rate cuts and lower client activity.
Revenues in Fixed Income Sales & Trading increased by 16% year-on-year, excluding specific items, as shown on Slide 22.Strong performance in rates, FX and emerging markets offset the exceptionally challenging market conditions at the end of the quarter in credit.
The Private Bank reported a pre-tax profit of EUR132 million in the quarter, excluding specific revenue items, restructuring and severance, as well as transformation charges, pre-tax was EUR197 million with an adjusted post-tax return on tangible equity of 5% excluding bank levies.
The Private Bank continued to execute on its strategic transformation, consistent with our strategy we continue to grow loans and fee income to offset the ongoing headwinds from negative interest rates.Our new business generation continued in the quarter as we grew net new client loans by EUR2 billion and generated net inflows of EUR4 billion into investment products.
In the first quarter, we grew fee income from investment products, reflecting the success of targeted product initiatives and grew loans by EUR2 billion, notably in mortgages.PCB International revenues increased by 3%, higher loan and investment product revenues combined with repricing measures more than offset interest rate headwinds and the initial impacts of the COVID-19 related slowdown in client activity, mainly in Italy and Spain, we grew revenues in wealth management by 17%, excluding workout activities.
As you say it's temporary, I'm not sure it changes necessarily our strategic thinking about the balance sheet, but certainly it helps us report higher ratios and maybe look at the use of the leverage balance sheet a little bit differently, but obviously only over the temporary period.
We're obviously alive to the comparison, but we think again, looking at our detailed modeling, they're very good reasons to see this as quite different in terms of likely outcome relative to that stress test.Jernej Omahen -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystCan I just maybe just ask one follow-on.
So I was just wondering, let's assume that you're wrong, and the credit loss is not 45, but it's closer to EBAs estimate of 80, what are those dynamic actions that the bank can take to offset this event?James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, let me again just let me again start with the comparison.
So maybe you could just expand on that?And the second question is just around the restructuring and severance charge this quarter, which I think was EUR88 million.
And hence, I think we have good handling on this EUR51 billion portfolio in total.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd, one just thing to add to what Christian said.
And actually thinking about what can we implement now long-term and that will also result in cost reductions, and that combined with the track record this Management Board has build makes us confident to achieve the 19.5% or even be better than that.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerSo -- and I'll take the question about reserving.
We have not let the recent turbulence distract us and we have continued to execute in a disciplined manner against our cost targets.As a result we reduced adjusted costs excluding transformation charges and bank levies for the ninth quarter in a row on a year-on-year basis.
Adjusted grew pre-tax profit increased as lower costs and higher Core Bank revenues offset the higher provisions for credit losses and the drag from the Capital Release Unit.In the Core Bank, the combination of revenue growth and lower costs generated significant positive operating leverage in the quarter.
Excluding transformation charges and bank levies, adjusted costs declined by 7% year-on-year to EUR4.9 billion, our ninth quarter in a row of reductions.
The progress we have made in the first quarter and the projects under way put us on a good path to achieve or outperform our EUR19.5 billion target for 2020.Turning now to the Core Bank starting on Slide 4.
And in our German and International businesses, we have continued to grow loans and volumes to broadly offset the ongoing interest rate headwinds, this includes the conversion of deposits into investment products with the EUR4 billion net inflow in the quarter.
We are the leading retail bank with 19 million customers and the leading retail asset manager.We also believe that Germany is relatively well positioned, thanks to the strong and decisive actions of the government, the German support programs of around EUR730 billion amounting to around 22% of total GDP at the highest of any major country.
In the first quarter revenues were flat year-on-year with growth in the Core Bank offsetting the wind down of non-core businesses in the Capital Release Unit.
Non-interest expenses of EUR5.6 billion, included EUR503 million of bank levies in the quarter, as well as approximately EUR190 million of restructuring and severance, litigation and transformation charges.On a reported basis, the Group generated positive operating leverage of 5%.
Provision for credit losses increased to EUR506 million or the equivalent of 44 basis points of loans on an annualized basis.
Our results in the quarter were impacted both by our ongoing actions to implement our transformation, as well as the initial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most material of which we detail starting on Slide 11.In the first quarter, our provisions for credit losses included approximately EUR260 million of incremental charges, which I will discuss shortly.
Our forecasts were based on consensus estimates at the end of March, updating the assumptions to the current market views would have increased our provisions for credit losses by approximately EUR100 million.
Including the provisions taken in the first quarter, we ended the period with EUR4.9 billion of total allowances for credit losses.
In line with our stated strategy, we also continue to fund our business growth, which consumed roughly 10 basis points of capital in the quarter.
Our leverage ratio was 4% at quarter end, a decline of 21 basis points, principally from the COVID-19 related effects.
And our excess liquidity and stable sources of funding provide us with a solid foundation as we look forward.As Christian has said, we continued our strategic transformation in the first quarter, as you can see on Slide 16, results in the quarter included EUR177 million of transformation effects, including EUR4 million of transformation-related charges, which form part of our definition of adjusted costs.
Pre-tax profit of the Corporate Bank was EUR132 million in the quarter, excluding transformation charges and restructuring and severance, which we detailed by business on Slide 34 of the appendix.
At the end of the first quarter, we had charging agreements in place for approximately EUR40 billion of deposits, and are well on track to the targets we set at the Investor Deep Dive in December.Non-interest expenses increased year-on-year, in part reflecting higher transformation charges.
Adjusted costs excluding transformation charges also increased, mainly reflecting the change in internal service cost allocations that we discussed with you in the second half of last year.
Risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure increased in the quarter, mainly reflecting client drawdowns on credit facilities.Turning to the Corporate Bank revenue performance by business on Slide 20.
Revenues of EUR2.3 billion grew by 15% year-on-year, excluding specific items, driven by strong market conditions early in the quarter, as well as further growth in our client franchises.
Provision for credit losses of EUR243 million or the equivalent of 111 basis points of loans increased in the quarter, driven by the deteriorating market outlook.
Across rates FX and emerging markets, revenues were also supported by the benefits of our refocused strategy that we laid out in December with continued improvements in client engagement and strong growth in our institutional and corporate franchises.In credit revenues declined, reflecting the challenging market conditions in March, which were only partly offset by effective risk management and a strong performance at the start of the year.
Revenues in the Private Bank increased in the quarter, principally driven by a strong performance in Wealth Management, where we benefited from increased client activity and our relationship manager hires in prior periods.Non-interest expenses increased by 5% year-on-year, reflecting higher restructuring charges as we implement our cost reduction programs.
Provisions for credit losses were EUR139 million or 24 basis points of loans, reflecting the normalization of provisions we have previously discussed.
Revenues of EUR2.2 billion increased by 2% on a reported basis and by 3% year-on-year, excluding specific items, as shown on Slide 24.Revenues in Germany declined by 1%, reflecting the higher funding and liquidity costs that we discussed with you last quarter.
Asset Management reported a pre-tax profit of EUR110 million in the quarter, an increase of 14% from the prior-year period, mainly driven by lower costs with revenues broadly flat.
By product net outflows in fixed income and passive in the quarter were partly offset by net inflows in cash, equity and alternatives.As shown on Slide 26, Asset Management revenues were broadly flat to last year as the growth in management fees was offset by the change in fair value of guarantees, driven by the low interest rate environment.
Over time as client demand normalizes and we execute on the deleveraging program in the Capital Release Unit, we believe that we will restore our glide path to a leverage ratio of around 5%.Third, on adjusted costs.
We've also updated our outlook statements in the earnings report to reflect our current expectations for revenues this year, both the Group and business line level.
And hence we simply can see clients are reengaging, reentering with us and that's our focus.And in this regard, I do believe with the basic understanding that I think the heat of the crisis, we will see, obviously in Q1 and Q2, but looking at the revenue development of the four -- first four months, I'm confident that we can achieve the goal, which we outlined before.
When I was at that point in time, in the credit risk management team, the average equity position, the average liquidity, which was on the balance sheet of the corporates is not comparable to the one we see right now.
There's been, as you saw in our disclosure Page 12, is very little that we would see as COVID-related Stage 3 provisions taken this quarter, which we think is entirely natural for the very short-time elapse between the onset of the crisis and the end of the quarter.To your question about the macro assumptions, we use consensus estimates in that, build those into our models.
Thank you.James von Moltke -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, Stuart, I actually don't have the -- to hand the exact number of credit risk RWA increases that we see for the balance of the year.
