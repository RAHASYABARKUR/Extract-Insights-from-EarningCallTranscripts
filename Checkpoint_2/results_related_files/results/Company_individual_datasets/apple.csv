apple,q1,2018,"Prepared Remarks:OperatorGood day and welcome to this Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.I'd like to remind you that the quarter we're reporting today included 13 weeks, whereas the quarter we reported a year ago included 14 weeks.
Our teams carried out an extremely complex launch from both an engineering and operations perspective, executing an outstanding product ramp that required years of research and development.
Sales of Apple Watch Series 3 models were also more than twice the volume of Series 2 a year ago.
We sold 13.2 million units with average iPad sales per week up 8% over last year's December quarter.
Intesa Sanpaolo will deploy native apps to improve employee productivity in customer support, human resources, and marketing across the company.At LensCrafters, one of the largest optical retail brands in North America, will be using over 7,000 iPad Pros to enable digital eye exams and digital optical measurements in a personalized, interactive experience.We're also rolling out a new initiative called Apple At Work to help businesses implement employee-choice programs more easily and offer Apple products company wide.
We launched a new $5 billion-dollar ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 23.6 million shares, and we'll retire 3.8 million shares upon the completion of our 12th ASR during the quarter.We have now completed over 248 billion of our 300 billion capital return program including 176 billion in share repurchases against our announced 210 billion buyback program with 34 billion remaining under our current authorization.Turning to taxes, due to the recently enacted legislation in the US, we estimate making a corporate income tax payment of approximately $38 billion to the US government on our accumulative past foreign earnings.
Thank you for your participation.Duration: 61 minutesCall participants:Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsTimothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerLuca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerShannon S.
After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.Please not that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook.
It's also fueling tremendous growth in our services business, which I'll talk about a little later in the call.Turning to the December quarter, we're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings.
Our customers love these new features, and the new gestures like simply swiping up from the bottom, which made using iPhone even more intuitive and enjoyable.Our team has put the technology of tomorrow in our customers' hands today, set the standard for the next decade of smartphones, and we are very proud of their achievements.It was another very strong quarter for services, with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 18% over last year, and we're on pace to achieve our goal of doubling our 2016 services revenue by 2020.
Together with Apple Music, HomePod gives you instant access to one of the world's largest music catalogs, and with the intelligence of Siri, it's a powerful assistant you control through natural voice interaction.We're very happy with the initial response from reviewers who experienced HomePod ahead of its launch, and we think our customers are going to love this new product.We believe one of the key issues of the 21st century is education, and because of that, we've strengthened our commitment and investment into initiatives like Everyone Can Code.
When we look at average revenue per week, our growth rate was even higher at 21% with growth across all product categories for the third consecutive quarter.Our results were terrific all around the world, with double-digit revenue growth in all our geographic segments, and all-time quarterly records in the vast majority of markets we track including the US, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and Korea, as well as mainland China, Latin America, the Middle East, central and eastern Europe, and India.
We established all-time iPhone revenue records in nearly every market we track and double-digit growth in all of our geographic segments.iPhone ASP increased to $796, from $695 a year ago, driven primarily by the launch of iPhone X and the success of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.We exited the December quarter toward the lower end of our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory, with less than 1 million less iPhones in the channel compared to the December quarter a year ago, in line with our goals in average weekly unit sales.Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very, very strong for both consumers and business users.
Among business customers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 77% plan to purchase iPhone.Our customers are also incredibly loyal, with Kantar's latest US research reflecting a 96% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured.Turning to services, we had a terrific quarter with revenue of 8.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year, and up 27% in terms of average revenue per week.
That is an acceleration to the 24% services growth run rate that we experienced in the September quarter.The App Store set a new all-time revenue record.
During the week beginning December 24, a record number of customers made purchases or downloaded apps from the app store, spending over 890 million in that 7-day period, followed by 300 million in purchases on New Year's Day alone.According to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases by a very wide margin, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play.Across all of our services offerings, paid subscriptions reached 240 million with growth of 58% over last year, and they were a major contributor to the overall strong growth in services revenue.As Tim mentioned, it was our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, and when we add the results from Beats and AirPods, our total revenue from wearables was up almost 70% year-over-year.
In fact, wearables were the second-largest contributors to revenue growth after iPhone, which is impressive for a business that started only three years ago.In total, our Other Products category set a new all-time record with quarterly revenue exceeding $5 billion for the first time.Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.1 million Macs during the December quarter, which translates to a 2% year-over-year increase in average sales per week.
On a worldwide basis, the active installed base of Macs was up double-digits year-over-year to a new record.It was also another growth quarter for iPad. iPad sales drew strong double-digits in many emerging markets including Latin America, the Middle East, central and eastern Europe, and India, as well as developed markets including Japan, Australia, and Korea.The active installed base of iPad has grown every quarter since its launch in 2010, and it reached a new all-time high in December thanks to extremely high customer loyalty and large numbers of first-time iPad users.NPD indicates that iPad has 46% share of the US tablet market in the December quarter, up from 36% share a year ago, and the most recent surveys from 451 Research found that among customers planning to purchase tablets within 90 days, 72% of consumers and 68% of business users plan to purchase iPads.
Traffic was particularly strong during the full weeks following the launch of iPhone X, up 46% over last year, and across the quarter, our stores conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple sessions covering topics including photography, music, gaming and app development, and art and design.Just last weekend, we opened our first store in Seoul, Korea, and we're looking forward to opening our first store in Austria in a few weeks.
Including the 38 billion payment, we will have paid over $110 billion of corporate income tax on our total domestic and foreign earnings during the last 10 years, for a cash tax rate of about 26%.Our tax rate of 25.8% for the December quarter was close to our guidance of 25.5% at the lower US pass-through rate from the new legislation was effectively offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax balances.As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
We will provide an update to our specific capital allocation plans when we report results for our second fiscal quarter consistent with the timing of our updates that we have provided in the past.Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable on February 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2018.With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director Investor RelationsThank you, Luca.
I realize you don't want to give us any specifics about what you're actually going to return and the timing, but just maybe if you could talk about how much cash I guess you think you need to have to run the business, and then in terms of ongoing cash flow, since the overseas cash will no longer be encumbered, does that change your thought process in general?
As I said earlier, we will be discussing capital allocation plans when we review our March quarter results, and when you look at our track record of what we've done over the last several years, you've seen that effectively we were returning to our investors essentially about 100% of our free cash flow.
The revenue growth from iPhone across all the geographic segments was in the double digits, and I think as Luca said earlier, when you change that to an average weekly sales basis, it's actually 22%.
Growing double digits off such a large revenue base is impressive in itself, but if I look at March quarter guidance, it does assume a slower average weekly growth in total revenue as well as I think, my math, I found shipments when you compare it to the December quarter.
This is at the macro level.We typically don't go into this level of detail, but think it's important this quarter to give you additional color, and maybe the two most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as compared to last year during the March quarter, and also and importantly that iPhone sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis, would be actually accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December quarter.Let me explain the factors that we took into consideration as we came up with our iPhone units and AHD that are embedded into our guidance.
Certainly, weaker dollar in the long term if it holds, will be a positive, but it's not something that you're gonna be seeing translate into gross margin tailwind quickly, and so I think we have to keep that in mind.We also need to keep in mind that we continue to experience a difficult memory tracking environment, which we think is gonna start improving as we move into the second half of our fiscal year, but it still has a negative impact in the March quarter.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director Investor RelationsThank you, Katy.
And then, believe it or not, I have a follow-up.Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive Officer I think it's up to investors as to what things they would like to focus on, so I don't wanna put myself in the position of that.
You often give us switchers.Timothy Donald Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerIt is so early on this product cycle, particularly with the iPhone X only starting in November, that we do not feel we have data at this point that would be very meaningful to share, and so I'll punt that question until next time around.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Laura.

apple,q2,2018,"After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, share repurchases, dividends, and future business outlook.
We had all-time record revenue from the app store from Apple Music, from iCloud, from Apple Pay, and more, all of which are a powerful illustration of the importance of our huge active installed base of devices and the loyalty and engagement of our customers.Across all our services, paid subscriptions surpassed 270 million, up over 100 million from a year ago, and up 30 million in the last 90 days alone, contributing to the overall increase in services revenue.
With the launch of Brazil in April, Apple Pay is now available in 21 markets, and we expect Norway, Poland, and Ukraine to launch in the next several months.This was another outstanding quarter for our wearables business, which includes Apple Watch, Beats, and AirPods, with combined revenue of almost 50% year-over-year.
It's currently available in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, and we're looking forward to adding new features to HomePod and introducing it to more markets around the world soon.In March, we announced new products for the education community, including updating our most popular iPad with support for Apple Pencil.
During the quarter, we sold 52.2 million iPhones, up 3% over last year, and we grew iPhone units by double digits in several markets, including Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico, and Vietnam.
And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPhones.Turning to services, we had a sensational quarter, with all-time record revenue of $9.2 billion.
And that's up more than $2 billion from last year, an increase of 31%, and double the services revenue we generated in the March quarter just four years ago.
When we combined all our wearables and home products, they accounted for over 90% of the total growth in the other products category.Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac, which set a new March quarter revenue record, including new records in both the Americas and Greater China.
Year-over-year growth was led by iPhone, as well as strong performance from AirPods and the introduction of HomePod. During the quarter, we opened beautiful new stores in South Korea and in Austria, our first in both countries, and three weeks ago, we opened our newest store in Tokyo, bringing us to 502 stores across the world today.Let me now turn to our cash position.
As we said in February, our goal is to become approximately net cash neutral over time.Given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value that we see in our stock, our board has authorized a new $100 billion share repurchase program, which we will start executing during the June quarter.
With over $13 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be among the largest dividend payers in the world, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward.We will continue to review our capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, our investment opportunities, and our financial outlook.
We expect to provide a new update to our capital allocation plans approximately 12 months from now.As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
Given the $1,000.00 price point, and it's clearly selling, but there's been a lot of questions in the market about the sustainability of that price point and how you're thinking about it as you look out sort of holistically across your lineup.
I think that our iPhone line shows that there's a variety of different customers in a market that is as large as the smartphone market, and so we're going to continue to provide different iPhones for folks to meet their needs.On iPhone X specifically, I think it's important to maybe emphasize again one of the things I mentioned in my opening comments, that customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each and every week in the March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter.
What's driving that, and how are you thinking about -- I mean, it's one of the uses of cash, obviously, so how are you thinking about inventory and maybe working capital in general as you're going forward?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
And so, that's our focus, and I'm optimistic that -- I don't know every play by play that will happen, but over time, I think that view will prevail.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Katy.
And I think the other good news is that because our active installed base is at such a level that -- last quarter we said that we'd exceeded 1.3 billion.
But we believe that given where we are with the valuation of the stock, we think that we continue to do the buyback primarily.We are not giving an end date to the program this time because the amount is very, very large, and so, we will try to execute it -- as you've seen from our track record during the last five years, we will do it at a very fast pace, but we also want to do it efficiently.
And I have a follow-up for Luca, please.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerWe price for the value that we're delivering, and iPhone X is the most innovative product on the market.
iPhone's second quarter performance capped a tremendous fiscal first half, with $100 billion in iPhone revenue, an increase of $12 billion over last year, setting a new first half record and achieving our highest first half growth rate in three years.iPhone gained share during the quarter based on IDC's latest estimates for the global smartphone market.
Looking at its revenue over the last four quarters, our wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 300 company.Apple Watch had another great quarter, with revenue growing by strong double digits year-over-year to a new March quarter record.
We believe education is the great equalizer, and whether it's through our coding programs, our unrivaled augmented reality platform, or the creativity both can unleash, we're proud to help students everywhere reach new frontiers of learning with Apple technology.In March, we also released iOS 11.3, a major update offering new immersive augmented reality experiences, access to personal health records in the Health app, and more.
We're narrowing the site selection for a new U.S. campus, and we look forward to sharing more information on that later this year.Consistent with our annual cadence, today we're providing an update on our capital return program.
Tax reform makes it possible for us to execute our program more efficiently, both through share repurchases and payment of dividend to the tens of millions of investors who own Apple stock either directly or indirectly, from large pension funds to individuals with a retirement account.
Our Board of Directors has approved a new $100 billion share repurchase authorization, as well as a 16% in our quarterly dividend, effective with our next dividend payable later this month.Luca will provide more details about our program, as well as a more in-depth discussion of the quarter's results.
Performance was very strong in emerging markets, where revenue was up 20%, and we were especially pleased to see 21% year-over-year growth in Greater China, our strongest growth rate from that segment in ten quarters.
Diluted earnings per share were $2.73, up 30% to our new record for Q2, and cash flow from operations was very strong, at $15.1 billion.iPhone revenue grew 14% year-over-year, with iPhone ASP increasing to $728.00 from $655.00 a year ago, driven primarily by the performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus.
Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was even stronger than our reported results, as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.8 million units, 600,000 units more than the March quarter reduction last year.
We were happy to see double-digit growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high, with almost 60% of March quarter purchases coming from customers who are new to Mac.iPad grew both units and revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter.
We are thrilled that insurance industry leaders recognized that Apple products provide superior security.In March, we announced two new services with IBM to bring more dynamic and intelligent insights into apps.
In fact, HCA Healthcare recently announced they plan to deploy 100,00 iPhones across their hospital sites within the next three years.We had great performance from our retail and online stores, which produced their highest March quarter revenue ever.
As in the past, we will provide regular updates on our capital return activities at the end of every quarter.We're also raising our dividend for the sixth time in less than six years, as we know it is very important to our investors who value income.

apple,q3,2018,"Today we're proud to report our best June quarter revenue and earnings ever thanks to the strong performance of iPhone services and wearables.
Based on the latest data from IDC, iPhone grew faster than the global smartphone market-gaining share in many markets including the US, greater China, Canada, Germany, Australia, Russia, Mexico, and the Middle East and Africa.Second, we had a stellar quarter in services, which generated an all-time record revenue of 9.5 billion fueled in part by double-digit growth in our overall active installed base.
Apple Pay Cash, our peer-to-peer payment service, is already serving millions of customers across the US, less than eight months following its launch.Our third highlight of the quarter is the outstanding results in wearables, which comprises Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats, and was up over 60% year-over-year with growth accelerating from the March quarter.
IPhone revenue grew 20% year-over-year with iPhone ASP increasing to $724 from $606 a year ago driven by the strong performance of iPhone 10, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus across the world.During the quarter, we saw 41.3 million iPhones with double-digit unit growth in several markets including the US, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico, Hong Kong, Russia, the Middle East, and Africa.
We generated double-digit services growth in all of our geographic segments and the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Music, Cloud services, and Apple Pay, all set new June quarter records.Our Other Product category all set a new record for the June quarter with revenue of over 3.7 billion, that's up 37% from last year with great sales momentum for both Apple Watch and AirPods.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac.We were very happy to see double-digit year-over-year growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high with nearly 60% of purchases during the quarter coming from customers who are new to Mac. MPD indicates that iPad is a 60% share of the US tablet market in the June quarter up from 51% share a year ago.
We repurchased 20 billion worth of Apple shares, of which 10 billion related to the completion of our previous 210 billion buyback program and 10 billion to the beginning of the new 100 billion authorization we announced three months ago for a total of 112.8 million shares repurchased through open market transactions during the quarter.As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
And the App Store, Apple Care, Apple Music, Cloud services, Apple Pay, all set new June quarter records and of course subscriptions have now passed 300 million, as I had mentioned before.
So we feel pretty good about also the guidance for the fourth quarter.Looking forward, we don't provide guidance beyond the cutting quarter but I think you know we have a pretty good record over the last several years to make good business decisions balancing units, revenue, and margins.
And then I have a follow-up.Tim Cook ­-- Chief Executive OfficerShannon, we feel great about the results on iPhone, up 20%, and if you look for the cycle -- and by the cycle I mean Q1, Q2, and Q3, we've had on an average weekly basis growth and units of mid-single-digit and ASP growth of double-digit.
There is a fourth tariff which includes goods valued at 200 billion, also focused on goods that are imported from China -- that one is out for public comment, probably like everyone else we're evaluating that one and we'll be sharing our views of it with the administration and so forth before the comet period for that one is.It's actually a tedious process in going through it because you not only have to analyze the revenue products, which are a bit more straightforward to analyze, but you also have to analyze the purchases that you're making through other companies that are not related to revenue, maybe they're related to data centers and this sort of thing.
We're seeing the things that we have on the periphery of this like Apple TV units and revenue grew by very strong double-digits in Q3.
In terms of our installed base, which is something very important for us, as it is one of the key drivers of services, our active installed base on iPhone grew double-digits over last year during the quarter.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other incumbent expense, taxes, capital allocation, share repurchases, dividends, and future business outlook.Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.
Paid subscriptions from Apple and third parties have now surpassed 300 million, an increase of more than 60% in the past year alone.Revenue from subscriptions accounts for a significant and increasing percentage of our overall services business.
The app store turned ten years old this month and we set a new June quarter revenue record.
Our communication services are experiencing record usage.We've hit all-time highs for both the number of monthly active users of messages and the number of FaceTime calls made with growth accelerating from the March to June quarters.
Apple Pay continues to expand with well over 1 billion transactions last quarter, triple the amount from just a year ago with growth accelerating for the March quarter.To put that tremendous growth into perspective, this past quarter we completed more total transactions than great companies like Square and more mobile transactions than PayPal. Apple Pay is now live in 24 markets worldwide with over 4,900 bank partners and we look forward to adding Germany later this year.We're excited to share that in the US, eBay is beginning to enable its sellers to accept Apple Pay and CVS Pharmacy and 7-11 will roll out Apple Pay acceptance in locations nationwide this fall.
Developer and customer reaction has been very positive and we have over 4 million users participating in our new OS beta programs.Starting with iOS12, Siri will take a major step forward with Siri shortcuts, which deliver a new, much faster way to get things done and allow any app to work with Siri.
Apple Watch will become an even stronger companion for fitness, communication and quick access to information, with features including new workouts, activity sharing competitions, auto workout detection, advanced running features, walkie-talkie, podcast, and third-party apps on the Siri watch face.For Apple TV, we've seen major growth in sales since the introduction of Apple TV 4K last fall as video providers around the world choose Apple TV 4K to deliver their subscription services.
Later this year, charter communications will begin offering Apple TV 4K to its customers in nearly 50 million US households providing access to live channels and tens of thousands of on-demand programs via the Spectrum TV app on Apple TV 4K, iPhone, and iPad. And tvOS will take the cinematic experience of Apple TV 4K to the next level this fall with support for Dolby Atmos audio and new features to easily find popular shows and movies.
And among business buyers who plan to purchase iPhones in the September quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones up 3 points from the last survey.Turning to services, we had our best results ever with all-time record revenue of $9.5 billion.
Even with the difficult launch comparison, we saw great momentum in many emerging markets with growth well into double-digits and we established new June quarter records for Mac sales in India, Turkey, Chile, and Central and Eastern Europe.IPad unit sales grew from the fifth consecutive quarter and we gained significant share of the global tablet market based on the latest estimates from IDC.
Almost half of iPad purchases in the quarter were by customers new to IPad and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high.Our overall performance compared to last year was impacted by the introduction of new iPad Pro models in June of last year which resulted in both a different mix with higher ASPs in China fill a year ago.
And companies tell us that Mac has been instrumental in helping them attract and retain talent while providing strong security, streamlined deployment workflow, and significantly lower total cost of ownership.We're also seeing great interest in Business Chat, our powerful new way for organizations to connect with customers.
Business Chat lets customers get answers to questions, resolve issues, and complete transactions directly from within Messages by starting a conversation on their iPhone or IPad and even continue the conversation on their Mac or Apple Watch.
Apple's smartphone iPhone units have been relatively flat for four years and I think you've probably been a share gainer during the period, which would suggest at least at the high end the market that is perhaps flat to down.

apple,q4,2018,"With the recent addition of beautiful new stores in Italy, Japan, China and in just a few weeks Thailand, we will have 506 stores where we can further those relationships, almost half of which are outside the United States.Before I turn the call over to Luca, I'd like to touch on two items that may not show up in our financial statement but are just as integral to Apple's mission and our commitment to making the world a better place.
Luca?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tim. We are extremely pleased to report the record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic segments and established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter.Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year, with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific.
In fact, 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available on the App Store today and the largest of them all represents less than 0.3% of our total services revenue.Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. At over 100 million units, our active installed base of Mac is at an all-time high and the majority of customer purchasing Macs in the September quarter were new to Mac.We sold 9.7 million iPads during the quarter, gaining share in nearly every market we track, based on the latest estimates from IDC.
And among business customers, who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter, 74% plan to purchase iPads.Other Products revenue grew 31% to a new September quarter record, with an increase of over $1 billion compared to a year ago.
Thanks to wearables growth of over 50% and the strong performance of Apple TV, in addition to the introduction of HomePod earlier this year.As we look back across fiscal 2018, we have made great progress in the enterprise market where iOS is transforming our business gets done across multiple industries.
And we returned a total of almost $90 billion to our investors during the year, including almost $14 billion in dividends and equivalents and over $73 billion in share repurchases.Before we discuss our December quarter outlook, I'd like to describe a number of changes in our financial reporting that we are implementing as we enter our new fiscal year.
First, given the increased importance of our Services business and in order to provide additional transparency to our financial results, we will start reporting revenue as well as cost of sales for both total products and total services beginning this December quarter.
Third, starting the December quarter, we will no longer be providing unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and Mac.As we have stated many times, our objective is to make great products and services that enrich people's lives and to provide an unparalleled customer experience so that our users are highly satisfied, loyal, and engaged.
As we accomplish these objectives, strong financial results follow.As demonstrated by our financial performance in recent years, the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business.
So can you talk about how you see the trajectory there for the business and what you think of the initiatives of some companies like Netflix and Fortnite trying to bypass the App Store around subscriptions and I have a follow up.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerSure.
And when we look at the impact of foreign exchange on our revenue for the December quarter, we are looking at 200 basis points of headwinds, which translates given our, the size of our business to almost $2 billion of headwind to our revenue.The third point that I think it's important to keep in mind, and Tim has talked about this, we are launching -- in the last six weeks we've launched an unprecedented number of new products.
When you look at our financial performance in recent years, take the last three years for example, the number of units sold during any quarter has not been necessarily preventative of the underlying strength of our business,if you look at our revenue during the last three years, if you look at our net income during the last three years, if you look at our stock price in the last three years, there is no correlation to the units sold in any given period.As you know very well, in addition, our product ranges for all the major product categories become wider over time, and therefore a unit of sale is less relevant for us at this point compared to the past, because we got this much wider sales price dispersion.
But of course, we understand that this is something of interest and when we believe that providing qualitative commentary on unit sales offers additional relevant information to investors, we will do so.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerLet me make one additional point there, just for clarity, is that, Shannon, our intention is to continue to give revenue guidance at the company level and gross margin guidance in the other categories that we've been providing.
Thanks.Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerMike, as we said, during the September quarter we set new records for many, many services categories right from Apple Music to Cloud Services, to the App Store to AppleCare and Apple Pay really has an exponential trajectory right now.When we look at our services business, we think about the fact that we had a very large and growing installed base.
In terms of reporting results, one of the things that we're doing and it's new and it's an addition to the information that we provide to investors because we've heard some significant level of interest around this is starting with the December quarter for the first time, we are going to be providing information on revenue and cost of sales and therefore gross margins for both products and services.
And this will be the first time that we're going to provide gross margin information for our Services business which we believe it is an important metric for our investors to follow.I've given that the rationale and why we do not believe that providing unit sales is particularly relevant for our company at this point.
Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record, fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and 10 and the very successful launch of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever, with the industry's first 7 nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple design 8-core neural engine capable of executing an astounding five trillion operations per second.
And 10 months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest rated mobile peer-to-peer service by consumer reports, based on exceptional payment authentication and data privacy.We set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue.
The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4 has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by it's all new design, larger display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced cellular reception and electrical heart sensor.Later this year, the ECG app will be available to Apple Watch Series 4 customers in the US, giving them the ability to take an electric cardiogram anytime, right from their wrist.
This is a great example of how our commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive one's unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems and beautiful solutions that set us apart.I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018.
We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS and cash flow from operations.
As Tim mentioned, we reached new all-time quarterly revenue record for many services categories and we are well on our way to achieve our goal to double our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020.We now have over 330 million paid subscriptions on our platform, an increase of over 50% versus a year ago.
We saw great response to our new MacBook Pro models that we launched in July with strong double-digit revenue growth, driving an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue.
The companies will also provide tools and resources for millions of Salesforce developers to build their own native apps with the new Salesforce mobile SDK for iOS.And finally, we recently announced Apple Business Manager, a new way for IT teams to deploy Apple devices at scale.
We repurchased 92.5 million Apple shares for $19.4 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents.For our fiscal year 2018, revenue grew over $36 billion to $265.6 billion, an all-time record.
We also set new all-time records for net income up 23% versus last year and EPS up 29%.
Why aren't we seeing that flows through to margin expansion for the overall company?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYou are referring to the guidance that we provided for Q1, I imagine and --Kathryn Huberty -- Morgan Stanley & Co.

apple,q1,2019,"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook.
Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form Form 10-Q and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release.
We noted four factors that would impact our results when we provided guidance in November: different iPhone launch timing from a year ago, FX headwinds, supply constraints on certain products, and macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets.
So, I wanna share a bit more detail on the positives we see in China.We generated record December quarter services revenue in Greater China fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over two and a half million registered iOS developers.
We also continued to grow our total active installed base by adding new customers.
As a result, we estimate that less than half of iPhones sold in Japan in 1 of this year were subsidized compared to about three quarters a year ago and that the total value of those subsidies have come down as well.
And I'm very proud to say that nearly 16 years after launching the iTunes store, we generated our highest quarterly music revenue ever thanks to the great popularity of Apple Music now with over 50 million paid subscribers.
iPad revenue was up 17%, its highest growth rate in almost six years, powered by the new iPad Pro, released in November.
We also had our best quarter ever for wearables, home, and accessories with 33% growth in total and almost 50% growth from wearables thanks to strong sales above Apple Watch and AirPods.We don't measure our success in 90-day increments.
It's humbling to read emails from customers around the world telling us how Apple Watch has dramatically changed their lives by motivating them to be more fit and active, by alerting them to potentially serious health conditions, such as AFib, and by helping them in times of crisis with features like fall detection and emergency SOS.We believe we are just beginning to see the impact we can make to improving health and are deeply inspired by the possibilities.
On a sequential basis, product gross margin increased 60 basis points due to positive leverage from the holiday quarter partially offset by higher cost structures as we launched several new products and by headwinds from foreign exchange.
Services gross margin also increased 170 basis points, sequentially due to favorable mix and leverage, partially offset by foreign exchange.
On a geographic basis, most of the decline from last year came from Greater China and other emerging markets with difficult macro and foreign exchange conditions affected our results.
Many services categories set new all-time revenue records all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts growing by strong double-digits over last year.
We also had great results for iPad with revenue up 17% from a year ago and strong performance of both iPad and iPad Pro and generated double-digit growth in four of our five geographic segments.
And I'm wondering if you can comment about whether that's conservatism, whether you're entering the quarter with a high level of channel inventory -- and maybe you can comment explicitly on that -- or whether you actually think the macroeconomic conditions are getting worse.Luca Maestri -- Apple, Inc.
And maybe to that end, maybe you can help us understand what iPhones' average replacement cycle might be today, and how that may have changed over the last three to five years.
And so, depending on how these separate businesses do in the marketplace, we're gonna be seeing some level of movement going forward on services margins.But you've seen that for the last 12 months, they've gone up nicely 450 basis points.
And it's a wonderful customer experience.We've added Apple Music where we now have more than 50 million paid subscribers and continues to grow very nicely.
As you know, our December quarter revenue was below our original expectations, coming in at $84.3 billion.
Our revenue there was down by $4.8 billion from last year with declines across iPhone, Mac, and iPad. Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than we anticipated, our business grew outside of China, including new records in the Americas, western Europe, central and eastern Europe, and our rest of Asia-Pacific segment.
In fact, more than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during the December quarter were purchasing that product for the first time.
What's very important, however, is that in spite of these factors, our total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3 billion at the end of January of 2018 to 1.4 billion by the end of December reaching a new all-time high for each of the many product categories and for all five of our geographic segments.Not only is our large and growing install base a powerful testament to the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling our fast-growing services business.
In fact, services revenue set an all-time record of $10.9 billion in the December quarter, growing 19%.
We launched Apple Pay in three new countries in the December quarter: Germany, Belgium, and Kazakhstan.
Revenue from cloud services continues to grow rapidly with year-over-year revenue up over 40% in the December quarter.
The largest category represents less than 30% of total services revenue.And the new services we've launched in the last few years are all experiencing tremendous growth.
-- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tim. As Tim said, revenue for the December quarter was $84.3 billion.
Looking at proto categories, iPhone revenue declined 15% from a year ago where revenue from the rest of our business grew 19% to an all-time record, including our best results ever for services, for wearables, and for Mac. This quarter, for the first time, we're making an important new disclosure to our investors as we believe it will foster a better understanding of our business.We are now reporting on a quarterly basis gross margin for products in aggregate and for services in aggregate.
However, our global acting install base of iPhones continues to grow and has reached an all-time high at the end of December.
Turning to services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue of $10.9 billion, up 19% year-over-year with new December quarter records in all five of our geographic segments.
And it excludes the impact of the revenue reclassification between products and services we recorded in connection with ASC 606, the new revenue recognition accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal '19.
The number of transacting accounts on our digital stores reached a new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts growing by strong double-digits over last year.
And half of all the customers purchasing Macs in the December quarter were new to Mac. Similar to the Mac, our install base of iPads reached a new all-time high.And among customers purchasing iPads during the quarter, half were new to iPad. Revenue from this category was up over $1.8 billion compared to a year ago thanks to the amazing popularity of Apple Watch and AirPods, both of which were supply constrained as we exited the quarter.
Our retail and online stores generated strong results from Mac and iPad and all-time record performance from services and from wearables.Following the launch of the new iPhone trade-in campaign, our stores more than doubled the volume of iPhones traded in compared to last year, reaching an all-time high in Q1.
The second factor for the growth of the services business is that within this installed base, the percentage of users who are paying for at least one service is growing very strongly.
During the last few years, as you know, we've launched Apple Music, Apple Pay, an advertising service for our developers on the app store.
We're also looking to launch new services going forward that we believe will provide great value to our users.
I think an important point I need to make -- and I think it's helpful that you asked the question -- is that a portion of this deceleration is truly just a reclassification of the amortization of free services that we've made in connection with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
And by the way, when we report our March quarter results, we will also talk about the next step in our category return program which is something that we do traditionally in the spring.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Katie.
-- Chief Financial OfficerWell, Steve, we did mention on the call last quarter that the different timing our phone launches would affect the year-over-year compares.
I think you've seen that services gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by a significant amount.
Some of them tend to be accretive to the average gross margin for services, also because of the way we account for them -- for example, you know that on the app store, we book revenue on a net basis.
And then my second question is just when you think about growth in services, you have selling more to existing paid subscription customers or it's the 300 going to a half a billion.
",45.43,0.338919
apple,q2,2019,"I'll talk more about these categories later.While we grew year-over-year and developed markets and while we had record March quarter results in a number of major markets, including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Japan, we did experience a revenue decline in emerging markets.
Our year-over-year revenue performance in Greater China improved relative to the December quarter and we've seen very positive customer response to the pricing actions we've taken in that market, our trading and financing programs in our retail stores, the effects of government measures to stimulate the economy and improved trade dialog between the United States and China.
In fact, we had our best quarter ever for the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services and our App Store search ad business and we set new March quarter revenue records for AppleCare and Apple Pay. Apple Pay is now available in 30 markets and we expect to be live in 40 markets by the end of the year.
Everyone here is hard at work to prepare for WWDC and it's always a privilege to get to share the future of our platforms with the community of world-changing developers who bring it to live; you are not going to want to miss this one.We are in the fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business and it does confidently in our future.
For more details on that and our March quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tim. Revenue in the March quarter was $58 billion, near the high end of the guidance range that we provided 90 days ago, and down 5% from last year.
We're seeing positive customer response to recent pricing actions in certain emerging markets, as well as enhancements to our trade-in and financing programs and our year-over-year performance improved relative to our December quarter results in Greater China, in the Americas and in Japan.
And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones.Turning to Services, as Tim said, it was our best quarter ever with $11.5 billion in revenue, an increase of 16% from last year.
And across all third-party subscription apps, the largest accounted for only 0.3% of our total Services revenue.Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. On a global basis, nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac. And the active installed base of Macs reached a new all-time high.We had great results for iPad, reached $4.9 billion in revenue and growth accelerating from the December quarter to 22%.
We expect OI&E to be about $250 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%.Also reflecting the approved increase, today our Board of Directors has declared the cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock payable on May 16, 2019, to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2019.With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.Questions and Answers:Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Luca.
How much of that incremental is going in to support the new services that you're planning to launch later in the year?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes. Of course, we are supporting both our products and services business, and you can see the trajectory of our OpEx over the different quarters.
So it's a very important business for us in many ways, for our ecosystem and for our ability to monetize it and so clearly we will make all the necessary investments to ensure that the new services are successful and we're really encouraged by the level of customer response that we've received so far in anticipation for the launch of these services.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director of Investor RelationsThank you, Samik.
It does from a customer user point of view, the trade-in looks like a subsidy, and so it is a way to offset the device cost itself and many people and literally every market that we've tried this in, there is a a reasonable number of people that want to take and pay for something on installments instead of all at once.
I think the key is, we're trying to build something into the consumer mindset that it's good for the environment and good for them to trade-in their current device on a new device and we do our best to getting the current device to someone else that can use that or in some cases, if the product is at an end of life, we are recycling the parts on it to make sure that it can carry on in another form.Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystThanks for the color, Tim. As part of this, we have agreed that we're not going to share the financial terms of the agreements, so we plan to honor that.
And then I have a follow?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. I wouldn't want to get into announcing things in the call, but obviously we're always working on new things.
Thank you.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerI think India is a very important market in the long-term.
After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook.
Thanks to our robust ecosystem, our talented developer community and the country's growing population of tech savvy consumers who value the very best products and services.For iPhone, while our worldwide revenue was down 17% from a year ago, declines were significantly smaller in the final weeks of the March quarter.
Importantly, our active installed base of devices continues to grow in each of our geographic segments and set a new all-time record for all major product categories.
And Ticketmaster has just announced that they will be accepting Apple Pay for ticket purchases on the web and through the Ticketmaster app and over 50 of their entertainment and sporting venues are launching contactless tickets this year, including the vast majority of NFL stadiums.Subscriptions are powerful driver of our Services business.
The app stores is already the world's biggest gaming platform and we think Apple Arcade is a great way to unleash the creativity of the game developer community with the collection of new games, not available on any other mobile platform or in any other subscription service.
But we believe that our Mac revenue would have been up compared to last year without those constraints and don't believe this challenge will have a significant impact on our Q3 results.For iPad, we were very happy to return to growth in Greater China, while generating strong double-digit growth in each of our other geographic segments.
Our great iPad results were driven primarily by strong customer response to iPad Pro. Late in the quarter, we launched in all new iPad Air with an ultra-thin design, Apple Pencil support and high-end performance powered by Apple's A12 Bionic chip.
In addition, we introduced a new iPad Mini, a major upgrade for iPad fans who love an ultra-portable design and like the new iPad Air it delivers the power of the A12 Bionic and support for Apple Pencil.Last month, we introduced new AirPods, the second generation of the world's most popular wireless headphones and demand has been incredible.
Overall products revenue declined 9% driven primarily by iPhone, while Services revenue grew 16% to a new all-time record.
Among customers who plan to purchase tablets, 77% of consumers and 75% of businesses plan to purchase iPads.Wearables, home and accessories revenue set a new March quarter revenue record of $5.1 billion, fueled primarily by the strong performance of our wearables business, which grew close to 50%.
Interest in AirPods has been off the charts and we're working hard to catch up with incredible customer demand.Turning to our retail and online stores, we generated very strong double-digit revenue growth from Apple Watch and iPad. We also announced 50 new Today at Apple sessions during the quarter in three new and expanded formats; Skills, Walks and Labs, free at our stores around the world.
Apple services are also making their way on board including growing adoption of Apple Pay for food and beverage purchases and in-flight access to Apple Music.We're also seeing significant iOS traction with large enterprise platforms, which are the face of complex backend systems to tens of millions of employees around the world.
Can we have the next question please?OperatorThe next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan -- AnalystHi. Do any of those learnings kind of carried through into how you decide pricing in the remaining emerging markets, like India, et cetera, as you get ready for the next product cycle?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerWe have made some adjustments in India, and we've seen preliminarily some better results there.
So can you just talk about which regions or product segment you think can outperform that typical seasonality?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes, Katy, and keep in mind, by the way, we are reporting this guidance including a 300 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange.

When you step back and consider wearables and services together, two areas where we have strategically invested in the last several years, they now approach the size of a Fortune 50 company.Geographically, we are happy with our performance across the board including, a return to growth in Mainland China.
Our active, installed base of iPhone reached a new all-time high and was up year-over-year in each of our top 20 markets, underscoring the quality of our products and the satisfaction and loyalty of iPhone customers around the world.Revenue excluding iPhone was up 17% from last year with growth across all categories.
Starting with services, we generated all-time record revenue of $11.5 billion, that's up 13% year-over-year and if we exclude the $236 million favorable one-time item from the June quarter last year, services growth was 15%, or 18% in constant currency, which is consistent with our Q2 performance.Our strong services performance was broad-based.
We surpassed 420 million paid subscriptions to services across our platform, and we remain on track to double our fiscal year 16 Services revenue in 2020.In May, we launched our all-new Apple TV app in over 100 countries, bringing together all the ways to watch TV in a single app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and select smart TVs. Monthly viewers in the Apple TV app in the United States are up over 40% year-over-year.
We had great results for Apple Watch, which set a new June quarter revenue record and is reaching millions of new users.
We continue to see phenomenal demand for AirPods, and when you tally up the last four quarters, our Wearables business is now bigger than 60% of the companies in the Fortune 500.We had great performance from iPad with revenue of over $5 billion and growth driven by iPad Pro, and by strong customer response to the new iPad mini and iPad Air. This was our third consecutive quarter of growth and with revenue up 15% year-to-date, we feel great about where we're headed with iPad. With our current lineup of iPad, iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro, we've got the perfect device for everyone from young learners to professionals.We were also very happy with double-digit revenue growth from Mac, fueled by a strong performance of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Looking forward, there is an enormous amount to be excited about for Mac. On the heels of our Mac Mini and iMac updates earlier in the fiscal year, we brought significant updates to the bulk of our notebook line up in the last couple of months.
Our developers are already running with these new technologies and we think our customers are going to love some of the apps these creators have in store in the months ahead.On so many fronts, there is an enormous amount to look forward to over the next few months, including the launch of new services, like Apple Arcade, Apple TV Plus, and Apple Card.
Product categories outside of iPhone grew 20%, with strong results in wearables, Mac, and iPad. Services revenue grew 13% to a new all-time record of $11.5 billion.
Excluding the one-time item we highlighted a year ago in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits, services revenue growth was 16%, and 18% in constant currency terms.On a geographic basis, we saw a marked improvement in our year-over-year comparisons from emerging markets relative to the first half of this fiscal year, particularly in the BRIC countries where year-over-year performance went from a 25% revenue decline in the first half to 3% growth in the June quarter.
In emerging markets, we returned to growth in Mainland China, grew strong double digits in India and in Brazil, and we set new Q3 records in Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.Company gross margin was 37.6%, flat sequentially, and in line with our guidance.
This was significantly better year-over-year performance than last quarter, 17% decline with sequential improvement in year-over-year comparisons in 15 of our top 20 markets.Our active installed base of iPhone continued to grow to a new all-time high in each of our geographic segments, and in the US, the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and XS Max combined.
Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 83% plan to purchase iPhones.Turning to services, we reached an all-time revenue record in spite of foreign exchange headwinds with double-digit growth from the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, and AppleCare, and triple-digit growth from Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business.
All geographic segments had double-digit growth in services revenue and set new June quarter records, with all-time records in the Americas and rest of Asia Pacific.
The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high in the June quarter, and the number of paid accounts grew strong double digits compared to last year.
Mac revenue grew in four of our five geographic segments, and set June quarter records in the US, Europe, and Japan, as our overall market performance significantly outpace the global PC industry.
Nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, with revenue growing in both developed and emerging markets and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all-time high.We also had great results for iPad with $5 billion in revenue, up 8%.
In addition, we generated double-digit revenue growth from Apple TV and Accessories during the quarter.Our retail and online stores produced our best June quarter revenue ever with double-digit revenue growth across Apple Watch, iPad, Mac and Accessories our trade-in program is showing great momentum with more than five times the number of iPhones traded in compared to a year ago.
We took some pricing action, we instituted our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores and worked with certain channel partners on that as well, and we are seeing a growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem during the quarter.And so when you look at it, each of our categories -- iPhone , iPad, Mac, wearables, services -- everything improved sequentially.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook.
Based on June quarter performance, Apple Pay is now adding more new users than PayPal, and monthly transaction volume is growing four times as fast.
For iPhone users, iOS 13 will take on a dramatic new look with dark mode, while delivering major updates to the apps you use every day including photos, camera, and maps.
iOS 13 offers great new ways to help you manage your privacy and security, including sign-on with Apple, which uses Face ID or Touch ID to quickly sign into apps and websites without sharing your personal information.
And improvements across the entire system will make iPhone even faster and more delightful to use than ever before.For the first time, iPad is getting its own version of iOS called iPadOS, a strategic step forward that takes the iPad experience to a whole new level.
The redesigned home screen, powerful new multitasking tools, and deeper integration with Apple Pencil take productivity and creativity further, including using your iPad as an extended an interactive second monitor for your Mac. For Apple TV, TvOS 13 will make the big screen experience even more personal.
WatchOS 6 includes powerful new features like notifications that warned about high-decibel noise to protect your hearing, and cycle tracking to aid in women's healthcare decisions.In the June quarter, we expanded the availability of the ECG app and irregular rhythm notifications to five additional European countries, and added Canada and Singapore just last week, making them available in 31 countries and regions around the world with more to come later this year.
A new tool included in Mac OS Catalina called Mac Catalyst gives developers a major head start in bringing their iOS apps to the Mac. And while providing these things, we've created a dynamic environment where a developer benefits benefit greatly from creating for, and distributing on these platforms.
In addition to our retail stores, that are over 1,800 third-party Apple Authorized Service Providers in the US, which is three times as many locations as three years ago.Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the June quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high.The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 94% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPads.
In the financial services industry, 90 of the largest 100 banks by asset size are deploying Apple products to improve efficiency and effectiveness across their organizations.iPhone and iPad are overwhelmingly the preferred mobile devices for bankers on the go.
Or do you think at some point down the road, those services will be independent by itself not really tied to your hardware installed base?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerWell, there are elements today that are not necessarily tethered to iPhone, right?
I don't want to go into the specific numbers, but I think you can see readily mathematically how the installed base is growing in an environment where the iPhone revenue is declining within a 90-day kind of window.Luca Maestri -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd, Jim, on OpEx. What level of interest have you seen from developers and how are they thinking about the ability to monetize services independently on those App Stores?

The significant upswing in demand in the final part of the quarter is mirrored in the overwhelmingly positive reviews, customer feedback and in-store response we've seen for this new generation of devices, not to mention a wave of the best photos you've seen from a smartphone.iPhone 11 features the Apple-designed A13 Bionic the fastest most powerful chip ever in a smartphone plus an all new dual camera system and even longer all day battery life all wrapped in six great new colors.
They also produce the highest quality video in a smartphone supporting 4K video with extended dynamic range for more highlight detail and cinematic video stabilization.iOS 13 is driving user experience forward across the iPhone family with a bold new look in dark mode, major updates to the apps our customers use every day, such as photos and maps, new ways to help protect their privacy with sign-in with Apple and performance improvements across the entire system.For Services, revenue was $12.5 billion, that's up 18% over last year and it beats the previous record set in the June quarter by more than $1 billion.
We think these features appeal broadly to all iPhone customers, and we believe this has been the most successful launch of a credit card in United States ever.Last month, we launched Apple Arcade, our groundbreaking game subscription service offering an all new way for the whole family to enjoy games online or offline.
We introduce new services from Apple Card to Apple TV+ and generated over $46 billion in total services revenue, setting new yearly services records in all five of our geographic segments and driving our Services business to the size of a Fortune 70 company.We delivered incredible new hardware in all our device categories.
Products revenue was $51.5 billion, down 1% from last year, mainly due to iPhone, but largely offset by very strong performance from Wearables and iPad. Services revenue grew 18% to $12.5 billion, up over $1.9 billion year-over-year and almost $1.1 billion sequentially to a new all-time record with broad-based growth around the world and across our portfolio.On a geographic basis, we set new fourth quarter revenue records in our Americas and Rest of Asia Pacific segments.
We also saw continuous improvement in Greater China where year-over-year revenue comparisons became more favorable each quarter of fiscal 2019 from a 27% decline in the first quarter to a 2% decline in the fourth quarter.At a country level, we established new Q4 records in many major developed and emerging markets including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Korea, Singapore, Brazil, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.Company gross margin was 38%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue.
In total, services accounted for 20% of our revenue mix and 33% of our gross margin mix.Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with double-digit growth in paid accounts in all our geographic segments.
The new program complements our continued investment in our growing global network of over 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers the lead the industry for customer satisfaction and help millions of people with both in and out-of-warranty service for all Apple products.Next I would like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $7 billion, down 5% from last year due to a different mix of products, given the strength of our MacBook Air lineup and a difficult comparison to last year's launch of MacBook Pro models.
And among both consumers and businesses who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter more than 80% plan to purchase iPads.Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new fourth quarter record with revenue of $6.5 billion, up 54% year-over-year with growth accelerating from the third quarter across all five geographic segments.
And as Tim mentioned, we set Q4 records for our Wearables category in every single market we track around the world.Our retail and online stores produced fantastic results, generating record September quarter revenue in all five geographic segments, and strong double-digit growth across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and accessories.
This iconic store is opened seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and provides an even better environment for customers to experience our latest products, meet with our geniuses, creative pros and specialists, and attend our free daily Today at Apple sessions.We also opened our newest and largest store in Japan, and fifth store in Tokyo, in the Marunouchi business district across from the historic Tokyo Station, and we opened a beautiful new store in the heart of Mexico City's vibrant Polanco district to welcome visitors to experience the best of Apple in Mexico.We are seeing strong demand for our products in the enterprise market, with growth significantly ahead of our business overall, and we have great momentum transforming major industries.
Hundreds of thousands of Apple devices will be deployed this fiscal year to support an innovative new model for the collection and management of Census data and we are proud that our products will play an important role in driving quality to this critical initiative while safeguarding the privacy and security of this data.CDW Apple's partner in this initiative will also utilize Apple Financial Services, our enterprise financing platform to help minimize the cost to the public by taking advantage of the uniquely strong residual value of Apple devices.Let me now turn to our cash position.
So can you just talk about the gives and takes that land you at the December quarter gross margin guidance?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYes. On the other side, foreign exchange for us continues to be probably the biggest headwind that we've got right now is going to be negative 70 basis points on a sequential basis.
And for our pro customers who push the limits of what Mac can do, we're very excited about the upcoming launch of our newly redesigned Mac Pro this fall, which we are proud to be manufacturing in Austin, Texas.Pulling back the lens from a single quarter, we are incredibly proud of our accomplishments over the course of a remarkable fiscal 2019, a year where we crossed $100 billion in revenue in the United States for the first time.
We continue to put user privacy at the center of everything that we do and we know that Apple is strongest when our commitment to diversity and inclusion brings all voices to the table.I'd like to thank our customers, our developers, our business partners and our employees for making fiscal 2019 such a success, and I look forward to another great year in 2020.Now for more details on our September quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone.Revenue for the quarter was $64 billion, up 2% from a year ago to a new September quarter record as we had predicted foreign exchange negatively impacted our revenue by close to $1 billion, and in constant currency, our growth was 3%.
More than half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all-time high.We had great results for iPad with revenue of $4.7 billion, up 17% from a year ago.
In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the September quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high.
And if you think that's something that's realistic to expect in fiscal '20?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerKaty, it's Tim. We are very thrilled with what we're seeing in early going on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. We've put our current thinking in the guidance and you can tell from the guidance we are bullish.Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGreat.
I'm sure, I agree with Luca, you've been very instrumental over the years.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director, Investor RelationsThank you.Shannon Cross -- Cross Research -- AnalystMy questions though with regard to China, and I don't know, Tim, if you can talk more about what you're seeing in China, the trends during the quarter, the reception specifically there to the iPhone, any thoughts on -- you know, Hong Kong used to be a big market, there is obviously some turmoil there.
Thank you.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, we had a very good September, Shannon, and the lead of that is sort of the reception of iPhone 11 and 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, and so we feel really good about how we've gotten started there.
And when we do that we need to make the adequate investments in marketing and advertising to raise the awareness of the new products and new services and that is what you're seeing for example in the guidance that we provided for the first quarter as we're launching new services right now, and so we're making investments both in engineering and in advertising to support the new launches.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director, Investor RelationsThank you, Shannon.
So we'll see how it goes, but we take into account all these different factors.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerOn the bundle question, Toni, we look at each service, and decide what's best to do for it and with TV+, we concluded that a great way to get more people to see the content would be to do this, and it would be a good gift for our users.
That's a part of what we announced with the Apple Card earlier in the call and so we are cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of standard kind of basis and we are committed to make that easier to do than perhaps it is today.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director, Investor RelationsThank you, Toni.
I do think the upgrade market will get larger over time, but just don't have a current view as to how often and so forth.On the AirPods, we're anxious to see the customers for the new AirPods Pro, but I would guess that one particularly in the early going will be people that have AirPods today and want to have -- also have a pair for the times that they need noise-cancellation.Nancy Paxton -- Senior Director, Investor RelationsThank you, Samik.

apple,q1,2020,"After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook.
Our record performance was fueled by iPhone where December quarter revenue was up 8% year-over-year and by our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth outside of iPhone, including a new all-time record for Services and another blowout quarter for Wearables.Our active installed base of devices has now surpassed 1.5 billion, up over 100 million in the last 12 months alone reaching a new all-time high for each of our main product categories and geographic segments.
We continue to focus on telling stories that matter like Little America, which recently premiered to widespread critical acclaim with much more great content still to come.Apple News now draws over 100 million monthly active users in the US, UK, Australia and Canada and provides a curated and personalized experience using on-device intelligence to recommend stories.
And the high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty for both products drove the active installed base of both Mac and iPad to new records in all geographic segments.
With our current lineup of iPad Pro, iPad Air iPad mini and iPad, along with the new iPad OS, we give our customers an unparalleled tablet experience integrated -- integrating hardware, software and services in a way that only Apple can.This was also a very exciting quarter for the Mac as we launched our most powerful notebook ever.
Thanks in part to a doubling in iPhone trade-ins versus last year, our retail and online stores set an all-time record and delivered strong double-digit growth in iPhone.
Today, millions of students in more than 5,000 schools worldwide use Everyone Can Code curriculum to bring their ideas to life and develop important skills, including creativity, collaboration and problem solving.November also saw the launch of our new Research app, the latest in our ongoing effort to put the future of health in the hands of every user.
Services revenue grew 17% to a new all-time record $12.7 billion, with double-digit growth in every geographic segment, a new all-time record across our portfolio.Company gross margin was 38.4%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue in spite of a negative 60 basis point impact from foreign exchange.
We've actually already reached that goal on a run rate basis with the results of the December quarter.Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double-digits in all of our geographic segments.
Given the tremendous momentum we are experiencing across our services offerings, we are increasing our target for paid subscriptions and aim to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020.App Store revenue grew strong double-digits.
Apple Music set an all-time revenue record offering a catalog of over 60 million songs to our customers.
iCloud also generated an all-time revenue record growing very strong double-digits, while offering our customers a safe, secure and seamless experience across all their devices.
And among both consumers and businesses were planning to purchase tablets in the March quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPads.Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new all-time record with revenue of $10 billion, up 37% year-over-year with very strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments and growth across wearables, accessories and home.
How much of the growth you think is coming from first-time buyers of AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have because it looks to us adoption rates are fairly low in your installed base, so that there should be a long runway, but love to just understand how you see the growth divide up between those two buckets?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah.
We're seeing that with Little America and others.Tom Forte -- D.A. And then my second question is, I think you indicated that last month, you started offering consumers the ability to use a Apple Card to buy an iPhone on an installment basis.
Can you talk about how that's had an impact on your unit sales for iPhones?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerSo retail stores did fantastic on iPhone, very strong double-digit growth in iPhone from a year-over-year point of view.
Once again, we saw double-digit growth in all five of our geographic segments and established new all-time records for multiple categories, including cloud services, music, payment services and our App Store search ad business, as well as setting a December quarter record for the App Store and Apple Care.
Apple Watch had a great start to fiscal 2020, setting an all-time revenue record during the quarter.
We are working closely with our Apple team members and partners in the affected areas, and our thoughts are with all of those affected across the region.As we close the books on a record-breaking December quarter, we are already well under way on some new and exciting developments for the future.
Apple strength will always be its boundless creativity and innovation, and this year will be no different.But for now for more details on the results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tim. Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional as we set new all-time records for revenue, net income and earnings per share.
Products revenue was $79.1 billion, up 8% as iPhone return to growth, and we have incredibly strong results in Wearables where we set all-time records for both Apple Watch and AirPods.
As Tim mentioned, we established new all-time records for Apple Music, cloud services, payment services and our App Store search ad business and December quarter records for the App Store and Apple Care.
But we expect that, that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and cost savings.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Amit.
And so, it was an important part of it.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Tom. Tim, can you talk about what you're seeing in the region -- what you were seeing in the region prior to the health crisis.
Thank you.Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYes, as I said earlier to the question around the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, we are seeing a benign commodity environment.
And so, we will continue that practice as we go through the year.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Shannon.
And so while these services did not have a material impact in our December quarter results, we expect that over time these are contributing to the growth of the Services business, but we feel very happy with the 17%.Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystThank you for that.
The amount of revenue that we recognized during the quarter was immaterial to our results.With regard to the cost of the service, of developing the content, we -- essentially, as we incur this cost, we put them on the balance sheet and then we amortize them over a certain period of time depending on the type of content that we produce.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThanks, Wamsi.
Kind of curious how much of that is part of it is driven by some of your Intel modem asset purchases or TV+ in the opex or how do we think about it on a go-forward basis?Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I think we felt good about our opex results because they were at the low end of our guidance range, but clearly, we want to make all the necessary investments in the business and from -- in terms of the new services, not only for TV+, but all the new services that we launched during 2019, this is a period where we're making the necessary investments in advertising and marketing and that level of investment is reflected in our opex results.
There are already companies that are deep into the enterprise business that are working on applications for the enterprise and of course, you can see -- you can go on the store and see thousands of apps that are AR Kit-enabled at this time and with even more coming.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Mike.
Our net income, for example, was up 11% during the December quarter.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you.
And we feel we have a very good momentum.Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Samik.

apple,q2,2020,"While our product teams were preparing to launch a new iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, MacBook Air and the new iPhone SE, all of which have been very well received by reviewers and consumers alike, they were also working with our suppliers to design, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5 million face shields, and we continue to ship more than 1 million of these every week to the doctors, nurses and medical personnel on the frontlines.In a quarter, where our Services teams achieved strong growth, which Luca will dig into in a minute and which speaks to the real durability of our services strategy, these teams were also putting COVID-19 front and center.
Based on Apple's performance during the first five weeks of the quarter, we were confident we were headed toward a record second quarter at the very high end of our expectations.In the next five weeks of the quarter, as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, as well as demand for our products within China.
During the last three weeks of the quarter, as the virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including the closure of all our retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13 and many channel partner points of sales around the world, we saw a downward pressure on demand particularly for iPhone and Wearables.
Apple will continue to do everything we can do to help the global response and to keep our customers learning, creating, sharing and connecting so that live can remain as normal as it can during this challenging time.With that, I'll hand things off to Luca.Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone.It has been a very different quarter than we were expecting when we last talked to you at the end of January, but we could not be more proud of our Apple teams around the world, our role in supporting local communities and our partners throughout the value chain, and how resilient our business and financial performance has been during these challenging times.So the revenue for the quarter was $58.3 billion, up 1% from a year ago, despite the extreme circumstances from the impact of COVID-19 and a headwind of 100 basis points from foreign exchange.
After a very strong January, our performance was impacted, particularly during the last three weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures increased due to COVID-19 spreading around the world and affected our product sales.
Our operations team and manufacturing partners put forth an extraordinary effort to restore production quickly, and we exited the quarter in a good supply position for most of our product lines.On the demand side, after a very strong first five weeks, we saw the impact of COVID-19 affect demand in China for the next five weeks and then more broadly around the world for the last three weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures became more widespread in many countries.
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow strongly, and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter.
For example, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach as over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch around the world during the quarter, were new to the product.Next, I'd like to talk about Mac and iPad. Towards the end of the quarter, we launched a brand-new iPad Pro that includes a first-in-class LiDAR scanner with some really exciting augmented reality applications, and MacBook Air, with significantly improved performance at a lower price.
We returned $22 billion to shareholders during the March quarter, including $18.5 billion through open market repurchases of 64.7 million Apple shares and $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents.Finally, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call.
However, based on what we have seen in April and how we think things might play out, I would like to provide some additional insight on headwinds and tailwinds we're facing.From a foreign exchange standpoint, the US dollar has appreciated recently against most currencies around the world, and as a result, we expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by more than $1.5 billion on a year-over-year basis.
First, customers are actively engaging with our ecosystem and digital services, and we believe the very strong recent performance in the App Store, video, Music and cloud services will continue throughout the June quarter.
We will continue to stay focused on what we do best, investing in our product and service pipeline, managing the business wisely and taking care of our teams, and believe we will come out from this stronger.With that, let's open the call to questions.Tejas Gala -- Senior Manager, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Luca.
We think by looking at it, a part of it is due to just our new products, a part of it is due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April, and then a part of it is probably the consumer behavior of knowing this is going to go on for a little while longer and getting some devices and so forth lined up to work at home more.In particular for, as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year-over-year basis during this quarter.
And obviously, we want to develop that technology because we consider it's a core technology for us.And so we will try to balance the need to continue to invest during difficult circumstances and the fact that we like to manage the business wisely.Tejas Gala -- Senior Manager, Corporate Finance and Investor RelationsThank you, Shannon.
They are even more important in these times.Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America -- AnalystThank you, Tim. As a follow-up, I know you're doing a lot with both the Apple Card and financing plan for iPhones to get your products in the hands of customers.
And then I have a follow-up.Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerI think there are things from just a great reminder of how important our products are and -- for remote work.
And so we expect our digital services to continue at the same level of performance that we have seen during the March quarter.
And that includes the App Store, of course, our video business, our Music business, cloud services, so we expect all these businesses to continue to grow very strongly.Given the overall economic environment, the level of demand right now, there are two businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during the June quarter.
Let's look quickly across the business.At the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get our latest generation of devices manufactured and into our customers' hands, our worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of the company were also sourcing more than 30 million masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring they're donated to places of greatest need in every region around the world.
And services like FaceTime and Messages set new all-time records for daily volume during this quarter as users relied on their devices to stay connected in a new reality.In software, at the same time that our teams work with great creativity and excitement as we prepare to deliver our first-ever all-online Worldwide Developers Conference later this quarter, they also worked with the same creativity and speed to put together our COVID-19 symptom checking website and app, in partnership with the CDC.
While we felt some temporary supply constraints in February, our operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work and production was back at typical levels toward the end of March.
However, on a demand basis, our performance was stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory more than we did a year ago.Importantly, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories.Services revenue followed a different trend with very strong year-over-year growth of 17%.
As Tim mentioned, we are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal '16 Services revenue during 2020.App Store revenue grew by strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions.
Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased over 30% year-over-year, reaching a new all-time high.
With this momentum, we are confident we will reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new March quarter record, with revenue of $6.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year, with strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments.
And the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 95% for iPad and 96% for Mac.In the enterprise market, businesses everywhere have been making the transition to working remotely.
We have also realigned our own retail business and enterprise teams to provide timely and relevant support to customers as they navigate new work environments.
Advertising, which is comprised of third-party agreements, our App Store search ads and Apple News ads, has been impacted by overall economic weakness and uncertainty on when businesses will reopen.For gross margin, sequential headwinds include foreign exchange, the mix within products and the seasonal loss of leverage on our product business.
And do you feel comfortable that the supply chain and the manufacturing base is well situated today to launch the traditional fall products that they used to get from Apple?Tim Cook -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah.
Apple Care is essentially comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements that we signed with our customers when they purchased our devices.
