jpmc,q4,2017,"The capital impact is $1.2 billion higher, at $3.6 billion or about 25 basis points of CET1, and our effective tax rate will be approximately 19% this year and 20% over the near term, think through 2020, after which it should start to gradually increase as certain business credit will phase out over time.
Adjusted expense of $14.8 billion was up 9% year on year, reflecting higher compensation expense as well as business growth, including auto-lease depreciation.In the fourth quarter we took an impairment charge of a little over $100 million related to certain leased assets in the commercial bank and we increased our contribution to the foundation, adding $200 million this quarter.
Revenue crossed back over the $100 billion threshold this year, which feels good: $104 billion, up 5%, $4.1 billion of which was higher net interest income, in line with guidance, benefiting from higher rates and growth, relatively modest deposit repricing but pressured by lower market NII.
We ended the year with CET1 of 12.1%, down almost 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, about 25 basis points of which related to tax adjustments and the remainder low growth.All the other ratios,as well as tangible book value per share, also reflected a combination of $6.7 billion of capital distributions and the $3.6 billion impact of tax reform.
Consumer and business banking revenue was up 16% on higher NII driven by continued margin expansion as well as strong average deposit growth.
In addition to higher rates, we continue to see organic growth within the business, as the investments we've made over the past several years have improved our clients' experience across the platform.Securities services revenue of $1 billion was up 14%, driven by rates and balances, with average deposits up 12% year on year and higher asset-based fees on record AUC given higher market levels globally.
The revenue outlook seems to be quite strong for the banking industry generally in 2018 and many investors were wondering if the 55% overhead ratio a long-term target for JP Morgan regardless of the revenue environment or could that potentially be better over the short term as we get a boost in the economy from the tax act?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYou are right.
I'm wondering if you could share your insights on how you think those activity trends will shape up in 2018.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYea. People have different points of view.Our research team is saying by up to 30 basis points in each of the next two years but know it could be better than that.
We think that we are adequately capitalized, that we should expect to have the capital ratio move down slowly over time and our strategy on potentially continuing to see dividend increases and having repurchase programs that allow us to achieve our target ratios, that hasn't changed, it just might be a bigger dollar number.OperatorOur next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystHi, good morning.
And then consumer credit, broadly speaking, auto's continued to look a little bit better and cards still within your expectation, so a lot of the focus on tax has obviously been on the potential for commercial lending to potentially pick up.
Are you seeing any change in propensity to revolve from your customers or is your balanced growth coming more from new customers or is there any increase in kind of revolve rate?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerWe actually had been on a pretty significant strategic drive to make sure that we had at a DPDC-engaged customer base, if you go back pre-crisis and look at the industry there was lots of [Inaudible] and less-engaged customers.
You know that the ultimate impact for your business shouldn't be material and at the same time, the guidance from some of your foreign bank competitors, suffice it to say, has been much more measured.I'm wondering if the impact's not that material for you guys but weighs more heavily on the peer set, do you actually see your market-share consolidation opportunity emerging in particular within the repo and sec-lending side?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
I'm just trying to think through how you might tweak your business model to focus on some of your products in some of those markets.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. And if you think about something as first-order as housing in high-tax states, people are pretty situated where they live with their families and their jobs, and higher-income borrowers are typically less price-sensitive.
So, hopefully, the monetary policy will be gradual and as expected and we will continue to see the front-end rates and everything be rational, and of course there could be surprises but at some point, yes, but not in the near future.Could you say what's the average maturity of your corporate loan book or across the loan book in general?It differs.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt's clearly disclosed in the 10-K, but it's different for every single product, and it also changes, interest rates move around.OperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystHi. Good morning.
And if you are talking about a very, very scaled, very, very high-volume business with extraordinarily tight margins, it will probably have ultimately or at least in the very, very near term less impact but, again, I actually think people to be quite disciplined how they think about this.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerCan I give you an example away from finance?
So, I can tell you that looking at that decomposition of, what's higher market levels and higher flows by region and looking at the portion of our revenues that related to assets under custody that they were in line.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd full-year effect doesn't happen for 12 months.
Finally, on the potential impact to our businesses, the modernization of the U.S. tax code is a significant step forward for the country and a big win for the economy, and we include an estimated 20 to 30 basis points of growth in the U.S. this year and next.
Revenue of $25.5 billion was up $1.1 billion, or 5% year on year, as net interest income was up $1.3 billion, mainly reflecting the impact of higher rates and continued strong loan and deposit growth, partially offset by lower NII in market.
We continued to grow core loans, up 8% year on year, driven by home lending, up 13%, and business banking, card, and auto loans and leases were each up 6%.Consumer deposit growth was strong, up 7%, and we believe we are maintaining our sizable lead over the market despite an industrywide slowdown given rising rates.
Our originations were down 15% in a market down an estimated 25%, and we gained share, a trend we expect to continue given our investments.Card and merchant services and auto revenue was up 11 % year on year on higher auto lease income, growth in card loan balances and margins, and lower net acquisition costs.
The overhead ratio was 55% for the quarter, 56% for the year, as the business moved past the impact of investments and started generating positive operating leverage in the second half of 2017.Finally, on credit, card charge-offs came in line with guidance for the year, at 2.95%.
Expense for the quarter of $2.3 billion was up 8% year on year, driven by a combination of higher compensation as well as a growth [Inaudible] for external fees, which is offset in revenue.For the quarter we saw long-term net inflow of $30 billion, with positive flows across all asset classes on continued, strong long-term performance.
We estimate for the full-year impact will increase both revenues and expenses for the firm by another $1.2 billion, the vast majority of which will be in asset and wealth management with a small amount in the CIB.So for guidance, expect the first-quarter NII will be down modestly quarter on quarter, reflecting a combination of a lower growth, as I mentioned, as well as normal day count, which offset the benefits of higher rates and growth.
So to wrap up, the end of 2017 was constructive, characterized by strong equity markets, higher interest rates, good economic base globally, decent client activity, high levels of confidence, and obviously the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Against that backdrop, our underlying financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 was strong, benefiting from diversification and scale, and consistently delivering for our customers and communities, gaining share across our businesses.Adjusting for significant items in the year, net income and EPS would have been [Inaudible], driving a healthy 13% return on tangible common equity.
So, we just need to, I think, be a little patient to see some of that play out but sentiment is strong, tax positions will be improved, profitability will be higher, things that were rich before will be more fairly valued now.So, I think it should be all very constructive and certainly we would take the upside and support our clients.OperatorOur next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystHey, good morning.
If I think about, your guidance for the first quarter, down slightly, you have two less days in the quarter, that's maybe almost $300 million sequentially and then half of the impact from the tax act in terms of tax-equivalent adjustments that's going to be [Inaudible] NII, sort of linear and equal.So that's another $150 million.
So, my expectation, just given where we are in the absolute level of rates, is on the retail space, we would still see a lot of discipline in the market in 2018 but ultimately we haven't changed our expectations that whatever that pipeline looks like, we're going to get to an overall reprice of above 50% but we'll have to see.OperatorOur next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Betsy.OperatorMs. Hi, good morning.
Do you feel like it's equal across those or is there a skew that you're thinking about to take advantage of this because how managements use this benefit is going to be critical for stock performance over the next two to three years.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerI'll give you a framework to think about it if it's helpful, and you can certainly ask a follow-up question, but you are very familiar with the way that we think about sort of our strategy over time and our investment strategy in particular, and investing in our businesses, growth and profitability has always been first and foremost in our minds and, to be honest, we've talked to you before about the fact that we don't constrain ourselves because we have budgetary targets on those activities if we think we can execute well and we see great opportunities.
You did build the reserve for growth, as you mentioned, but most of the card revenue rate was also still a little bit down.Can you just talk a little bit about your outlook for that card business as you look forward?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, I'll just deal with the card-revenue rate real quick, because I think we sort of gave a little bit of this in the third quarter that given the Sapphire Reserve products, given the extraordinary success we had with that in the fourth quarter of 2016, there is annual travel credit renewal that took place in the fourth quarter, which we already told you you would expect, to see the revenue-rate go down.
And then the philosophical question, if Jamie's there, if he can answer after you, should that be crucial for stock performance, how much you allow to fall to the bottom line?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerLook, I'm not going to give you quantification, but you're not meaningfully wrong about the sort of assessment you made, which is a big, significant positive and most of it will fall through our bottom line in 2018 and beyond and time is an important part to how it plays out.
It will enhance our growth in the future too, by the way, it's not a giveaway.It's kind of a thoughtful approach to how we should use some of this.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd I do want to just say, there are two other things just to add to what Jamie said, which is, if some of this is competed way out over time, and gets to a lower cost of credit and cost of borrowing and improved pricing for our customers and allows them to grow their businesses and spend more strongly, there is a feedback loop.
So, you, Marianne, or Jamie, a year from now do you think that the tax code or other factors will result in increase in capital markets activity, increase in corporate lending and increase in CAPEX, which we've been waiting for all decade?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAgain, I think it is really important to note people focus very much what happens to [Inaudible] in the tax reform and I think it's a very good thing.
Marianne, I was wondering about charge-offs and credit.Things look good this quarter for the full year, came in line with your kind of $5 billion charge-off outlook.
Would you change it or you want to just keep it the way it is?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYea. I mean, for what it's worth, we should know our house view on interest rates is for there to be four hikes next year.
Can you talk to that a little bit and speak to which products and businesses you see more scope for competition, less scope for competition, and how does that influence how you think about investing in, across your different businesses?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, I would start by saying that I think we showed at Investor Day last year and if we could do something similar, maybe we will.

jpmc,q1,2018,"To put this quarter's performance into context, on a core basis, pre-tax earnings grew 13% year-on-year, benefiting from higher rates, solid growth across other revenue drivers, and continued investments in our businesses.
And even excluding the benefit of tax reform, net income was a clear record this quarter.Included in the results you see on the page, approximately $500 million of mark-to-market gains on certain investments previously held at cost due to the adoption of a new accounting standard.
So the reduction was driven by higher risk-rated assets, reflecting the increased level of market activity, which similarly impacted all other ratios.In the quarter, the firm distributed $6.7 billion of capital to shareholders and last week, we submitted our 2018 CCAR capital plan to the Federal Reserve.
But also, based upon our data, they appear to spending more, reflecting a continued high level of confidence.Client investment assets were up 13% year-on-year, with half of the growth from net new money flows and with record flows this quarter.
The Card revenue rate was 11.6% in the quarter.Expense of $6.9 billion was up 8% year-on-year, driven by investment in technology and marketing, higher auto lease depreciation, and continued underlying business growth.
In addition, we saw share gains in cash and continued client activity driving growth in prime, as the investments that we've made in the business are paying off.Treasury services and security services revenue were both $1.1 billion for the quarter and up 14% and 16%, respectively, driven by higher rates and balances.
And you will recall that last year included a legal benefit and last quarter, of course, included the impact of tax reform.Finally, turning to Page 10 and the outlook, given Investor Day is only six weeks behind us, we've not changed our guidance for the full year of 2018.
And while acknowledging the tailwinds of tax reform and higher rates, the consistent performance of business drivers is translating into top-line growth and positive operating leverage, with revenues and pre-tax income both up double digits year-on-year.So with that, Operator, we can take some questions.Questions and Answers:OperatorCertainly, ma'am.
Kind of pros and cons, where do you have LIBOR sensitivity on the asset side and where do you have it on the funding cost, sensitivity to LIBOR, and how should we think net about that?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYeah.
But a bit of the sort of outsized year-on-year increase is seeing the somewhat tailwind of Card and Markets, both in the trading and in the asset management space.OperatorOur next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHi, thanks very much.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentHey, Glenn.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHello.
The simple question I have is, hearing you loud and clear on everything related to risk-based capital, but the clear improvement on the leverage side and SLR, does that theoretically, I know this is just a proposal right now, would that theoretically free up more activity in repo land and other short-term investments that soak up leverage, capital, but not much risk-based capital?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentSo generally across the sort of whole industry, I suspect the answer to the question is yes.
So this will unfold over the course of the next year or so.OperatorOur next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentHey, Matt.Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGood morning.
And you saw the balance sheet also go up and risk-rated assets and so on.OperatorOur next question is from Erica Najarian of Bank of America.Erica Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystHi, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentHi, Erica.
Morning.Erica Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystSo my first question to you, Marianne, is, if the Stress Capital Buffer becomes final as proposed and now the industry has a BAU CT1 minimum that could move year to year, how does that change your outlook on how to think about dividends and buybacks from here?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentOkay.
And so whether it's in a higher or lower SEB or whether it has to be taken into consideration so that we aren't caught sideways from a test result that is, with respect, once a year and a little big opaque.The second thing I would highlight to you is, for what it's worth, we saw our Investor Day, I won't say guidance, but sort of indication that we would expect to try and have payouts at or around 100%, plus or minus.
Shouldn't we expect securities yields to be moving higher in this environment?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYes, you should.
Are you feeling just better or was it also related to kind of just the growth math starting to look a little bit better in Card and Auto?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentSo I would say we still feel really good about the consumer.
Any updated thoughts on just that trajectory and where you expect that to go over time now?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYeah.
Probably higher for the year.OperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentHi.OperatorMr. Martinez, your line is open.
And could you give us some color on what you guys are seeing geographically on deposit growth and the competition?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYeah.
Are you still on that trajectory of where you think you should be?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYeah.
Against that, there were a number of other smaller but nevertheless notable items, including changes in credit reserves, FDA investment securities and private equity losses, and legal, which together substantially offset those gains.Underlying results continue to be strong: average core loan growth, excluding the CIB, of 8% year-on-year; card sales and merchant processing volumes up 12% and 15%, respectively; we maintained our No. 1 rank in global IB fees; and have net income of $1 billion in the commercial bank.
Non-interest revenue was up $1.6 billion year-on-year, and while this includes the mark-to-market gains on the first page, it also includes approximately $400 million of losses on investment securities and negative private equity investments.Adjusted expense of $16 billion was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher compensation expense as well as business growth, including auto lease depreciation.
In wholesale, we had a net reserve release of about $170 million driven by a single oil and gas loan.You'll see that our effective tax rate for the quarter ended a little above 18% compared to the 17% guidance we gave, driven by a combination of higher pre-tax earnings as well as geographical mix.
Consumer and Business Banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued by continued margin expansion and deposit growth.
Recall, last year included a net impact of a little over $200 million related to the student loan portfolio sale.Turning to Page 6 and the Corporate and Investment Bank.
1 in global M&A wallet and gain share in every region and, for the quarter, we announced and completed more deals than any other bank.Equity underwriting fees were down 19% in a market that was also down and versus a strong first quarter last year, which included a number of large deals.
Accounting for both of these items, Markets revenues would have been up about 7%.Fixed Income Markets adjusted revenue was flat versus a strong first quarter last year, with rates and spread markets reverting to more normal levels following significant outperformance last year, being offset by strong emerging markets and commodities performance.It was a record quarter for equities, as revenue was up 25%, a well-diversified story, driven by broad strength and continued momentum throughout the quarter, with increased volatility benefiting all equities derivatives.
Securities services also benefited from asset-based fee growth on both market levels and new client activity.Finally, expense of $5.7 billion was up 9% year-on-year, half being higher compensation expense, with a comp to revenue ratio of 29%, and the remainder primarily driven by higher transactions costs in markets.Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 7, another very good quarter in this business with net income of $1 billion and a ROE of 20%.
Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven primarily by higher management fees on growth in AUM as well as higher NII on deposit margin expansion and loan growth.
Adjusted, expense would have been up 8%, driven by higher external fees on revenue as well as higher compensation.For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $16 billion, including $5 billion in active equities, with strength across all regions benefiting from strong long-term performance.
We saw net liquidity outflows of $21 billion, largely driven by a combination of recent M&A activity and the impact of cash repatriation due to tax reform.AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were up 10% and 9%, respectively, on higher market levels globally as well as the inflows.
And so we wouldn't expect our behavior to change materially.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Michael Mayo -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystHi.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentHi.Michael Mayo -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystCan you just give a little bit more of your expectations for Consumer?
I'm wondering if you could give us some color on how the LIBOR changes impacted trading.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYeah.
How do you think about reserving and your expected loss rates going forward?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice PresidentYeah.

jpmc,q2,2018,"Our return on tangible common equity was 17%, and also included in the results were two notable items, which I will call out in a moment, excluding which EPS would have been about $0.10 higher.The strength this quarter was broad-based across businesses, and highlights included average core loan growth excluding CIB of 7% year on year, consumer deposit growth of 5%, which we believe continues to outpace the industry, FOB sales up 11%, and client investment assets and merchant processing volumes each up 12%.
Net interest income was up $1.1 billion or 9%, reflecting the impact of higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower markets and II.
Credit costs of $1.2 billion were flat year on year and credit trends remain favorable across both Consumer and Wholesale.Shifting to balance sheet and capital on Page 3, we ended the second quarter with CET1 of 11.9%, up about 10 basis points versus the last quarter, and most of the capital generated was returned to shareholders.
Consumer and business banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion as well as deposit growth.
Treasury Services and Security Services revenue were each up 12%, driven by higher rates and deposit balances, and security services also benefited from higher asset-based fees on new client activity and higher market levels.
Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 7 basis points.Moving on to Asset and Wealth Management on Page 7, Asset and Wealth Management reported net income of $755 million with a pre-tax margin of 28% and an ROE of 33%.
Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 4% year on year, driven by higher management fees on growth in long-term products as well as strong banking results.
Expense of $2.6 billion was up 6%, driven by continued investment in advisors and technology as well as higher external fees on revenue growth.For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $4 billion with positive flows across multi-asset equities and alternatives, partially offset by outflows in fixed income.
Finally, we had record loan balances up 12% with strength in global wholesale and mortgage lending.Moving to Page 8 and Corporate, Corporate reported a net loss of $136 billion.
I wanted to ask you what you're seeing this quarter in terms of consumer deposit trends with a little more color on both the pricing data and volume balances.
Looking forward, the overall pipeline remains strong.Moving on to Markets, total revenue was $5.4 billion, up 13% year on year or up 16% adjusting for the impact of tax reform, and was driven by strong results in equities, solid performance in FIT across categories, and with performance picking up in the second half of the quarter.
Fixed income markets revenue was up 12% adjusted on the backs of good client flow and decent volatility, and with commodities making a notable recovery from a challenging prior year.It was a record second quarter for Equities, with revenue up 24%, driven by strong client activity and favorable trading results, and with particular strength in cash, prime, and flow derivatives.
So, we are seeing our digital effort pay off, and even more broadly than that, we could go into QuickPay and Zelle and the like, but I wouldn't focus overly on FIN as isolated thing, but think digital more broadly.OperatorOur next question is from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.James Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystHey, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerMorning, Jim.James Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystMaybe just talk a little bit about loan growth.
What are you guys seeing on the ground, and do you think what we've seen so far is a good indicator for a more sustained pickup in growth?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerI would say that we would -- if you use the Commercial Bank C&I loans as a kind of bellwether, there has been decent demand, and I mentioned it in my remarks, but decent demand -- not exclusively, but partially on the back of a very robust and active M&A environment.
But, through the cycle, I think that we've proven that our business model will produce strong shareholder returns and among best-in-class performance.OperatorOur next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Mike.
So, while there are other factors weighing potentially on the 10-year in terms of still very accommodative central bank policy, particularly in the banks of Japan and the ECB, where obviously, trade is not necessarily constructive just in terms of the narrative, short-term underfunded pensions going into bumps -- there are some technicals, but fundamentally, what you're seeing in terms of the flattening is pretty typical of a tightening cycle, and as long as it's accompanied with solid to strong economic growth, it doesn't concern us at this point, and in fact, as we've been pointing out, we are still levered toward fund rates from a profitability perspective, and we do expect the curve to steepen over time.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Managing DirectorAll right, thank you.OperatorOur next question is from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Glenn.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorHi. Just one follow-up on the competition conversation.
And, just an add-on to that -- I'm just curious if part of the competition has anything to do with the private credit market that seems to be growing pretty strongly.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerI would say just a tiny little correction -- our outlook was 6% to 7% core loan growth excluding the CIB.
Good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHi.Saul Martinez -- UBS Financial Services -- Managing DirectorSo, just following on the theme of economics and policy, to what extent do you see trade friction, geopolitical concerns, those things starting to impact client sentiment, whether it's institutional or corporate clients?
The European sovereignty situation -- so, there's just more catalysts in the market, and just generally, more client participation.OperatorOur next question is --Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSorry, to finish that to make sure that no one is confused, it was pretty broad-based, it was pretty consistent throughout the second half of the quarter, and it wasn't a lot of one-off large trades.OperatorAnd, our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorGood morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorJamie, I wanted to ask about the China investment.
Ultimately, I think it'll be good for China to have a company like J.P. Morgan equity, debt, credit, transparency, governance issues, inside China.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorBut right now, today, the ability to operate in Shanghai...?Jamie Dimon -- Chairperson and Chief Executive OfficerLook, we already do deposits and certain banking.
We just want the full capability.OperatorOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Managing DirectorGood morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Managing DirectorMarianne, can you share with us -- and, correct me if I'm wrong -- I think you guys have given us some color in the past about the impact of the Fed taking down their balance sheet over the next three to five years by a couple trillion dollars, that it will impact your deposit side of the balance sheet.
So, I'd say generally, terms are holding up quite well.Jamie Dimon -- Chairperson and Chief Executive OfficerOn the competition issue, I think it's good for the country -- the United States -- if we have a fully competitive card, mortgage, retail, asset management, commercial banking, investment banking, sales and train -- there are strong competitors everywhere.
Just wanted to get some color on that.Jamie Dimon -- Chairperson and Chief Executive OfficerThat was actually credit.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerCharge-offs -- so, in CIB, the charge-offs were driven by two names, and the principal one was the remaining piece of the Steinhoff loan that we sold this quarter.
We had a reserve release against it that was larger.OperatorOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Managing DirectorThank you.
Just a follow-up, Marianne -- on the capital return that you guys were approved for in terms of the share repurchase, is that going to be spread out evenly over the next four quarters, or will it be more front-end-loaded?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerWe haven't disclosed that, but if you look at our historical pattern, it's pretty even.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Managing DirectorVery good.
But, for us, the reason why it's pretty limited -- not to say there's no other impact, but the reason why it'll be mostly driven by the areas I mentioned is because in most of our wholesale space and so many of our other products, we are covered for multiple years, if not close to life-of-loan, at this point.OperatorOur next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerWow, we're popular today.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Managing DirectorYeah, I thought I'd join the party too.

jpmc,q3,2018,"On deposits, while we continue to benefit from the normalizing rate environment, as expected, balances are down year on year, bases are trending higher, and we are seeing some migration at the top end to higher-yielding investments.Expense of $853 million was up 7%, as we continue to invest in the business, in banker coverage, and technology initiatives.
Thank you.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, I would say -- I would pick up on the tone that you had in your question, which is the level of rates is not surprisingly high, and so, from our vantage point, we're not seeing anything in terms of looking at our client dialogue or, for that matter, at the credit trends that would suggest that this is problematic.
With higher rates -- and, we do this all the time -- we obviously look at all of our portfolios and stress them for shocks of up 100 basis points, even up 200, although, clearly, where we are now, risks are more symmetric.But, there doesn't seem to be any extraordinary stress that becomes evident, even if you -- obviously, at the margin, you're going to get more, but it doesn't seem to be overwhelming, and I think it speaks to the fact that low rates have been for a long time, people have had the chance to get prepared, there is a lot of liquidity, and in the corporate space in particular, people have been able to hedge.
So, I'm not saying that there couldn't be select downgrades, I'm not saying that at the margin, there may not be some incremental stress if rates continue to go much higher, but that's not where we are right now.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorOkay, thanks very much, Marianne.OperatorYour next question comes from Steve Chubak with Wolfe Research.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Executive DirectorHi, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerMorning, Steve.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Executive DirectorI wanted to start with a question on the You Invest launch.
And, it's really just our effort to understand the long-term strategy given that the pricing is quite competitive, but at the same time, the marketing effort has been fairly minimal so far.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerRemember, You Invest -- it's early.
Obviously, we have no crystal ball as to the timing in part of these things, but it is playing out arguably a little slower than we thought, but like we thought, and I would say that our outlook for deposit growth is for it to be slower, but still positive.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorGood morning, how are you?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerGood, how are you?Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorGood, good.
I know you've given guidance on that before, but given the sharp backup that we got over the last couple of weeks, how's that impacting your forward look on that?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerOn the asset side of the balance sheet, a big rule of thumb is a little less than half our loans are variable indexed to a primer LIBOR, so what we've been seeing -- in any one quarter, there can be noise on one-time items, mix, or whatever else, but largely speaking, for every rate hike we've been seeing on the front end, we're seeing our assets repriced about half of that.
So, I actually think that our outlook is still quite optimistic on the global economy, not to say -- to Jamie's point -- that there aren't some risks out there.And so, as we continue -- and also, just to talk about monetary policy for a second, everything -- given that growth outlook -- is lining up for a December rate hike, and for more hikes into 2019, and the continuation, hopefully, for a steeper yield curve, and that all should be constructive for bank stocks.
And, just as a follow-up, I picked up in part of your response to an earlier question, Marianne, as we think about your wholesale loan trends year over year, which continue to outpace the banking industry, could you tell us a little bit more about the dynamics in terms of competition from non-banks, particularly in private middle-market lending?
Marianne pointed out that wages are going up, participation is going up, credit has been pristine, housing is in short supply, confidence -- both small business and consumer -- is extraordinarily high, and that could drive a lot of growth for a while in spite of some of the headwinds out there.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerI also think -- not exactly, but if you went back and looked a couple of years ago what the two-year forward 10-year rate would look like, it would look much like this.
And, in the absence of giving you guidance, I would just point you to the fact that we're still targeting -- not targeting, but we're still expecting an overhead ratio to be around the mid-50s over the medium term, which, on revenue growth, implies we're going to continue to invest, and there's also volume-related costs associated with that.OperatorYour next question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein.John McDonald -- Sanford C.
And, just as a follow-up, I was just wondering how rising rates are affecting competition and capacity in the mortgage business, and whether the regulations in mortgage have made you open to reconsidering getting back into some areas that you exited after the crisis.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, mortgage being a cyclical business as it is, we are -- on higher rates -- expecting the overall market to be down about 10% year on year.
Obviously, refinances and new home sales will probably be down because of the rates a little bit.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd, you're right, there's excess capacity in the market right now, and that will clear -- it will clear itself out over the course of coming months, and we're in this for relationships, not volumes, and margins are under pressure as a result, but they will stabilize.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd, that is an area, by the way, where all the riskier lending has gone to non-banks, pretty much.OperatorYour next question comes from Al Alevizakos with HSBC.Al Alevizakos -- HSBC -- DirectorHi, thank you.
Sorry.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe risk the wallet will go down.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, I'd like to say on the margin point, it's been the case that particularly in the more liquid space, you've seen margins coming down consistently over the years, so it's not necessarily that this is some sort of step change or new phenomenon, but it's competitive, so that's what we're seeing.
Are you still seeing the same potential for growth in both the on-balance-sheet and the leases?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, on the loan side in auto, I would say that we are losing share as we face competition from credit unions and captives that may have economic frameworks that are different from ours.
We're very careful about how we think about residual risks and reserving on that portfolio, but it's very high-quality growth, and that looks set to continue.OperatorYour next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS.Saul Martinez -- UBS Investment Bank -- AnalystHi, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Saul Martinez -- UBS Investment Bank -- AnalystI just wanted to follow up on the question on operating leverage.
What are a couple reasons you'd just chalk it up to high level?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerIf you think about the -- we're gaining share most notably in cash and prime, and if you go back a number of years ago, we were pretty open and honest about the fact that we weren't where we needed to be in either of those two scenarios, and we have been consistently investing in the platform, and it is technology.
I also think that the relationship effects of having the equities business with our private bank and with the commercial bank -- the feedback loop -- is also quite powerful, so it has a little bit to do with our operating model, our platform as a company.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd really great research.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, great research.OperatorYour next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.Brian Kleinhanzl -- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods -- Managing DirectorThanks.
I know it's very early in the quarter, but with the trading volatility we've seen, any color that you can share with us on that as well.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, commercial loans -- we're 4% up year on year, flat to 1% up sequentially.
And so, while we don't overthink that and we do honestly think about economic capital, at some level, we have to generate a positive return for shareholders and shareholder value, and it's on these very high-credit-quality loans that we're producing, it's expensive.OperatorYour next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- DirectorThanks, and good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning, Marty.Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- DirectorI wanted to take a little bit of a different slant on deposit betas and just ask a three-part question.
Record net income for third quarter, even excluding the impact of tax reform, with key drivers being higher net interest income across businesses, reflecting continued rate normalization and solid growth in both loans and deposits, as well as very strong credit performance across all portfolios.
Highlights include average core loan growth excluding the CIB of 6% year on year, card and debit sales as well as clients' investment assets and merchant processing volumes in Consumer were all up double digits.
Net interest income was up $945 million or 7%, reflecting the impact of higher rates net of lower market NII as well as loan and deposit growth.
Non-interest revenue was up $425 million, driven by market NIR and higher auto lease income, partially offset by markdown on certain legacy private equity investments.Expense of $15.6 billion was up 7% year on year.
Chase also earned the No. 1 spot in customer satisfaction in the JD Power U.S. National Banking Satisfaction Study.Client investment assets were up 14% as we saw clear record net new money flows, more than doubling year on year, with flows accounting for more than half of the growth.
Revenue of $13.3 billion was up 10%, consumer and business banking revenue up 18% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth.
Year on year, charge-offs were down $137 million, driven by a recovery from a reperforming loan sale in home lending this quarter of about $80 million together with an approximately $50 million charge-off adjustment in auto this period last year.Excluding those charge-offs, we're about flat, but we are seeing improvement across all portfolios except for card, and in card, while charge-offs are up as newer vintages season, they are up less than expected as credit performance remains very strong.
Finally, expense of $5.2 billion was up 8%, driven by higher legal expense, higher compensation expense as we invest in technology and bankers, and volume-related transaction costs.Moving to Commercial Banking on Page 6, another strong quarter for this business with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 21%.
Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year on year, driven by higher management fees net of fee compression on higher market levels and continued growth in long-term products.
Additionally, banking results are strong.Expense of $2.6 billion was up 7%, driven by continued investment in advisers and technology as well as higher external fees on revenue growth.
And, I'm wondering -- given your fairly strong results across the board -- where is the market wrong in terms of how they're thinking about either the economy or bank revenues related to a strong economy?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerI wanted to start by saying -- I mean, there's a lot of macro uncertainty, noise, and overhang that have been affecting the markets over the last few days, so overthinking any one driver or conclusion might be challenging.
",11.29,0.4702394
jpmc,q4,2018,"And finally, as I said, we expect credit to remain favorable across products.So, to close, while the market in the fourth quarter were more challenging, we should not leave sight of the fact that 2018 was a strong year, indeed a record for revenues, net income and EPS, both reported and adjusted for tax reform.
We have good momentum coming into the year and the Company and each of our businesses are very well positioned.With that, operator, we can open up the line for Q&A.Questions and Answers:OperatorOur first question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystHi, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning, Erika.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystSo, the way Bank's stocks have performed, clearly, investors are starting to worry about revenue trends near-term and of course credit which you addressed.
I'm wondering if the revenue trends continue to be weaker than expected, if the overhead ratio of 57% that you posted in 2017 and 2018, is something that you could continue to level off to or will the investment horizon be more of a dominant factor when we're thinking about the overhead ratio?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
And I'm wondering how we should think about the dynamics of net interest income and more specifically net interest margin and deposit pricing if December was indeed the last rate hike for sometime?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo I would say, first of all, just to say that -- the question mark about whether that's a pause or a stop, is it the end of a cycle, we don't think so, we think the outlook for growth in the economy is still strong, the consumer is still strong and healthy and we're expecting to still see maybe slower but still global growth going forward.Having said that, just as a general matter, you've seen through our earnings at risk, as we have put more and more of the benefit at past rate hikes in our run rate each incremental hike from here has while still positive significantly lower sort of incremental NII drive and that the front end skew is a lower percentage.
Can that go higher from here as you maybe pull back on rewards?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I would say that, when we think about the product continually have in the constructs, rewards is a very important part of driving engaged relationships with our customers.
So we feel great that that kind of loss trend at that 310 basis points, maybe a little bit higher, is something we should look forward to at least into 2019 and it will be helped by a supportive macro environment.And we are seeing -- if you unpick all of our trends, you see the phenomenon of three vintages, you'd see the mature vintages that continue to be stable to grinding lower in terms of delinquencies and loss rates.
How much did you have to take in terms of maybe marks and leveraged loans and hung deals, a little bit of color there would be helpful.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.
And that's not to say that there is no deals that have the potential for there to be net losses after fees, but nothing that we would consider to be significant and nothing in the fourth quarter.I would also say that coming back to the first quarter, that actually the market could be quite constructive for fixed income into the first quarter given a more dovish Fed supporting corporate margin, corporate default rates is going to stay pretty low and we do have time.
Thank you very much.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo it's -- no good ever comes of talking about how we think things are going to pan out in the first quarter, other than just the general comments I've already made, which is the environment should be more constructive and we are expecting decent volatility in client activity and we'll see how that pans out.
And fixed income, we've maintained our share and we're adding products and services around the world and we don't know --Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd even gained share.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe don't know what's going to happen next quarter and I don't care.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd we take the same position, like we had strong first half of the year, and we said, loan may continue but it may not.
So in that role, what are you doing to help JPMorgan and I guess the other banks, in terms of China, the government shutdown, immigration, some of these headline issues that Marianne talked about having hurt the CIB in the fourth quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, so December is terrible, but if you look at January, you have half of it back, genuine spreads and markets and stuff like that.
In other words, things went down, spreads widened out, there was lots of fear, but it felt like the plumbing was working, but I don't want to put words in your mouth.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd half the people weren't even here the last two weeks in December.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerThat's right.
In our bridge book right now, we have, for the vast majority, we have good cushion and we expect to be able to clearing price through the market and for anything that's even borderline, it's completely not material.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think some of the field did have a few marks.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIf you look at what happened to flex pricing, like mid-December, when things were at their worst, yeah, some of these things were very close to the end of their flex pricing, and that means they're very close to having some kind of mark.
And do you get the impression that corporates had a general shift to seek borrowing from banks such as yourselves, because they were shut out of the market?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerI mean, there was an uptick at the end of the year, you saw in the industry data, we saw it in our spot data.
For us, in fact, it was largely driven by: one, investment grade loan that we extended at the end of the quarter, but there was a little bit of an uptick a little bit more in terms of acquisition financing on the balance sheet, but nothing I would call --James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer(inaudible)Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerNo. I want to circle back on the expense flexibility.
I guess, what I'm getting at is, last quarter, you had --James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe had pretty good model for it.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSorry, keep going.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystI guess what I'm getting at is, like it's -- are we at the point where like just a couple lumpy loans is going to drive a few hundred million reserve build or is it just -- maybe this is a bit unusual still?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, first of all, I just want to sort of point out that in the cards space, we hopefully continue to grow healthy mid-single digits.
There's the seasonality to cards balances and losses, so you typically see reserve builds in the second half of the year, that's what we saw this year and actually a little bit lower year-on-year than last.And in the wholesale space, you're going to see some things will be a bit lumpier and episodic given the nature of the loans that we have.
Is there any concern on your part that some of these issues have sort of a self-fulfilling effect in that, it does end up leading to actions that precipitate a downturn or a recession?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, I mean, I think that we would look to the sort of macroeconomic data, which is still generally supportive and say things should be good.
And in many of our businesses, we're going to protect profitability and credit discipline over growth at this point.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo let me just reemphasize that.
We tell our management that we have no problem seeing loan books shrink.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerCorrect.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe are not going to be sitting here ever in our lives and say you got to grow the loan book, you got to show loan growth.
I think you can have a logical conversation with kind of the non-bank loan book, but that's not our concern and it is what it is at the time, so --Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd I think where businesses are notably a little bit less relationship-driven, I think about kind of low loan new relationships, commercial term lending, real estate banking, mortgage, to a lesser degree, auto.
So, why would 1Q be a little bit different, I guess, is really the question.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. We had added more and more as the year progressed.
And then, outside of that, there's a bit more in real estate as we sort of execute on our head office strategy and then marketing, foundation completion, those things -- there are going to be timing.So the first quarter will be higher.
Thanks.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, so, I mean, it's fair to say that money market rates traded above IOER throughout the fourth quarter and more pronounced at the end of the quarter.
If you can just give us some color there what drove a negative gain on sale.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, so in the quarter, as we were looking at optimizing our balance sheet, we actually did a sale of conforming loans to the GSEs of about $5 billion.
But looking into January, again, if the market remains generally constructive, we should see tailwinds across the businesses.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think the intentional backlogs, generally, you want them high because that's good, but they're all like an accordion too, they come and go.
So our total reserves, what $14 billion?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, $14 billion and a bit.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, but at one point, they were $30 billion.
And even if it did, given the credit quality of the portfolios, performance will be not only absolutely better, but we think strong on a relative basis.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo other than if you look at the consumer that $13 trillion that's outstanding, other than student, which is fundamentally own by the government, the mortgage stuff that's been written is prime.
I think orders are about the same, but order actually outperformed in the --Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerThere's more prime.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes, more prime, and outperformed in the Great Recession.
I was just wondering, just any takeaways you had from reading that and any hopes you might have for just as we get toward some finalization of which way CECL goes and how it looks, aspirations around that and how that interacts with CCAR and such?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBefore Marianne answers that question, I just want to do a shout out to Jefferies, because we actually look at what everyone does and every investment banking group, and you guys did a hell of a good job in healthcare this year.Ken Usdin --  -- AnalystI'll pass that along, Jamie.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd following that -- it's hard to follow, I would say that we've been pretty clear about the fact that our biggest concern around CECL was like properly understanding not just for us but regulators to properly understand the implications for capital, not only in benign but in stressed scenarios, and what the implications of the outcome that it could have on the willingness of people to extend credit, particularly as cycles age and with the outlook for volatilities to increase.
And is that slowing down the Investment Banking business and your thoughts on that, please?Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, I would say that we've been -- we benefited from the fact that year-end and into the early part of January and holiday season have a light calendar, typically in January for IPOs in particular.
Market impacts aside, underlying business drivers remain solid, including core loan and deposit growth, consumer sentiment and spending in a robust holiday season, capital market activity and with credit performance continuing to be very strong across businesses.
For the full year 2018, the firm reported revenue of $111.5 billion and net income of $32.5 billion, both clear records even adjusting for the impact of tax reform, and so we're entering 2019 with good momentum across our businesses.Turning to page two and some more detail about our fourth quarter results.
Non-interest revenue was down slightly with lower market levels impacting asset wealth management fees and private equity losses being offset by higher card fees and auto lease growth in CCB.
Revenue of $111.5 billion was also a record and was up nearly $7 billion or 7% year-on-year, $4.3 billion of which was higher net interest income on higher rates with growth and card margin expansion being offset by lower market NII.Non-interest revenue was up $2.5 billion or 5% driven by CIB markets and growth in Consumer, being offset by private equity losses and the impact of spread widening on SBA.
And although we are showing modest positive operating leverage on a managed basis, remember our revenues were impacted by lower growth results given tax reform.
Credit costs were $4.9 billion, down 8% driven by lower net reserve builds in Consumer as well as the impact in 2017 of student loan sale.Moving on to page four and balance sheet and capital.
And of note, while not a material driver of overall expense, revenue headwinds here were offset by lower net production expense.And Card, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 14% driven by higher card NII on both loan growth and margin expansion.
Expense of $7.1 billion was up 6% driven by investments in technology and marketing and auto lease depreciation, partially offset by lower FDIC charges and other expense efficiencies.On credit, net charge-offs were $18 million as modestly higher charge-offs in cards were more than offset by lower charge-offs in auto and home lending.
We maintained our number one rank for the year and continued to hold strong lead-left positions in high yield bonds and leveraged loans.Moving to market, total revenue was $3.2 billion, down 6% reported and down 11% adjusted for the impact of tax reform and slight in of margin loan loss last year.
Prime continued to do well, but we saw clients deleveraging over the course of the quarter and cash and derivatives are solid in a tougher environment.Treasury Services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13% driven by growth in operating deposits as well as higher rates, but also benefiting from fee growth on higher volumes.
Underlying this was strong fee growth and a modest benefit from higher rates, together being substantially offset by the impact of lower market levels and the business exit.
Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $243 million, reflecting higher funding spreads on our derivatives.Finally, expense of $4.7 billion was up slightly with continued investments in technology and bankers, and volume-related transaction costs, partially offset by lower FDIC charges and lower performance based compensation.
Revenue of $2.3 billion for the quarter was down 2% as the prior year included a tax reform related benefits, excluding its revenue was up 3% driven by higher deposit NII.
Underlying credit performance remains strong with credit costs of $106 million including higher loan loss reserves largely due to select client downgrades.Moving on to Asset & Wealth Management on page eight.
These were partially offset by strong banking results and the cumulative impact of net inflows.Expense of $2.6 billion was flat, as continued investments in advisors and in technology were offset by lower performance-based compensation and lower revenue-driven external fees.
But net-net, we're expecting a relatively stable loss rate that leveled similar to 2018.OperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerHey, Saul.OperatorAnd I'm sorry, his line has disconnected.
We know the losses are going to go up.OperatorOur next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystAre we playing golf all day yet or is that still far away?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerCredit is pristine.
And we're completely aware of that.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerAlthough I think we could say for obvious reasons that we wouldn't expect any near-term recession if there is one to look anything like it did before.
If we're embedding these assumptions into our stress tests and our results sooner than they are, how do we think about the implications of that on our distribution plans and capital outlooks.And importantly, if it really is the case that we have to upfront significant amounts of capital for longer term and lower credit quality loans, I do really believe even though the cash flows and the economics conceptually don't change that you might find people less willing to lean into growth for longer duration assets if there are concerns around potential volatility and we should worry about that.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd it'll be a big number for like credit card.
So I do think particularly smaller banks will react fairly dramatically on how they run their loan books to do that.Marianne Lake -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, our view is that more on that just needs to be done in the industry about what this looks like.
",24.82,0.5016059
jpmc,q1,2019,"We talked at Investor Day about the fact that we're always going to make the net investment -- the net incremental investment decision based on its own merit, but in total with the amount we're spending now and the amount of dollars that roll off every year that get repositioned for investments, we feel like we should see our net investment spend reach a reasonable plateau over the course of the next several years.And so, that is -- obviously a lot of the investments that we've been making in technology are also not only to do with customer service and risk management and revenue generation, but they are also to do with operating efficiency.
So, to me, it's a combination of all of the above and less so, at this point, a perception of flight to quality, the people have a lot of choices.Year-over-year, I would say, we're seeing deposit growth slow exactly in line with our expectations, but this year the slowdown speaks a little bit more as far as we can see to higher consumer spend and a little bit less to do with deposit flows out to rate-seeking alternatives.
It's decent, but our branch growth, the reason why we continue to believe in a physical and digital combined channel presence, both are important, but we can get back to you.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHi, thanks very much.
Talk about what type of business you are winning there.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, on the business exit, this is -- it's the sort of feature of always talking about year-over-year.
And I just wanted to...Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst...get a little qualifier of that.
And our risks are that all the things that we've always told you about, which are relatively modest, relatively senior, well secured, well diversified, we look at -- losses under a variety of such scenarios are manageable.The comments are really about the percentage of leverage lending or the percentage of some of our businesses that have now been taken outside of the banking market.
So, I didn't hear the second part of the question on losses, which losses were up this year that you were mentioning, but here is what I would say.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThe Card and Auto losses.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
Net-net, it doesn't change our point of view that as we're at 12.1% CET1 right now, so arguably little bit above the high end of our range and continuing to grow earnings that we ought to be able to distribute a significant portion of earnings, but we always invest in our businesses first.So, we are growing our businesses responsibly every time we're adding branches, we're adding customers, we're adding advisors across our businesses.
But to the degree that we have excess earnings, we'll continue to distribute them and the ranges that we gave you at the end of February, nothing changed.OperatorNext question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- AnalystHi. Good morning, Marianne.
I got that, but I mean just a little bit of additional color perhaps?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
Or was there a one-off impacting that number this quarter?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerSo, you may recall that we did a mortgage loan sale last quarter and realized -- and there's geography.
It's just that each year (technical difficulty) and we'll continue to make the right decisions, and we see that being flatter going forward than it has been.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerAnd we're getting more efficient.
Thank you.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYes. So first point on Treasury Services, obviously, revenue growth was in double digits, you're right, this quarter (inaudible) year-on-year.
And so that just given where rates have moved headwind this year as the segment results are reported, but for the Company it's obviously net zero.The more important point is that organic growth underlying all of that balances and payments is holding up very well and we do expect that to continue.
So we feel good about the underlying organic growth in the business.With respect to technology spend, you'll recall last year we were kind of 60-40 run the bank, change the bank, and it's more 50-50 this year, so $11.5 billion of spend about half and half.Alevizos Alevizakos -- HSBC -- AnalystThank you very much.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerRemember, in the change of the bank, it runs the whole gamut from platforms and controls to customer experience, digital, data, R&D, so it's the whole spectrum.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGood morning.
One is small but nevertheless is arguably non-recurring, which is -- we've talked about the fact that overall in the Company when we do these loan sales that net-net there may be a small residual gain or loss that resides in Treasury, and it was a small gain in the first quarter in NII, call it, $50 million (ph) approximately.And then, in addition, we talked in the fourth quarter about the fact that we were seeing the opportunity to deploy cash in short duration liquid investments that were high-yielding than IOER that continued into the first quarter.
The curve is flat and we'll continue to manage the overall environment and company as we see the economy unfold.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay, thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America -- AnalystYes, hi, good morning.
And I'm wondering as we look at a tick-up in non-accrual loans in the Corporate & Investment Bank for the past two quarters, are we just in the part of the cycle where we're just growing from a low base or should we expect a step-down in the second quarter in non-accruals similar to how we saw last year?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerThere are a couple of situations that we would expect to maybe not be present in the second quarter, but I would say it's a feature more of extremely low base.
Marianne, just if I could ask you, you mentioned that there are some signs that the economy is strengthening, and I wanted to just ask you to can you split that between just what you're seeing on the Consumer side versus the Wholesale corporate side in terms of -- the spend numbers are obviously still double-digit year-over-year.
And then there is this unevenness about just CapEx and spending and corporate side, so just -- could you just kind of walk us through just where you're seeing pockets of relative strength and improvement?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I mean I think that as it relates to US and in particular looking at the US Consumer, you've got all of jobs more recently, auto, housing, spend all generally encouraging and holding up well and robust.
And one follow-up just on Investment Banking business, you had mentioned that the pipelines look good and obviously we've seen the reopening of the ECM market.
Right now, that's constructive for corporate deposit margins, constructive for credit, and generally constructive for how we're positioned on the balance sheet.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystIt's still you like you have room to, I guess, extend duration to kind of protect NII and NIM if that would happen?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYes, yes, we do.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystOkay.
How sustainable the results are?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerSo, first of all, just sort of big pic, first of all, really high I think is a bit of an overstatement -- higher, I think is fair.
Also on the page, total assets are up over $100 billion quarter-on-quarter, principally driven by higher CIB trading assets, in part a normalization from lower levels at the end of the year given market conditions.Lower end-of-period loans are partially offset by treasury balances, including higher securities.
And Cards, Merchant Services and Auto revenues was up 9%, driven by higher Card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and higher auto lease volumes.Expense of $7.2 billion was up 4%, driven by investments in the business and auto lease depreciation, partly offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.
We ranked number one in announced dollar volumes and gained nearly 100 basis points of wallet share.Debt underwriting fees were up 21%, also outperforming a market that was down, driven by large acquisition financing deals and our continued strong lead-left positions in leverage finance.
Finally, credit costs of $90 million were predominantly driven by higher reserves from select client downgrades and net charge-offs were only 2 basis points on strong underlying performance.Before we move on, I want to address the perceived gap between our reported C&I growth statistics and those that we will see in the Fed weekly data.
So while it's true that the Fed data is showing strong growth year-on-year and apples-to-apples (inaudible) mainstream middle market lending space, we're seeing good mid-single digit demand in line with our expectations.Moving on to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 7.
AUM of $2.1 trillion and overall client assets of $2.9 trillion were both record up 4%, driven by cumulative net inflows in the liquidity and long-term products and with first quarter market performance nearly offsetting fourth quarter declines.Deposits were up 4% sequentially on seasonality and down 4% year-on-year, reflecting continued migration into investments although decelerating as we continue to capture the vast majority of these flows.
Just kind of wondering what's driving that, is there any kind of cresting of investment spend that's going to occur in 2020 or is this kind of positive operating leverage carrying through?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
And even with these revenue pressures, we're focused on continuing to drive efficiencies, and these are good ROE businesses above mid-teens.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystAppreciate.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerI'm sorry.
It should be something that should be watched, but it's not a systemic issue at this point.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, good morning.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystI had a question for Jamie.
Great, thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystGood morning, Marianne.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystCan you share with us -- obviously you've got your de novo branching strategy moving forward.
Nominal dollars has now kind of stabilized versus what it was like again in the past five years?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerSo, I just want to reiterate something that I want to make sure you guys completely internalize, which is, we believe given the level of spend and the continued efficiency we're getting out of each dollar of spend that overall our net investment should be more flat going forward than they have in the past, but we will continue to look at every investment on its own merit.
Because if you annualize it, you're already above the full year target at $58 billion plus and obviously there's day count drag this quarter and really just puts and takes with rates and balance sheet growth, but it seems like the guidance is conservative versus where you're at right now.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerOkay.
You clearly seem more positive on the macro, and obviously things can change there, but are you approaching from the balance sheet management a little bit differently, given may be more positive macro outlook?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerWell, so, I mean, we only spoke to you most recently about six weeks ago.
And do banks have room to actually lower deposit costs if the rate curve stays this way for a prolonged period of time?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerSo, I'll just put the big contextual answer will always be the same, which is, when we think about our strategy around deposits and deposit pricing, it is 100% driven by what we're observing in our consumer behavior than what we're seeing in deposit flows.
But had it been a little bit of an air pocket here partially probably because of the soft fourth quarter, but how is that side of the business you're feeling and sounding from a backlog perspective?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
How do you think the balance sheet reacts and NII reacts to a potential for rate cut over the next 12 months?Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerRight.
Thanks a lot.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerGood morning, Marty.Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- AnalystThanks for taking the question.
And if you can give some color maybe on the quarters ahead speaking to companies' CEOs (inaudible) emerging again.Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerYes. So that's impacting mortgage loans.
So my following question is on...Marianne Lake -- Executive Vice President & Chief Financial OfficerBefore you go into that there are going to be other areas where we just won't (inaudible).

jpmc,q2,2019,"[Operator instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak.
Underlying performance for the quarter was strong with highlights including client investment assets in consumer banking up 16%, largely driven by net new money flows; in card, 11% growth in sales and 8% growth in outstanding;  No. 1 in global IBCs year to date, gaining share across all products and regions; steady results in the commercial bank with net income of $1 billion, while continuing to invest in the business; and in asset and wealth management, record long-term inflows, AUM and client assets.
Revenue of $29.6 billion was up 1.2 billion or 4% year on year as net interest income was up approximately 900 million or 7% on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher rates.
Excluding that variance and the other offsetting notable items I mentioned, noninterest revenue was about flat with strong performance in consumer across auto lease, home lending production and consumer and business banking, offset by lower markets revenue and IB fees as previously guided.
Expenses of 16.3 billion were up 2% related to continued investments in our businesses, partially offset by a reduction in FDIC charges of approximately 250 million.
And in wholesale, credit performance remained favorable with a net charge-off rate of 8 basis points, which was fully reserved for in prior quarters.
Home lending was down 17%, although excluding the MSR adjustment I just mentioned, revenues would have been up 4% driven by higher net production revenue on better margins and higher volumes, largely offset by lower NII on spread compression and lower balances.
Expenses of 7.2 billion were up 4%, driven by continued investments in the business and higher auto lease depreciation, largely offset by efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.
Fixed income markets was down 3% on an adjusted basis, with relative weakness in EMEA, partially offset by increased client activity in North America rates and agency mortgage trading due to the changing rate environment.
Revenue of 2.2 billion was down 5% year on year, predominantly driven by lower investment banking activity due to our outperformance last year and lower NII on slightly lower deposit balances.
CRE loans were up 2% with modestly higher activity in commercial term lending where clients are taking advantage of lower long-term rates, offset by declines in real estate banking where we continue to be selective given where we are in the cycle.
Revenue of 3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year on year as the impact of higher average market levels was offset by lower investment valuation gains.
Expenses of 2.6 billion were up 1% year on year as continued investments in advisors and technology were partially offset by lower distribution fees.
Revenue was 322 million, up 242 million year on year due to higher net interest income, driven by higher rates and balance sheet mix, partially offset by net losses on legacy private equity investments versus net gains in the prior year.
It simply does not make sense to own all mortgages when you can frame by standardizing and can't securitize.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got It. OperatorOur next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. So the efficiency ratio went from 56 to 55% year over year, and I guess that's with some accelerated tech spending.
OperatorOur next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst Hi. How did you approach the CCAR plan this year in relation to your long-term CET1 target of 11 and 12 that you talked about?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
So we've got much better at digital only, but we got it separated from the physical branch system.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, the digital account opening is now about 25% of our new account activity.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And we'll be doing in small business and merchant processing and all these various things.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst Got It. Thanks very much.OperatorOur next question is from Eric Compton of Morningstar.Eric Compton -- Morningstar -- Analyst Good morning.
The refact rate, embedded data centers are getting better in AI, all these things are in those numbers.OperatorAnd we have no further questions at this time.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Well, thank you very much.
And do you think how sustainable is it, 8% year-over-year growth?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
Should we expect just sort of you to continue to reduce the mortgage footprint in this rate environment?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So on the mortgage business, I would say, it was a good quarter on the back of the rally, and so we did see volumes increase and we saw some margin expansion as well, and so obviously highly rate dependent.
But importantly, I would say, we're not going to lose any valuable customer relationships over a few ticks of beta, and so we'll see how it goes.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It's all embedded with your assumption.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And it's all embedded in --Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Got it.
Should we think about this as part of the overall, you're saying optimizing capital and liquidity, and therefore, as we think about it going forward, we could also expect to see perhaps some release in RWA growth and some release in the continued reserve release as part of the optimization?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
Having said that, on reserves, I mean reserves are not necessarily going to be impacted directly by that because of course that will depend on the environment and the mix of the portfolio that remains.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And I would just say that our standardized capital ratio is a 12.2%, advanced is 13%.
We're going to do it regardless of the environment, and we'll try to get more efficient in tech spend, too.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right, and our investments in technology create capacity in terms of productivity to continue to invest and we've talked a lot about AI, machine learning.
It's early innings there and there is a lot that we're going to be able to do assuming that's there and become more productive and then cloud -- developers can become more productive using the cloud.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Look, it's amazing, our forward costs with all the things around the world today are down because of techniques with AI and big data and stuff like that.
Can you tell us either size of loan sales or what average loan growth was up year on year without that?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So yes, there's a few things going on in loan growth, as you say it, Glenn.
Or are you doing anything actively to manage that lack of mix shift?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So as I said, we are seeing balances stabilize in the commercial bank and AWM.
In other words, if we think about if the ongoing rate in current environment persists into next year after the two or three cuts this year, are we looking at a billion, or is it way too complex to oversimplify like that?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, it's probably more complicated, Glenn.
So we can expect that to continue.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Is it more the market -- as you just referenced the retail sales, they were strong, is it more that or are you guys also seeing gains in market share that gives you an added boost?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes, we have taken share in -- a little bit of share in card.
So we're going to take and give our clients more and better advancement cheaper all the time, and now we package that with Sapphire Banking or Sapphire card or discounts and mortgages that are not always made to be seen, but the future is very bright because if we can do more for our customers, that's a very good thing.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And don't forget, on credit cards, you get charge-back rights and you get flows.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Right.
And so as I said in the presentation, we've had over 60 million Chase offers activated and so this is really powerful and benefits not just our consumers, but our large merchant clients at zero cost to us.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst So a message of more efficient, less cost maybe needs to get heard on the hill as well.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, and we talked about it a lot of time and a lot of people understand that, and of course we always want to do a better job for our consumers, which we have been referring.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Yeah.
Is there something or is there an offer that you have for them or are you considering that because that I'm just thinking about where fintech is trying to exploit you and I know it's a catchphrase under-banked that is being used by Libra, it doesn't necessarily to me seem like it's solving anything for them, but maybe you've got a better solution that we just don't focus on.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, so we have --  some of the stream in Chase we have 25% of branches around my neighborhoods.
We think we'll do a great job for them and when they do have complaints, we'll fix it.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right.
And Jen, did you say what the amount of the gains that you had on the loan sales this quarter?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Just if you get a higher return on REIT body, you get IOER, you're going to do that.
If you get a higher return using standardized capital on securities or on home loans, you're going to do that, and that's what we're seeing in some of these banks.Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right.
And you said earlier, you would have cut back on technology, but are other areas in expenses, you think about managing the balance sheet and liquidity a little bit different?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
We will always continue to invest in the things that we think are important, but we would have that opportunity depending upon the opportunity to take a look at that.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Remember, in a real recession, there are always opportunities to reduce your costs and vendors pull all those themselves, they will give you better deals and stuff like that.
Is it your expectations that you will use it all or is that still to be determined based on balance sheet growth, stock price and the environment?Jen Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer I would say still to be determined.
And as you know it's over four quarters, and so we have time to think about it, but obviously, we have the flexibility.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst Is the timing of that even, or is there a flexibility there, too?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It has been in the past, but we can change that every day.OperatorOur next question is from Saul Martinez of UBS.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst Hey, good morning.
",35.38,0.75973314
jpmc,q3,2019,"And curious if you think we need changes in the structure of the markets to function better on a go-forward basis.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So if I remember correctly, you got to look at the concept of -- we have a checking account at the fed with a certain amount of cash in it.
JPMorgan declined -- in any event, it's about how the regulators want to manage the system and who they want to intermediate when the time comes.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And it's worth noting, Glenn, that the overall impact to JPMorgan from the events in mid-September was not material one way or another to our third-quarter results.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst Yes. OK.
But the fourth quarter of '19 in terms of run rate is not a bad place to start.OperatorOur next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Hi.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Hi, good morning.
Is it going to be something that we're not going to see in the revenues because it's too small to matter to you?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I couldn't say.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. But like I said, we will be managing and fully intend to be in the 3.5% bucket.
As you think about the cross current of resolution planning, LCR, and liquidity stress testing, could you help us -- what is the level of excess deployable cash at JPMorgan?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I said we have $120 billion in our checking accounts with the fed, and it goes down to $60 billion and then back to $120 during the average day.
So that's what I was referring to.In terms of investment securities, when you look at the increase this quarter, there's a few things going on.
And so we have realized significant productivity to date in not only in our technology investments, but other investments and think still have room to run.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer As you said, in our merchant processing systems, and API store for the CIB.
And maybe at Investor Day, we can go a little bit more into how we try to manage the technology budget.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I'd like to just -- and then our call centers, Mike, we don't necessarily think about it just in terms of the number of people.
But we're always making sure that the people in our call centers and the overall productivity of the call center is increasing.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. And with all the cyber stuff you read about, our fraud in cards and consumers come down, not gone up because of some of these deployed technologies in call centers.
And how you're thinking about that going forward?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
And is it possible that you can continue to grow that?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So I mean, there's no doubt that the business will be impacted by rate headwinds, as the implieds play out.
But did you get a little bit more traction on lowering those rates as you went into the -- going into the fourth quarter?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer OK.
And then when you sold the loans this quarter, those mortgage loans, and replaced them with securities, was that related to liquidity or just the decisioning process on that?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So the loan decision is because we are at standardized capital now, which I think, by the way, risk -- I mean, the advance is far more important, and we should probably report more than that because that's 13%.
Volcker is a slightly different thing.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer And then, Marty, I think you asked about fourth quarter.
But with all this mixing into your last point there about where the deposit margin pressure comes in, do you expect the constitution of deposit growth to change at all, whether it comes from the consumer business, wholesale or the wealth management complex?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
But fourth quarter is a seasonally high quarter for us, and so we still expect to hit that 11 50%, plus or minus, for the full-year guidance, so just seasonality.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And that's -- and the thing I'd add here, it doesn't have the same compression that it does in deposits.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. That's one to follow-up on.
And how much of a swing factor is the duration change that you did in the third quarter helping that?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer So I mean, we're doing that based on the latest implieds.
So I think it's important to take it with a health warning that's on the latest implied because that is, of course, what we know.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And it's assuming some balance sheet growth, as opposed to all things being equal.
That would be worse.Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer That's right.
Is there a way to kind of break out what was the impact of the potential marks on investments versus true equity trading revenues?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
Or do you plan on doing that prior to the adoption date?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Well, as we said at Investor Day, the range is $4 billion to $6 billion.
Is that in these numbers in 3Q or that comes in, in 4Q?Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer That was in prime balance I think you're referring to.
Underlying performance continue to be strong with highlights including client investment assets in consumer banking, up 13%; strength in our consumer lending businesses, in particular on higher origination volume in home lending and auto; and healthy growth in sales and outstandings in card; No. 1 in global IB fees year to date with over 9% wallet share and record growth IB revenues in middle market; and in asset and wealth management, we saw record AUM and client assets.
SC sales loans were up 3% on healthy growth in card and AUM.Total deposits were up 5%, with strength across wholesale and retail, and credit performance remained strong across business.
Record revenue of $30.1 billion was up $2.2 billion or 8% year on year as net interest income was up $293 million or 2% on balance sheet growth and mix, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates.
Noninterest revenue was up $1.9 billion year on year or 14%, driven by strong performance across fixed income markets and consumer lending, which included a gain on mortgage loan sales of approximately $350 million.
CCB generated net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32% with continued deposit growth and total loans down 4% year on year.
In consumer and business banking, we saw strong deposit and investment growth year on year with deposits up 3% and client investment assets up 13%, reflecting continued growth across both physical and digital channels.
Home lending revenue was up 12% on higher production volumes and margins, partially offset by lower NII on lower balances, which were down 12%, reflecting loan sales.
Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 4% year on year, driven by continued investments and higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.
It was a record third quarter for investment banking fees, driven by strong performances in debt and equity underwriting, partially offset by lower advisory.
Equity derivatives performance was challenged by lower client activity and unfavorable market conditions, but prime remained strong and cash outperformed relative to the prior year.
Expenses of $5.3 billion were up 3% compared to the prior year with investments and higher revenue-related expenses partially offset by lower litigation and FDIC charges.
Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year on year with lower NII, driven by lower deposit margin, partially offset by higher non-interest revenue due to strong investment banking performance.
Gross investment banking revenues were $700 million, up 20% year on year on increased M&A and equity underwriting activity, and we saw revenues increase for both large deals and flow business with a record quarter in middle market.
Expenses of $881 million were up 3% year on year as investments in the business were largely offset by lower FDIC charges.
AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets was $3.1 trillion, both record, were up 8% and 7%, respectively, driven by cumulative net inflows into long term and liquidity products, as well as higher market levels.
Revenue was $692 million, up $795 million year on year, primarily due to higher net interest income driven by higher balances and balance sheet mix, as well as the funding offset from the lower mortgage loan sale that I mentioned earlier, all of which was partially offset by lower rates.
Could you give us a little bit more color on how you're expecting those dynamics to play out, particularly given slightly lower core loan growth this quarter and a 22% increase in investment securities balances?Jennifer Piepszak -- Chief Financial Officer Sure.
So there's a few things going on in investment securities this quarter.Jamie Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer In some cases, securities at a higher return on standardized capital than certain mortgage loans did.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Hi. So how much of that lower expense guidance is due to the deployment of technology?
And so we feel great about the continued growth there, but we won't be immune to rate headwinds.OperatorOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Can you guys give us some additional color on the investment banking backlog that you may have at the end of the third quarter?

jpmc,q4,2019,"We will now go live to the presentation, please standby.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak.
And in wholesale, we were up $504 million, largely due to reserve releases and higher recoveries both in 2018.Moving to the balance sheet and capital, on Page 4; we ended the fourth quarter with the CET1 ratio of 12.4%, up slightly versus last quarter.
Revenue of $3.7 billion for the quarter was up 8% year-on-year as the impact of higher investment valuations and average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were partially offset by deposit margin compression.Expenses of $2.7 billion were up 1% year-on-year.
And just one question on just the volume side of things, ex the mortgage loans, sales last year, you were still in that like 3% core growth and obviously you talk a lot about this, the environment and how there's been some settling out, but at a lower level.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.OperatorOur next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystHi, good morning.Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Erika.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystSo, I was hoping to get a little bit more credit on what happened in the quarter to produce such stellar results.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerSo look, on the efficiency ratio, I would say that, we run the Company with great discipline, whether it's relentlessly pursuing expense efficiencies or investing with discipline through the cycle.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi Mike.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystIs Jamie on the call?Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystI'm sorry?Jennifer A.
Is this something that you expect to remain or is this a one-off quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, that's a hard question, Mike.
But for how long that continues, we don't know.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystAnd then, Jennifer, you mentioned expense growth was 3%, it should be less than that this year.
Yes, we -- I mean there will be more disclosure about CECL in the Q for the first quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWhich means all the banks will be showing these ridiculous forecasting going forward and the differences and we'll spend time talking about that as opposed to the actual business.Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.OperatorOur next question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystHi Jennifer.Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerHi Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystA question on credit, you obviously put up some really good numbers, once again, on credit quality and I noticed that you had a nice material decline in the wholesale non-performing assets quarter-to-quarter.
Jamie, I don't know if there is anything you want to add?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo, you said it all.OperatorOur next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystHi, good morning.
And then in CRE, good growth in commercial term lending as we continue to have opportunity there, given the rate environment and then that is offset by real estate banking where we are very disciplined, given where we are in the cycle.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would just add.
We think that's the most secure way to do it.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBut very importantly, is that, that data is the data the customer agrees to give them on the basis they agree to give it to them is not unlimited access to customer data and the customer will have the ability to turn it off as opposed to today, if you gave you bank passcode to someone, they're taking your data every day, maybe even every minute and you don't even know about it because you forgot.Jennifer A.
Deposit growth accelerated in the fourth quarter across Consumer and Wholesale with average balances up 7% year-on-year.We saw solid loan growth with Card and AWM being the bright spots as average loans across the Company were up 3% year-on-year, excluding the impact of home lending loan sales from prior quarters.Client investment assets in Consumer & Business Banking were up 27% and Asset and Wealth Management, AUM, was up 19%, reflecting stronger market performance versus the prior year as well as organic growth.
We ranked Number one for the full year in global IB fees with 9% wallet share and growth IB revenue in the Commercial Bank was a record $2.7 billion.In CIB markets, we were up 56% year-on-year compared to a weak fourth quarter last year.
Revenue of $29.2 billion was up $2.4 billion or 9% year-on-year with net interest income down $220 million or 2% on lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB Markets NII.
Credit remains favorable with credit costs of $1.4 billion, down $121 million or 8% year-on-year, reflecting modest net reserve releases and net charge-offs in line with expectations.Turning to the full-year results on Page 3; the firm reported net income of $36.4 billion with EPS of $2.72 and revenue of $118.7 billion, all records and delivered a return on tangible common equity of 19%.
Revenue was up $7.2 billion or 6% year-on-year with net interest income up $2.1 billion or 4% on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher average short-term rates, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates.
Non-interest revenue was up $5.1 billion or 9%, driven by growth across Consumer and higher CIB markets revenue and expenses of $65.5 billion were up 3% year-on-year, driven by continued investments as well as volume and revenue-related costs, partially offset by lower FDIC charges.Revenue growth and our continued expense discipline generated positive operating leverage for the full year.
In the fourth quarter, CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31% with accelerating deposit growth of 5%, client investment assets up 27% and total loans down 6%.
Fourth quarter revenue was $14 billion, up 3% year-on-year.In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was down 2%, driven by deposit margin compression, largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher non-interest revenue on the increasing client investment assets as well as account and transaction growth.
Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 2%, driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business, including market expansion, largely offset by expense efficiencies.On Credit, this quarter's CCB had a net reserve release of a $150 million.
Net charge-offs were $1.4 billion largely driven by card and consistent with expectations.Now turning to the Corporate & Investment Bank on Page 7; for the fourth quarter, CIB reported net income of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.5 billion, a strong finish to the year.
Equity underwriting fees were up 10% year-on-year, reflecting strong performance in the U.S. and Latin America.The new issuance market continue to be active, and for the year we ranked number one in equity underwriting as well as IPOs. Our overall pipeline continues to be healthy and strategic dialogs with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the rate environment is favorable for debt issuance.Moving to markets; total revenue was $5 billion, up 56% year-on-year, driven by record fourth quarter revenues in both fixed income and equity markets.
Expenses of $5.2 billion were up 12% compared to the prior year with higher legal, volume and revenue related expenses, as well as continued investment.Now moving on to Commercial Banking on Page 8; Commercial Banking reported net income of $938 million and an ROE of 16% for the fourth quarter, and for the year $3.9 billion of net income and an ROE of 17%.
CRE loans were up 1% where we continue to see higher originations in commercial term lending, driven by the low rate environment, offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle.Finally, credit costs were $110 million and NPL rate of 17 basis points, largely driven by single names which was reserved for in prior quarters.
And as a reminder, the effective tax rate in the first quarter is typically impacted by stock compensation adjustments, and as a result, it's currently estimated to be approximately 17% since the managed tax rate is about 500 basis points to 700 basis points higher.So to wrap up; 2019 was a year of record financial performance across revenue, net income and EPS.

jpmc,q1,2020,"As you heard, Jamie is with me on the call, and I know I speak for the entire company when I say we are just thrilled that he's back.Before we get into the first quarter performance, we want to start by recognizing that this is an extremely challenging time for all of us and our thoughts are with those most affected by COVID-19, particularly those on the frontlines of this crisis.The presentation this quarter is slightly longer to address a few key topics as we navigate this environment, and as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back.Starting on Page 1, I'd like to highlight some of the ways we're responding to COVID-19.
And at a high level, these items are a credit reserve build of $6.8 billion, approximately $950 million of losses in CIB, largely due to the widening of funding spreads on derivatives, and a $900 million markdown on our bridge book.It might be an obvious point that the quarter was really a tale of two cities: January and February, and then March when the crisis started to unfold.
Revenue of $29.1 billion was down $782 million or 3% year on year, and net interest income was flat to the prior year due to the impact of lower rates, offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB Markets NII.
This reserve increase assumes in the second quarter that U.S. GDP is down approximately 25% and the unemployment rate rises above 10%, followed by solid recovery over the second half of the year.In addition to these macro assumptions specific to each business, our consumer reserve build reflects our best estimate of the impact of payment relief that we are providing to our customers as well as the federal government stimulus programs.And in wholesale, the majority of the build is in sectors most directly impacted by COVID-19, such as in consumer and retail and also in oil and gas.
And on the small business side, we saw significantly reduced inflows in merchant processing activity, early signs of pressure on payment and delinquency rates as well as line utilization, and increased demand for credit.Turning back to the results, revenue of $13.2 billion was down 2% year-on-year.
Based on the latest implies and what we know today, we expect to see further pressure from rates, partially offset by balance sheet growth and CIB Markets NII, which results in NII of about $55.5 billion for the full year.
In addition to the two significant items in the first quarter, these headwinds included a $3.5 billion decrease in non-interest revenue, all else equal, which is also due to the impact of rates and as we offset the higher CIB Markets NII, and therefore revenue neutral.
And, how we should think about the significant government intervention relative to the severely adverse scenarios, I believe, for total losses of 5.9% over nine quarters for the Fed and 4.1% for company run?Jennifer A.
And so, we think we have significant room to continue to serve our customers and clients through this crisis, but we are managing it quite carefully and looking at a range of scenarios, so we make sure that we're prepared.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo & Company -- AnalystHi, and welcome back, Jamie.
It's just important to note that that kind of gives you a frame of how to think about it, but there's a lot more that goes in to our reserving, including management judgment about some -- like, world-class risk management and finance people and also other analytics.
But there, we did think about a number of other scenarios that we should contemplate in reserving and we also thought about the impact, what's our best estimate of the impact of these extraordinary government programs as well as our own payment relief programs.Since then, as I noted in my prepared remarks, our economists have updated their outlook and now have GDP down 40% in the second quarter and unemployment 20%.
But maybe thinking about it a little bit differently in terms of how to attribute the CECL reserve builds, and we're not looking for specific numbers, more just directional.
And like I said, we didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it and I would say that it is our best estimate of the losses that will inevitably emerge through this crisis.
And as I said earlier, it is probably the only thing we know for sure is that that is going to change through time, but it is a recovery in the back half of the year that doesn't get us back to where we started.
So, we'll see where we land at the end of the quarter, but so far --James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJust basing, marking the positions to market effectively.Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. But, as Jamie said, they're mark-to-market at the end of the quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I would just also put this in perspective; we're adults, we know that we have a bridge loan book that you're going to have quarters where things get bad and you might lose some money.
Because like I said, all else equal, given the macroeconomic outlook that we're looking at, that we would expect to have a build in the second quarter and perhaps beyond.
But we need some time to learn.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd also, just to add on the wholesale side, kind of at one point you have an overlay about what you expect in terms of migration downward and downgrades and stuff like that.
And there we, based upon our judgment and experience in the past, we apply some percentage of pull through in the portfolio of people who will get payment release, and then we think about the impact that that could have.Again, I would say, both, while estimated for the first quarter, we'll know a whole lot more about both of them for the second quarter.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd, Jen, remind me, when we do the 10-Q for the quarter, we're going to lay out lots of these various assumption about CECL.
And to help the most vulnerable and hardest hit communities, as an initial step, we've announced $150 million loan program to get capital to underserved small businesses and non-profits, as well as a $50 million philanthropic investment.Now, turning to Page 2 for highlights on our first quarter financial performance.
And in Markets, volatility drove elevated trading volumes across products, most notably across rates and commodities, which at their peak were more than triple our average January trading volumes.And on the far right, deposit growth accelerated meaningfully in March, most notably driven by wholesale clients as they secured liquidity and held those higher cash balances with us.
In consumer and business banking, revenue was down 9% driven by deposit margin compression, partially offset by strong deposit growth of 8% that accelerated in the quarter.Deposit margin was down 56 basis points year-on-year and we expect it to decline further, given the current rate environment.
Average Card loan growth was 8% with sales up 4% over the quarter, driven by January and February activity.Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 3% driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business, partially offset by structural expense efficiencies.And lastly on this slide, credit costs included the $4.5 billion reserve build I mentioned earlier and net charge-offs of $1.3 billion driven by Card and consistent with prior expectations.Now, turning to the Corporate and Investment Bank on Page 8.
Wholesale Payments revenue of $1.4 billion was down 4% year-on-year, driven by reporting reclassification in Merchant Services.As clients focused on preserving liquidity, we experienced higher deposit levels in Wholesale Payments throughout the quarter, offsetting revenue headwinds from lower rates and payments activity.
Market volatility drove increased transaction volumes and deposit balances which offset the impact of the market correction on asset balances.In Wholesale Payments and Security Services, tailwinds from this quarter, like elevated deposit balances, maybe relatively short-lived and more than offset by the impact of low rates and potentially lower transaction volumes If the crisis is elongated.Credit Adjustments and Other was a loss of $951 million, which was one of the significant items that I mentioned upfront.
While we remain confident in our long-term target, we expect some softness in our pipeline, specifically related to M&A and equity underwriting.Expenses of $988 million were up 5% year-on-year, consistent with the ongoing investments we discussed in Investor Day. Deposits were up 39% year-on-year on a spot basis and increased about $40 billion during the month of March, with about half of that coming from clients drawing on their credit lines and holding their cash with us as they look to secure liquidity.End of period loans were up 14% year-on-year, mainly driven by increases in C&I loans in March.
Higher origination in commercial term lending, driven by the low rate environment, were partially offset by declines in Real Estate Banking as we remain selective.Credit costs of $1 billion, included the reserve build I mentioned, and $100 million of net charge-offs largely driven by oil and gas.Now, onto Asset and Wealth Management on Page 10.
These increases were largely offset by lower investment valuations.Expenses of $2.7 billion were flat year-on-year with higher investments in the business as well as increased volume and revenue related expenses offset by lower structural expenses.Credit costs were $94 million, driven by reserve builds from the impact of COVID-19 as well as loan growth.
At the same time, we saw $75 billion of net liquidity inflows driven by significant inflows into our industry-leading government funds in March, as I mentioned earlier.AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, up 7% and 4% respectively, were driven by cumulative net inflows, partially offset by lower market levels.
And we now expect adjusted expenses for 2020 to be approximately $65 billion, largely due to lower volume and revenue related expenses versus the outlook we provided at Investor Day.It goes without saying all of this is market dependent and we'll keep you updated on future earnings calls.So, to wrap up, the challenges we are all facing as the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold around the globe are unprecedented.
And right now, we are focused on serving clients and customers and we've looked at a range of scenarios, so we can ensure that we're managing our capital quite carefully.Jamie talked about an extreme adverse scenario in his Chairman's letter that we've looked at, assuming large parts of the economy remain in lockdown through the end of this year.
How do you thread the needle between supporting your customers and the country and doing all those things that you want to do while still protecting the resiliency of the balance sheet and not getting hit with unexpected litigation costs as you mentioned in your CEO letter?James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes, no, it's a very important question.
How do we think about it in terms of how much is attributed to sort of mechanistic model related changes where you calibrate your model for new economic scenario versus actual signs of stress that you're seeing in your book that maybe aren't showing up in credit measures but that you do think will show up in a reasonably short time period, call it, within the next few quarters; how much of it is growth, how much of it is mix?
And I think that has served us well coming into this crisis and we'll continue to stay close to our clients and manage that carefully.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI'll just add.
So, we're not worried about this very much.And like Jen said, so far if we look at spreads, there's probably a recovery this quarter.OperatorOur next question is from John McDonald of Autonomous Research.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystHi, Jen. Regarding credit cards, just based on payment rates that you've seen so far and maybe the draws on revolves, how are you expecting card spending and card balances to trend over the next few quarters this year?Jennifer A.
But right now, the market is performing a bit better and spreads have come in, as you mentioned.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerA couple of deals may be syndicated, hopefully might be syndicated at the end of the second or third quarter.OperatorOur next question is from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.Chris Kotowski -- Oppenheimer & Co.
At Investor Day, Jamie, you said that the real earnings, pre-provision earnings minus net charge-offs [Technical Issues].James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI don't know about you guys, we can't understand a word he's saying.Jennifer A.
But, of course, it will all depend on whether these programs ultimately are able to bridge people back to employment.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe'll surely know a lot more in 90 days.Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes.James Dimon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe'll surely know a lot more in 90 days about how this affected, what we would have expected.Jennifer A.
Piepszak -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, and to Jamie's point, what we may learn over the next 90 days is, of course, whether programs have been effective or were they just delayed losses.
