citicorp,q4,2017,"We did have a decline in markets revenue due to a less robust environment this quarter than in the period following the U.S. election last year but engagement remained strong with our target clients.For the full year, on an operating basis, we earned $15.8 billion in net income for 2017, which was nearly $1 billion more than in 2016, and our earnings per share were $5.33, up 13% from 2016.
Importantly, we remain on track to return at least $60 billion of capital in aggregate over the 2017, 2018, and 2019 CCAR cycles, subject, of course, to regulatory approval.On an ongoing basis, we expect to benefit from a lower effective tax rate going from the low 30% range down to an estimated 25% rate in 2018 with a line of sight to a 24% rate over the next two years.
And finally, the combination of a lower tax rate and therefore higher net income along with the $22 billion reduction in our tangible common equity is expected to drive a material improvement in returns, adding roughly 200 basis points to our ROTCE going forward.Turning to Slide 4, for the remainder of this presentation, we show a fourth-quarter and full-year results excluding the impact of tax reform in order to better describe our underlying trends.
Total expenses remained flat, driving over 150 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio, to just under 58%, and net income grew 6%, resulting in a 13% increase in earnings per share, including the impact of share buybacks.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 5% year over year to $667 billion as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corp Other.GCB and ICG loans grew by $41 billion in total with contribution from every region and consumer as well as TTS, the private bank, and traditional corporate lending.
This represents the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in our global consumer earnings, which we expect to translate into year-over-year earnings growth in 2018.From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs even as we continue to shrink our physical branch footprint.
However, we continue to believe an outlook for pre-tax losses of $250 million to $300 million per quarter in Corp Other is a fair run rate to expect through 2018.Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends split by core accrual revenue, trading-related revenue, and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corp Other.As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.2 billion in the fourth quarter was essentially flat to last year.
As we look to 2018, we expect core accrual net interest revenues to grow by another $2.5 billion year over year, driven by loan growth, mix improvement, and the benefit of higher rates, assuming one additional fed rate increase midyear.
Our supplementary leverage ratio declined to 6.7%, and our tangible book value per share declined to $60.40, including the full impact of the $22 billion non-cash charge related to tax reform.In summary, we made good progress in 2017, with broad-based revenue growth, positive operating leverage, earnings growth, and a sizable return of capital to our shareholders.
What are your thoughts there?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYea. When we think in terms of the dampening of some of the new terms, I think that when we, for instance, just to point to one example, when we renewed the American contract a couple of years ago, we talked to the fact that there was some additional revenue-sharing that came into play beginning in 2018.
As far as the acceleration of revenue, yes, the expectation would be revenue growth should accelerate in the second half of 2018 and then be fully visible from a full-year point of view in 2019, again, all excluding the impact that you're going to see quarter to quarter as a result of the sale of the Hilton portfolio.John McDonald -- Sanford Bernstein -- AnalystOK.
Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and [Inaudible] in Mexico consumer as well as the Asia on a core basis and maybe what kind of revenue growth expectations you might have on the international consumer front?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYea, I'd say that from the medium-term point of view, John, what we're seeing now gives us confidence in those projections that we put forward for Investor Day. So, I don't want you to think that we are upping the guidance from Investor Day, but with this performance, as I mentioned, let's stay with Mexico card, where about six quarters in a row we saw a declining revenue growth year over year in cards.
At the same point in time, retail services, we had, I think, 1% compound annual growth rate and we feel pretty good now about that looking more like a 2% growth rate, and then some additional strength coming in in retail banking as a result of the strong Citigold offering that we've got.
Thanks, John.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystHey, good morning.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerHey, Jim.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystJust maybe on the efficiency ratio, I think you've got it to a 100-basis-point improvement in 2018 but I think the target for 2020 is the low 50s, and 100 basis points will get you closer to, I guess, 57.
Well, I don't put words in your mouth.How much of it relates to toward the teaser and the promotional books and the transactor books and does that run off at the same pace at as you talked about the revenue improvement?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYea, broadly, we would expect that NIR in branded cards to also improve, the NIR percentage, to improve in the back end of this year, 2018, and then continue to show improvement on a full-year basis in 2019.
It seems like it's implying flattish fee revenues, if we kind of just take the math literally, and wondering why fees aren't expected to grow, if that is the right interpretation and just some puts and takes on the fee business.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerI don't have my line-item detail on 2018 but I don't think you're getting to the right conclusion.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOK maybe just talk about the puts and takes in the fee business where you do think there'll be some growth and where you do think there'll be some challenges.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, we continue to see strong fee growth in our TTS business, just to name one, both in cash fees as well as from the commercial cards business.
I just can't go down line-item detail by business in my head.Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerBut I think, John, if you look at, as an example, fee growth, where you think of where we've seen good growth [Inaudible], where you look in the banking products, where you look at where John talked about market-share gains in M&A, you look at what we've done in terms of the private bank, securities services, lending, those more accrual-type revenues have been strong and, again, we don't see anything in the environment that takes away from the outlook of those remaining strong.
You're in a unique position to give us a view of what it might do to some of the other non-U.S. countries that obviously are not lowering their tax rates.Do you guys have any sense on what this impact may do to some of the countries you're in that could lose businesses that come to the U.S. or something like that?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerGerard, I think it already has at least in rhetoric started to put pressure in particular on some of those higher-tax economies.
Any change in your CAPEX budget or anything else along these lines?Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerSo, Mike, when you go back and you think about what we talked about on Investor Day and the pathway to low 50s efficiency, as John described earlier, there's the concept of balance in there but it's a bit of revenue and it's expense and on the expense side, it's continued expense discipline but at the same time some investments we're making today, as an example, in the digital space where we can convert analog functions to digital functions, improve customer processes and satisfaction, at the same time get costs out.
One is we talked about one of the key elements obviously in driving the revenue growth in branded cards is the continued growth in interest earning balances and there we now have seen that growth, we've got 4% growth we quoted excluding, again, the Hilton portfolio, which is going to give us some noise, but ex the Hilton portfolio, we've gotten now 4% growth in the fourth quarter year over year.
Give us some sense of how you're managing that business.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYea. I mentioned the fact that the revenue growth is actually higher than what we had originally expected.
That's why you're seeing the growth, and you have $2 billion of core accrual net interest revenue growth for the full year, $520 million of that in the fourth quarter but just given the fact that a lot of that is coming off of the corporate loans, it's depressing the overall level of NIM at this point in time.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystYeah.
But it's our intention in the business, the growth is going to look like and feel like more coming from share gains and the consolidation of a leadership position and I think you saw that in a down-revenue, down-wallet year in terms of trading that we actually fared pretty well there, and that's my expectation is that there would be more of that as we go through 2018.
Tax reform could change the sentiment among those making investment decisions from optimism to confidence and become the boost the U.S. economy needs to drive growth higher.The U.S. consumer should also benefit as higher take-home pay could drive either increased discretionary spending or the acceleration of payment of existing debt, each a potential positive outcome from the reduction in tax rates.
In all, tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward.With that, John will go through the presentation and then we'll be happy to answer your questions.
These results include a combined net benefit of roughly $0.08 per share from discrete items that resulted in a lower than expected tax rate as well as a one-time loss in discontinued operations.Excluding these items, our normalized EPS was $1.20 in the fourth quarter.
However, the dollar impact should moderate going forward.Turning now to each business, Slide 6 shows the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars.Net income grew 8% in the fourth quarter as growth in operating margin outpaced the higher cost of credit.
We continued to see positive momentum in Citigold with continued growth in both households and balances with improving penetration of investment products.Turning to branded cards, revenues of $2.2 billion increased slightly from last year.Client engagement remained strong, with average loans growing by 6% and purchase sales up 10% year over year.
The growth in promotional rate balances reflects a strong response to our offers, generating growth in both spending and borrowing activity from new accounts during the promotional period.We continue to be confident in our acquisition strategy and believe the investments we're making today will generate revenue growth as these balances mature.
Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 2% driven by higher average loans.Total expenses for North America consumer were flat to last year, as higher volume-related expenses and investments were offset by efficiency savings.
On a full-year basis, Asia consumer revenues grew by 5% in 2017 and 4% excluding gains.In total, operating expenses grew 5% in the fourth quarter as investment spending and volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings.Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail by region.
The sequential increase in the NCL rate reflected an episodic commercial charge-off while delinquencies continued to improve.Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 10, revenues of $8.1 billion declined 1% from last year as continued strong momentum in banking and securities services was offset by a decline in markets revenues.
Excluding this item, equities revenues declined by 4% from last year, reflecting lower activity in corporate equity derivatives while investor-client engagement remained strong.
And in equities we made solid progress with our target investor clients, improving wallet share and growing client balances in line with our investment plans.Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate Other.Revenues of $746 million declined 13% from last year, driven by the wind-down of legacy assets.
And trading-related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising-rate environment.On Slide 13 we show our key capital metrics.In the fourth quarter our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12.3%, driven by $6.3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends as well as the estimated $6 billion reduction in CET1 capital due to tax reform which, as I noted earlier, had a roughly 40-basis-point impact.
In terms of earnings power, the macro backdrop has only gotten stronger, with all major global markets having returned to growth and the U.S. poised to benefit from a more competitive tax regime.Higher GDP growth or additional U.S. interest rate hikes beyond the one we have embedded in this year's plan would provide a tailwind for us.
In the U.S., while branded cards has gotten off to a slow start, likely delaying growth in that business until 2019, we showed good traction with our Citigold wealth-management investment, and retail services is growing at slightly above our medium-term outlook.
And you mentioned overall even with U.S. card being a little light, your overall consumer revenue trajectory feels good relative to the Investor Day targets?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah if you think about it, what this means is we put up, I think, at Investor Day a compound annual growth rate for U.S.- branded cards of the 3 1/2-year period was going to be 3%.
Maybe you could have piecemeal restructurings or maybe you could still sell off some appreciated assets or do something a little bit faster.Again, even though things are moving in the right direction, maybe you can get there sooner.Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYea and, as I said, we're always open and we're always looking at things and certainly tax reform causes us to take a look but, again, when you look at some of the things you called out, treasury and trade solutions growing 9% in the quarter, 7% in the year, Mexico growing at 6%, those are big upscale businesses that are growing as we would like to grow them at a multiple of GDP but what we don't want to do is fall into the trap of then saying, ""Let's accelerate that faster"" and then start taking outsized growth in the form of balance sheet or other types of risks where we end up stumbling along the way.

citicorp,q1,2018,"And, we remain on track to deliver on the targets we announced at Investor Day.Our earnings per share were 24% higher than one year ago as a result of strong business performance, a lower tax rate, and a continued reduction in shares outstanding as we execute our capital return plans.
While fixed income revenues were lower than a year ago, driven by less investor activity, our equities business saw its best quarter in many years, giving us confidence that our investments are delivering results.
Starting on Slide 3, net income of $4.6 billion in the first quarter grew 13% from last year as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate.
EPS grew 24%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.Revenues of $18.9 billion grew 3% from the prior year, reflecting 7% aggregate growth in our consumer and institutional businesses, offset by lower revenues in corp/other as we continued to wind down legacy assets.
Our return on assets was 98 basis points for the quarter, and RoTCE improved to 11.4%.In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 6% year-over-year to $673 billion, as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in corp/other.
And, global cards delivered 3% revenue growth, excluding Hilton, driven by continued growth in loans and purchase sales in every region.Slide 5 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail.
We continue to generate growth in total interest earning balances this quarter, up about 6% year-over-year, excluding Hilton, as recent vintages continue to mature as expected, partially offset by the runoff of non-core balances.Excluding the impact of additional partnership terms that went into effect in January, we delivered roughly 2% underlying revenue growth in our US branded cards business this quarter, consistent with our full year 2018 outlook.Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 2% driven by higher average loans.
We continued to drive transaction volumes to lower cost channels, and digital engagement remains strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users, including 25% growth among mobile users versus last year.Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by 9% year-over-year and we built roughly $119 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning.
And corporate lending revenues of $521 million were up 19%, reflecting loan growth as well as lower hedging costs.Total markets and securities services revenues of $5 billion grew 3% from last year.
However, this was more than offset by lower investor client activity and a less favorable environment in G10 rates and spread products, in particular in March.Equities revenues were up 38%, with growth across all products as volatility trended higher and we saw continued momentum with investor clients, in line with our investment strategy.
This is an improvement from our prior outlook for quarterly losses in the range of $250-300 million based on somewhat higher treasury revenues given the higher rate environment as well as the lower expenses.Slide 10 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends, split by core accrual revenue, trading-related revenue, and the contribution from our legacy assets in corp/other.
Our core accrual net interest margin improved by eight basis points to 354 basis points, driven by the rate increase, loan growth, and lower average cash balances as we use liquidity to fund higher yielding assets.
On a full year basis, we now expect core accrual net interest revenue to grow by over $2.7 billion in 2018 as we vetted the impact of the recent March rate hike to our original outlook, which had called for $2.5 billion of growth, assuming only one fed rate increase in June.Legacy asset related net interest revenues should continue to decline by about $500 million this year as we wind down that portfolio.
Our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12.1% this quarter due to an increase in RWA, driven by loan growth and client activity, as well as $3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, partially offset by net income.
Our tangible book value per share, increased to $61.00.In summary, we made good progress toward our longer-term goal this quarter, with solid revenue growth, positive operating leverage, and a significant improvement in net income and returns.
Second, incentive related comp tends to be a little bit more heavily weighted to the front half of the year, and that's consistent with historic revenue trends in markets.Finally, we're taking the opportunity today to invest in the franchise, both to continue topline momentum as well as to [audio breaks up] counter significant efficiency savings that we've outlined for you at Investor Day. But, altogether, the second half expense profile should set us up well for achieving larger improvements in our efficiency ratio, both in the second half of this year and then into 2019 and into 2020.John McDonald -- Sanford C.
So, just a lot of good overall volumes coming out of Asia.Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche BankConceptually, how much of the franchise -- when we look at the East Asia -- revenues are kind of global corporates doing business versus maybe a notch below, like more local companies?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerMost of our book is focused on serving the needs of the large multinationals.
We can maybe take an educated guess, but if there is any help you can give us in trying to think through how the portfolio is sized today and how much you think you'll end up with in terms of paying balances next year and beyond.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerWe've never talked specifics about the exact dollar amount of promotional balances that we've built up.
Or, are there other factors that we need to consider?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerWe've told you the core accrual net interest revenue should grow $2.7 billion this year.
It's something that we hear from investors quite often, just given that your margins are well above some of your US retail bank peers, whether you expect to see meaningful convergence there and how should we think about the timing?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I don't want to get into guidance for individual product lines within a business.
How much can you say was due to market share gains versus just a better interest rate environment for you guys?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerI don't want to split the revenue growth.
You can pretty quickly run the math between the cost of an analogue phone call versus a digital engagement.When you go on and look at our apps, in terms of your ability to check your balances, to move monies, to make payments, those are three big drivers in what John referenced before, what we laid out on Investor Day around this $1.5 billion of efficiency we think we can get out of our consumer business.
Total revenues of $8.4 billion grew 6% year-over-year, and were up 4% excluding the impact of the Hilton portfolio sale, which resulted in a gain this quarter, partially offset by the loss of operating revenues for a net benefit of about $120 million in our US branded cards business.From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the first quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs, even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 8%, driven by continued growth in deposit margins, growth in investments and loans, and increased commercial banking activity.Average deposits declined 2% year-over-year, including the impact of lower mortgage escrow deposits.
New features will begin to roll out toward the end of the second quarter, followed by a promotional campaign beginning in the third quarter.Turning to branded cards, revenues were roughly flat from last year, excluding the previously mentioned impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio.
And, card revenues grew 13% on continued growth in purchase sales and full rate revolving loans as well as a favorable prior period comparison.Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 7% year-over-year in the first quarter, and were up 6% excluding the benefit of a modest one-time gain.
Revenues of $9.8 billion increased 6% from last year, driven by continued momentum in our accrual businesses as well as a very strong performance in equities this quarter.
Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 10% from last year, generally in line with the overall market and reflecting the timing of episodic deal activity.
Private bank revenues of $904 million grew 21% year-over-year, driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits, as well as improved deposit spreads.
Finally, in securities services, revenues were up 16% driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue.Total operating expenses of $5.5 billion increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of FX translation as well as a higher level of investment spending.
Core accrual net interest revenues grew by $750 million, but this was largely offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the anticipated wind down of legacy assets.On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew slightly, reflecting the December rate hike as well as loan growth, partially offset by the impact of the lower day count.
And, trading related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we saw in the first quarter.On slide 11, we show our key capital metrics.
Looking to the second quarter for total Citigroup, we expect topline growth to continue broadly in line with the pace we set this quarter, at around 3% plus or minus with stronger growth in our operating businesses being offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets.Operating efficiency should again show progress against the prior year period with more significant improvement to come in the second half of the year.
And the tax rate should be closer to 25%.Turning to the businesses in more detail, in consumer we expect continued revenue growth in US retail banking, retail services, Mexico, and Asia.
And, we expect continued revenue growth in our accrual businesses, TTS, corporate lending, private bank, and security services as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network.In addition, we're looking forward to receiving our CCAR results late in the second quarter.
So, think in terms of investment spending being a bit more front end loaded in 2018 and the resulting efficiency benefits then begin to ramp up in the second half of the year.So, when you get growth in the core businesses, we'll certainly have some volume related expenses growing.
Can you elaborate on the revenue strength there in terms of some of the products and what drove that?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerWe saw a lot of good activity coming out of Asia in this quarter.
How much of that is outside volatility this quarter, or do you really think there's some sustainability in that growth?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerI think it's a combination of both.
I think we feel good about the progresses and some of the stickiness that comes with that.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
So, you're not giving us the total balance of the promotional balances -- I'll take it if you could give it to us -- but, what else can you have us look to to be reassured that this strategy is going to pay off for shareholders?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYou're going to see -- we talk about some of the revenue impacts in '18 holding the overall business revenues flat.
But then, you should start to see -- beginning in the third quarter -- that percentage increase and that should give you a fairly good view as to what the future profitability of the business is.If you look at that now -- if you look year-over-year -- even with that percentage declining, we're still getting growth in net interest revenue in US branded cards ex-Hilton.
In the equity side, there's a buildout, but just generally, what are the puts and takes around the businesses?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerAs far as from an equities point of view, we certainly feel really good about the business that we're building in equities.
On LIBOR and the three-month/one-month basis differential that happened this quarter, how did that impact you guys in the NIM?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerVery little.
It's interesting to look at, but it didn't really impact us at all.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan StanleyAnd on trading, same thing?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, it's part of the conversations that you have with clients.
No.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan StanleyWhen I look at the core accrual NIM, the one on Page 10, the 354 this quarter, we can build off of that for the rest of the year, given the forward curve is looking for another couple of rate hikes?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
Thanks.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerWe continue to see credit performing very, very well, whether it be in the North America business, Mexico, or in Asia when it comes to consumer.

citicorp,q2,2018,"Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstance.Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Form 10-K.
While fixed income was in line with what we forecasted, our equities business had another strong quarter, up 19% from the year before and our accrual businesses continued to show strong growth across-the-board, especially treasury and trade solutions, security services, corporate lending, and the private bank.Investment banking revenue delivered another solid quarter with good growth in advisory and equity underwriting.
Earlier I mentioned, equities for last quarter we ranked sixth, just outside of our top five target.In consumer, our wealth management capabilities have been enhanced both through branch-based and digital outreach, and we significantly increased the amount of Citigold households here in the U.S. Clearly, U.S. branded cards faced headwinds, but we're seeing underlying momentum that gives us confidence in growth going forward.On the second priority, we continue to drive our digital transformation and invest for growth while self-funding these investment It's through efficiency savings.
EPS grew 27%, including the impact of an 8% reduction and average diluted shares outstanding.Revenues of $18.5 billion grew 2% from the prior year, driven by higher net interest revenues, and expenses were flat as higher volume-related expenses and investments will fully offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets.
Now, before we go into the second quarter in more detail, let me build on some of the comments Mike made earlier on our progress since Investor Day on slide four.We remain committed to improving our ROTCE through a combination of client-led revenue growth, expense discipline, and significant capital return.
Fixed income markets have been challenging, but we've offset this pressure with solid double-digit revenue growth in our accrual businesses: TTS, corporate lending, private bank, and security services.
Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 1% driven by higher average loans.This growth rate is likely to accelerate over the next few quarters, reflecting the recent acquisition of the L.L.Bean card portfolio, which added one $1.5 billion of high-quality receivables at quarter-end.
On slide seven, we show results for international consumer banking, in constant dollars.Second-quarter revenues of $3.2 billion versus 6% with contribution from both regions.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 11%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads, with solid growth across both net interest and fee income.Investment banking revenues of $1.4 billion, were down 7% from last year, as growth in M&A and equity underwriting was more than offset by a very strong prior year comparison in debt underwriting.
Corporate lending revenues of $589 million were up 22%, reflecting loan growth, as well as lower hedging costs.Total markets and security services revenues of 4.5 billion were down 1% from last year.
Total operating expenses of 5.5 billion increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher compensation costs and an increase in business volumes along with higher levels of investment spending partially offset by productivity savings.
This is a further improvement from our prior outlook based on higher treasury revenues given the higher rate environment as well as continued lower infrastructure expenses.Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends.
Trading-related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we saw in the first and second quarters.
How can you frame it for us to feel more comfortable that these businesses are pretty sustainable in somebody's headwinds?Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive Officer -- Citi Jim, first I would say that when we look at the trade rhetoric, it certainly introduced volatility but we haven't yet really started to see any significant changes in behavior.
So, can you walk us through just how U.S. rate curves versus non-U.S. rate curves are affecting how you're looking at deposit growth and what you're paying in different markets and is this the type of improvement that we should start seeing in terms of incremental betas from here?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi No. I'd break it down into two distinct categories, Ken. Where we see a real difference so far is in U.S. retail sensitivity and those Betas that we've actually realized to date have lagged our estimates.
There's a lot of curves for us to watch, you guys watch them all the time, but it seems like there's probably hasn't been that much change lately.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi No, not really.Ken Usdin -- Analyst -- Jeferries Okay.
So just, if you can give us your thoughts on how the capital planning process is evolving.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Yeah.
We're on track to bring our efficiency ratio down to roughly 57% with a return on assets above 90 basis points.With that, John will go through the presentation and then we'd be happy to take your questions, John?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Thanks a lot, Mike, and good morning everyone.
net income of $4.5 billion in the second quarter grew 16% from last year as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs, and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate.
GCB and ICG loans grew by $40 billion in total, with contribution from every region in consumer, as well as TTS, the Private Bank, and traditional corporate lending.Now, looking at the first half of 2018, we generated modest revenue growth and positive operating leverage with roughly 90 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio.
We've ramped up investments across the franchise to support this client lead growth.But over the past year, we've been able to fully offset this additional spend and volume-driven growth through efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, resulting in flat expenses in total.
Global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the second quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint.
So together, the Visa B gain and the repricing actions, are neutral to revenues in 2018.In total, we continue to expect branded card revenues, excluding built-in, to be roughly flat this year on a reported basis with around 2% underlying growth, driven by: continued strong client engagement, loan growth, and improved mix.
Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by eight 8% year-over-year, and we built roughly $117 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning.Our NCL rate in U.S. brands and cards was 304 basis points, in line with an NCL rate in the range of 3% for 2018.
Card revenues grew 9% on continued growth in purchase sales and full-rate revolving loans.Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 2% year-over-year in the second quarter, and were up 4% excluding the benefit of a modest one-time gain in the prior year.
Excluding the onetime gain last year, card revenues also grew 4% on continued growth in loans and purchase sales.In total, operating expenses were up 4% in the second quarter, as investment spending in volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Private bank revenues of $848 million grew 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in clients, loans, and investments, as well as improved deposit spreads.
As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.7 billion this quarter grew roughly 4% from last year, as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue, as well as the wind down of legacy assets in corp other.
Expenses should continue to decline sequentially in both the third and fourth quarters.This should keep us on pace to again deliver roughly a 100 basis points of efficiency improvement, similar to what we achieved in the first-half of the year.
It sounds like that's going to accelerate next year to kind of a two 200-basis- point improvement pace, starting next year, I guess.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi I would put it this way, John.
But, yeah, it will be 400-basis-points of improvement over the next two years and we will get to a low 50's operating efficiency in 2020.John McDonald -- Analyst -- Bernstein Got you.
Is at a pace that you can maintain going forward or some factors that we should keep in mind that were special this quarter?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Well there, big guy, all right.
But again, over the next two and a half years [inaudible] at or close to that 10% CAGR that we put out at Investor Day.John McDonald -- Analyst -- Bernstein Got it, thank you.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Okay.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with The Buckingham Research.Jim Mitchell -- Analyst -- The Buckingham Research Hey, good morning.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Hey, Jim.Jim Mitchell -- Analyst -- The Buckingham Research Maybe just a follow-up on the growth outside the U.S., it's obviously been ticking up.
But I think we would look at a combination of both: revenue growth investments and continued efficiency.
So we haven't made any decisions yet, but I think the important thing from an investor point of view is the understanding that the $2.5 billion is going to be higher.Jim Mitchell -- Analyst -- The Buckingham Research Right.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi We're not struggling to get to the $2.5 billion.Jim Mitchell -- Analyst -- The Buckingham Research Right.
Thanks.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi All right.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with the Deutsche Bank.Matt O'Connor -- Analyst -- Deutsche Bank Hi.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Hey, Matt.Matt O'Connor -- Analyst -- Deutsche Bank On the efficiency, you talked about the full-year improvement in 2018 of about a 100 basis point.
But again, we do like what we're seeing right now in those underlying drivers, and it certainly has given us the confidence in the fact that this is a business that this year, flat revenues with a 2% underlying growth, then next year, we should be able to see something around maybe a 2% growth overall, even with the grow over that we've got to do with helping in the vis-à-vis gain.Matt O'Connor -- Analyst -- Deutsche Bank Okay.
A lot of times, the consensus estimates wind up having efficiency going a lot lower and then you say, ""Well, we have to invest more in Mexico or we have to invest more in credit card, we have to invest more in something else."" So, the big picture about investing versus harvesting and then the specifics, why can't you have more than a 100 basic points of efficiency saves this year?Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive Officer -- Citi Well, I'll start with the first part.
So, all of that is embedded in that, that's about half of it.Then the other half is somewhat split 50-50, 60-40 between the Consumer Business and Corporate Treasury, where we continue to benefit from the higher rates and then consumer, from the growth in volumes particularly some of the volumes we talked about in Asia, in Mexico and now with the growth of the full rate interest-earning balances in branded cards.So, all of that is embedded but it's, I don't want you to think that it was just a phenomenon that suddenly happened in the second quarter, it's actually two quarters in a row now of what I would call fairly good sequential growth in our net interest income.Betsy Graseck -- Analyst -- Morgan Stanley Okay.
Appreciate it thank you.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Not a problem, Gerard.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.Erika Najarian -- Analyst -- Bank of America Hi, I thought I help you get to the record number of card questions as well.
One, on the Corp/other you mentioned there's going to be 1-150 over the remainder of 2018, but is the expectation then that it kind of tracks lower from there, as anything improves from there as the legacy assets roll off into '19 and '20?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi I'm going to get to '19 and '20 when we're closer to the fall at the next thing.
I mean, what can you do to get Mexico back up toward the target?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi It was basically the revenue growth, Brian, is tracking slightly below target.
Is it just loan growth is weaker than expected, is it?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial Officer -- Citi Deposits, I would say.

citicorp,q3,2018,"In Asia, we saw some headwinds in our more market-sensitive investment products, but the remainder of the franchise showed consistent growth and in the US we're starting to see the impact of the L.L.Bean portfolio in retail services where revenue continued to grow.Branded cards had sequential revenue growth and given strong growth in interest-earning balances, we remain on course to achieve 2% underlying revenue growth for the year.
And this year, our results include a gain of roughly $250 million on the sale of our Mexico asset management business in consumer.In constant dollars, total revenues excluding these gains grew by 4% in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in our institutional franchise.
GCB and ICG loans grew by 6%, or $37 billion in total, with contributions from every region in consumer, as well as TTS, the private bank, and traditional corporate lending.Looking at year-to-date results on Slide 4, you can see aggregate revenues in our consumer and institutional businesses have grown 4% this year, excluding the previously mentioned gains.
On an underlying basis, institutional revenues have grown 4%, in-line with our medium-term expectations, driven by our accrual businesses in treasury and trade solutions, securities services, lending, and the private bank.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 1% in the third quarter, a slower pace than we saw in the first-half of the year, largely reflecting lower episodic transaction activity in commercial banking, as well as increasing rate sensitivity.
In aggregate, deposits and assets under management grew slightly year-over-year, as strong growth in Citigold households and balances more than offset other outflows.Turning to branded cards, revenues were down 3% from last year, including the impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio, as well as previously mentioned partnership terms that went into effect earlier this year.
We expect the NIR percentage to continue to improve in the fourth quarter, resulting in year-over-year spread expansion that should continue into 2019.For the full-year, we continue to expect reported revenues in branded cards to be roughly flat, however, we remain on-track to achieve 2% underlying growth.
In Latin America, excluding the gain, total consumer revenues grew 8% driven by continued volume growth across commercial, mortgage, and card loans, as well as deposits.Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the third quarter, as continued growth in deposit, lending, and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues given a weaker market sentiment.
Over the last 12 months, Asia consumer revenues grew 4%, in-line with our medium-term expectations, driven by 5% growth in revenues, excluding investment products.
The sequential increase in the NCL rate in Latin America reflected an episodic commercial charge-off that was fully offset by a related loan loss reserve release, and therefore neutral to cost of credit.Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 9, excluding the impact of a prior year gain, revenues of $9.2 billion increased 4% in the third quarter and were also up 4% on a year-to-date basis with strength in both banking and markets.
On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew approximately $270 million, reflecting the benefit of higher rates, as well as loan growth, along with the impact of one additional day in the quarter.
However, core accrual net interest margin remained flat on a sequential basis, as the benefits of higher rates and loan growth were offset by higher average cash balances during the quarter.Year-to-date, core accrual revenue grew by over $2.7 billion year-over-year and we expect to see additional growth in the fourth quarter that's roughly in-line with the $970 million we saw this quarter.
However, as a reminder, on a full-year basis, we expect this increase to be partially offset by a roughly $500 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy asset wind-down portfolio in Corporate Other.
And we expect continued revenue growth in Asia and Mexico.Cost of credit should remain fairly stable, quarter-over-quarter and we remain on-track to achieve roughly 100 basis points of efficiency improvement this year.
And I guess, if we look out in that plan, is it fair that you expect that widening of the operating leverage to be partly driven by stronger revenues and partly by slower expense growth as we look out?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, John, I think we're consistent with what we laid out at Investor Day last year.
All of that is really what's going to fuel that revenue growth that you're going to see in 2019 and then beyond.John McDonald -- Bernstein -- AnalystThank you.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerAll right.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystHey, good morning, John.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerHi Jim.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystMaybe just following up on John's prior question on cards, as you noted, the net interest or the NIR percentage grew 23 bps to 8.51.
How do we think about that longer-term potential revenue yield in the card business?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I don't think that we're right in the position now, Jim, to give you a long-term goal on net interest percentage.
But again, constructively, when you look at what's going on in terms of AUM, we continue to build AUM and provided this isn't some long, prolonged period of extraordinarily heightened volatility, we'd expect those wealth management revenues to recover and therefore putting us on track for that 4%.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, you know, Glenn, we actually put a slide in the back of the earnings deck, Slide 20 just to sort of make some of the points that Mike is just making.
One is just on how the steepening of the yield curve is helping you out, and in particular, the European yield curve because I think there is a little more exposure there than most banks that I cover, so I wanted to get an understanding from you as to how it's impacting your forward look.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYou know, Betsy, we really are still much more exposed to movement on the short end on the curve.
Actual results, and capital, and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the Risk Factor Section of our 2017 Form 10K.With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you Susan, and good morning everyone.
Fixed income and equities were up 7% in total and, as in the past, our accrual businesses, TTS security services, corporate lending, and the private bank all showed strong year-over-year growth.Investment banking was down versus last year, as continued growth in M&A was more than offset by slower underwriting activity across the industry, but client dialogues remain solid and we feel good about the pipeline and upcoming transactions.During the quarter, we also made some changes to make certain our structure is completely aligned with our strategic goals.
His experience in Asia, where we operate a client-centric franchise with strong digital adoption, will help us bring North America to where it needs to be as we look to leverage both our brand and our scale and credit cards to drive deeper client relationships nationwide.In ICG, we're combining corporate and investment banking with capital markets origination.
Finally, in US retail, a drag from lower US mortgage revenues, which should abate going forward, as well as rising deposit sensitivity.Despite these headwinds, we've made good progress on expenses, bringing our year-to-date efficiency ratio down to 57.3%.
Average deposits declined 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by a reduction in money market balances, as clients put more money to work in investments.Assets under management grew 9% to $64 billion.
This underlying growth should accelerate and translate into reported growth in 2019, even considering the Hilton and vis-à-vis gains we took earlier this year.Finally, retail services of $1.7 billion grew 2%, driven by organic loan growth, as well as the full quarter benefit of the recent acquisition of the L.L.Bean card portfolio, partially offset by higher partner payments.Total expenses for North American consumer were up 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of investments versus the prior period.
On a sequential basis, expenses were roughly flat and should remain stable into the fourth quarter.Turning to credit, total credit costs were down 20% year-over-year, primarily due to a lower reserve bill in both branded cards and retail services relative to last year.
While investment product revenues are more market-sensitive and can be variable quarter-to-quarter, we've seen growth over time consistent with our growth in clients and assets under management and we are continuing to increase the proportion of more stable, accrual-type investment revenues as our business in Asia today is more sensitive to upfront transaction fees than in other regions.In total, operating expenses were up 4% in the third quarter, as investment spending and volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 4% as reported and 8% in constant dollars, reflecting continue growth in transaction volumes, loans, and deposits.Investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 8% from last year, as growth in M&A was more than offset by a decline in underwriting fees, reflecting lower market activity.
Corporate lending revenues of $563 million were up 11%, reflecting loan growth along with lower hedging costs.Total markets and securities services revenues of $4.5 billion were up 8%, excluding the gain last year.
Finally, in security services, revenues were up 11% as reported and 15% in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue.Total operating expenses of $5.2 billion increased 1% year-over-year as higher compensation costs, investments, and an increase in business volumes were partially offset by efficiency savings.
As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.8 billion this quarter grew roughly 5% from last year, as growth in core accrual, net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corp.
Are we getting to the point where the incremental savings will start being reflected in the core businesses as we look out?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYou'll see, as we said, consumer expenses staying stable next quarter.
So will you be getting additional disclosure as it relates to the North American consumer, whether it's digital banking or slice and dicing a few different ways for us externally.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerMike, when you say, ""Additional disclosure,"" do you mean other than the breakouts that we give you right now as far as branded cards, retail services, and retail bank and then adding them all up together to be the North America region?Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystOr it could relate to more digital banking disclosure, how you're doing with products and customers, or -- you have a lot more capability internally given what you've done with Project Rainbow.
Or would you be more open to maybe buying a branch network than you've been in the past?Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerI would say it's more likely than not to build organically.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay, and then if I could just squeeze in a completely separate question, the charge-offs in Latin America picked up a bit both quarterly and year-over-year, but the delinquencies actually went down.
Can you just talk us through if there was any notable change in underlying?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerNo, the pick-up in net credit losses in Latin America really stemmed from one commercial credit that we took to write-off this quarter, but we had already fully reserved for it.
Just wondered the thinking around that.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerThe way that the math works with some of the models, yes, there are some portfolios where, upon the adoption of CECL we'd actually have too much loan loss reserve.
",15.85,0.33926862
citicorp,q4,2018,"In addition, we grew loans and deposits in constant dollars by 4% and 7%, respectively, improved our return on assets to 93 basis points and managed our effective tax rate down to the 23% range, a little better than we had forecast.
And as a matter of fact, we've now had five straight years of consecutive growth in TTS and are confident that we can continue with that momentum.In Global Consumer Banking, in the U.S., we saw 4% underlying growth in branded cards and 6% revenue growth in retail services this quarter, and retail banking grew 5% ex mortgages.
As I mentioned before, we have levers we can pull if revenues come in lower, but we're very cognizant of the need to invest for the long term so that we can serve our clients with distinction.One thing before we go to Q&A.
And finally, cost of credit was $129 million this quarter, reflecting a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio.Looking at the full year, excluding the previously mentioned gain of roughly $580 million in 2017, both revenues and expenses grew by 3% in 2018.
And in equities, we made solid progress with revenues up 19% for the full year.The combined strong performance in these businesses help to offset weakness in Investment Banking and Fixed Income, down 7% and 6%, respectively, on a full-year basis.
We also recognize that we're in an uncertain macro environment where the market is beginning to discount future growth and this may create a more volatile operating environment as we saw in the fourth quarter, but we're continuing to manage the franchise responsibly and we're committed to steady, sustainable improvement in both our efficiency and returns.
And while our U.S. branded cards franchise generated only 1% growth for the full year, we saw 3% underlying growth in that franchise in 2018 with momentum as we exited the fourth quarter.That's a business with nearly $9 billion of annual revenues, where we are now realizing the benefits of our investments over the past 3 years.
Of course, it's more difficult to predict the operating environment in areas like trading and investment banking, but we continued to show good progress in M&A and equity this year, and our global FX business proved to be resilient in a challenging market.
And what we've shown here is that year over year for the past number of quarters, we've been able to bring that operating efficiency down.But more importantly to your question around expense ranges we can manage to, you can look at the fourth quarter of 2018 and see we ran at about $41.8 billion.
Or is -- I know that was sort of your prior expectations, is that still the expectation in '19 for the card losses?Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. What we've said, the medium-term expectations will be that branded cards would operate in that range of 3% to 3.25% and retail services in the 5% to 5.25%.
Is that kind of how you're thinking about branded card revenues for '19?Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerYes. I mean, if you -- the branded cards, as John mentioned, fourth quarter roughly 3% underlying.
We have the shutdown in the U.S. Just kind of any real-time updates in terms of macro traditions that you're seeing.Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. And I think the third piece is, that adds to that volatility, is things such as trade, kind of the on, off-again momentum of trade negotiations, obviously, affecting two of the biggest economies in the world.
And so again, when you think about things that are top of list, clearly, the more broad investment in terms of digital.We talked about some of those cost saves that have begun to come through, roughly the 200 this year, manifesting itself in 500 to 600 incremental in each of the next two years, a lot of that savings is dependent upon the continued investment in terms of the switch from analog to digital, and in particular in parts of our consumer business kind of coming from behind and kind of getting cards back on track, the empty calories of carding marketing investment in terms of our platforms there.
But if and when appropriate, we're going to pull the levers we need to pull.Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerMike, I'm not sure we mentioned TTS in particular as well in addition to those businesses.
The sort of tone at the top says, ""Hey, we've made a lot of progress, but we still have a long way to go."" We don't know we get that sense or I don't personally always get that sense, that this is a firm that needs to better optimize, notwithstanding how far you've come.Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerMike, I think you've got to go back and put in a little bit of context of history, right.
And then, Mark, what's the difference in your approach versus John in how you're going to look at things and maybe nuanced changes?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerMike, when you look at -- actually, the answer to both the question you asked to Mike and to me, when we look at the efficiency by business, most of the work still has to get done in the consumer business.
But that's -- it's in the overall efficiency in the consumer business where we still have some work to do.I'll turn it over to Mark.Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerYes. I guess I'd say, one, I'd like to just echo the point that we are intensely focused on this.
That involves what we can do to continue to realize the benefits and the momentum we're seeing in the strong parts of the franchise, many of which both Mike and John have gone through.It involves us delivering on the savings from productivity, the $500 million to $600 million that largely should offset the volume and compensation growth that we see in revenue growth going into '19.
And certainly, you conveyed a very positive tone on your ability to hit that 3% target.Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerYes. One, you're spot on in terms of NII, in that we feel like our ability to deliver on the $2 billion or so or similar performance to what we saw in 2018.
Obviously, as we go forward, we'll continue to refine that, but I think we're quite comfortable with the 11.5% today.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerI think the only thing I'd add to Mike's comment is that 11.5% that we laid out there, that was never intended to be a bright-line limit.
And maybe what's your expectation in terms of where that could bottom as a percentage of total deposits?John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerI'm not going to give you the guidance as to where it could bottom.
So we think right now, we're in a fairly good balance, but we are still going to see a bit of a shift going forward from noninterest bearing into interest bearing.Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerJust keep in mind, our U.S. retail deposits are about $150 billion out of $1 trillion of total deposits we have.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystAll right.
So we think we're above that.And clearly, as we execute against the trajectory this year to 12%, obviously, clearly above that, and above 12%, 13%-plus and beyond.Marty Mosby -- Viking Sparks Management -- AnalystThanks.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Marty.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystHey, thanks.
We're already seeing that in the ICG.Just think about the net interest rate, the net interest revenue outlook that we just talked about and all of the growth now that is coming out of those businesses.
But at this point in time, I'd say that mix that we talked about then in terms of needing to close the gap on the consumer side and 100 basis points or so of improvement on the ICG side is still where we think things are heading.I guess the final point I'd make on that is, as you saw in the fourth quarter, where we see pressure in the business, i.e. And I know we'll get the VAR numbers in the 10-Q, 10-K, and so I assume we'll see some reflection of that there as well.
But I'm just wondering on the rate side and the volatility that existed in rates.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerRate -- when you take a look at the decline in FICC revenues, most of it was centered in G10 rates, so that was a big driver of the year-over-year decline in FICC.
And how dependent is hitting those 2020 targets on revenue growth alone?Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerSo when you look at that -- as we described it at Investor Day, Brian, we talked about a number of levers, right, that it was the combination of single-digit revenue growth, good expense discipline, reasonable cost of credit and obviously, significant capital return.
Because you give us the last 12 months, but it's hard to get a real sense of what the revenues actually were -- did year on year without the actual number for the quarter.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Vivek, I don't have that number in front of me.
And we've been pretty consistent with positive operating leverage coming out of Mexico in particular, and we would expect to have positive operating leverage in Mexico in 2019 as well.So it's a one quarter.Vivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- AnalystBut if I look at, John, full-year '18 and ex the gain on the sale of the asset management business, it was essentially revenue growth and expense for the -- given your rounded numbers in constant dollars, are essentially the same.
Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com; after which, we'll be happy to take questions.Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
We finished the year with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 11.9%, up from 11.7% in the third quarter as risk-weighted assets declined.We'll be making our CCAR submission in the spring and believe we've got that capacity to reach our three-year capital return target of $60 billion.
Now looking at our results on this basis, net income of $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter grew 14% from last year driven by a reduction on expenses, lower cost of credit and a lower effective tax rate, and EPS grew 26% including the impact of an 8% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.
Revenues of $17.1 billion declined 2% from the prior year, primarily reflecting lower Fixed Income Markets revenues as well as of the wind down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.
Excluding these items, consumer revenues grew 3% in constant dollars, slightly below our medium-term goal.This is primarily driven by the near-term impact of weaker market sentiment on our Asia wealth management revenues; the impact of partnership terms that came into effect in 2018 in U.S. branded cards, which we have now lapped as we go into 2019; and finally, in U.S. retail, a drag from lower U.S. mortgage revenues, which should abate going forward as well as rising deposit sensitivity.Institutional revenues also grew 3% as strength in our accrual businesses in Treasury and Trade Solutions, Securities Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank was partially offset by weakness in Fixed Income as well as softness in equity and debt underwriting.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 5% year over year in the fourth quarter, slightly better growth than we saw in the third quarter as deposit spreads stabilized in our commercial portfolio and we faced fewer headwinds from episodic transaction activity.Average deposits declined 1% year over year, primarily driven by the transfer of deposits into investments.
Average loans grew 3% versus last year, including 9% growth in interest-earning balances, as recent vintages continued to mature and we saw strong balance retention across our portfolio.This growth in percentage improved by over 30 basis points to nearly 880 basis points, a little better than we had anticipated for the fourth quarter.
As such, we expect to remain broadly around this level of spreads going forward, although we will see quarterly fluctuations and actual performance will depend on a number of factors, including our acquisition mix, the rate environment and our balance between proprietary and co-brand portfolios over time.
In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 5% or 7% excluding the ongoing impact of the sale of our asset management business in the third quarter.Card revenues grew 8% on continued strength in purchase sales and loan growth, while retail banking revenues grew 6%, excluding the impact of the asset management sale.
And excluding investment revenues, our underlying Asia consumer growth remains broadly in line with our medium-term expectations driven by growth in loans and deposits.Total average loan growth of 3% in Asia includes the impact of our continued repositioning away from lower-return mortgage assets.
In total, operating expenses were up 1% in the fourth quarter, as investment spending and volume-driven growth were largely offset by efficiency savings, and cost of credit declined 1% reflecting a modest reserve release in Latin America this quarter.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8.Revenues of $8.2 billion were down 1% in the fourth quarter, as strength in our accrual businesses as well as revenue growth in M&A and equity markets were more than offset by weakness in fixed income.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 7% as reported and 11% in constant dollars, reflecting continued growth in transaction volumes and deposits as well as improved spreads.
Investment banking revenues of $1.3 billion were down 1% from last year, as strong M&A performance was more than offset by a decline in underwriting, reflecting lower market activity.Private Bank revenues of $797 million grew 3% year over year, driven by growth in loans and investments as well as improved deposit spreads.
Fixed Income revenues of $1.9 billion declined 21% year over year due to a challenging trading environment during the quarter.At the Goldman conference in early December, I noted that while clients remained engaged, we did not see the level of transaction activity we had originally expected this quarter, in G10 rates in particular, as clients have largely stayed on the sidelines in an uncertain macro environment.
Equities revenues were up 18% mainly reflecting the impact of an episodic loss in the prior year.On an underlying basis, revenues were down slightly as strong client activity, particularly in derivatives, was offset by a challenging trading environment and lower client financing balances.
And in Fixed Income, if you look at our total G10 FX and local markets rates and currencies business, revenues were far more stable at roughly flat to last year as we benefited from steady corporate flow activity across our global network.Cost of credit was higher than the prior year given lower reserve releases, but credit quality remains solid with roughly 5 basis points of losses for the year.
Expenses were down 45%, also reflecting the wind down, as well as lower infrastructure costs.And pre-tax income was $44 million this quarter, better than our outlook, reflecting episodic gains in our investment portfolio as well as lower total expenses relative to our prior expectations.
As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.9 billion this quarter were roughly 8% for the last year in constant dollars, as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue as well as the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.Core accrual net interest revenue grew by $1.4 billion year over year, well above our prior expectations driven by the FDIC surcharge benefit, improved spreads in our U.S. branded cards business and balance sheet optimization as we deployed more cash into better yielding assets.
In the fourth quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 6% year over year to $63.79 driven by the lower share count and our CET1 capital ratio improved to 11.9% driven by a reduction in risk-weighted assets as we continued to prudently manage the balance sheet.
The largest of these is our Treasury and Trade Solutions franchise, which generated over $9 billion of revenues and posted its fifth consecutive year of growth in constant dollars.Our other accrual businesses in ITG across Securities Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank generated another $8 billion of revenues with good line of sight into 2019.
On the branded card, John, you mentioned feeling good about the momentum continuing on the NII front, which was very solid this quarter and better fees as you lap the partnership headwind.So what's a reasonable revenue growth aspiration for 2019 in this kind of economy?
I was wondering what your updated thoughts are there.Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerYes. That's still the target we're moving toward for branded cards and then now with tax reform.John McDonald -- Sanford C.
So kind of new tax rates maybe offsetting increased competition or stays about the same?Mark Mason -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerThere's probably a little bit of upside to that.John McDonald -- Sanford C.
And beyond that upfront impact, an acceleration of store closures would likely have an impact on the retail services revenues, perhaps resulting to -- in a flat top line result in total for '19 and '20 given the expected impact of new account acquisitions.Mike Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd Glenn, just specific to your question, in there, again we've talked about it before, but you've got a co-brand card here where 70% of the volume on that card is out of store, which is consistent with top of wallet.
And that was one of the things that led us then to talk about trading revenues overall being down slightly year over year because we didn't see that good engagement in G10 rates.With December, we saw basically that extreme volatility, given the overall lack of a view of where rates would finally bottom out, just impact every one of our businesses in fixed income.
I just thought maybe there was a balance between the liquidity and the rates coming down, getting some deals done in the particular fourth quarter.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerOverall, Marty, debt underwriting, it may have been a little bit better than people were fearing, but it still was not exactly what I would call a strong environment by any stretch of the imagination.
But we're certainly not looking at any sort of significant ramp-up in cost of credit over the next couple of years, other than as loan portfolios continue to grow and season, you're going to get some natural increase.But those loss rates, we feel pretty good about those loss rates.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystAnd as you think about the segments and the geographies for hitting these targets into 2020 or maybe the long term, I call that, like beyond 2020, I guess.
I know we talked through Sears earlier.John Gerspach -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. When you gave the updated guidance at the end of '18, you had said that 2020 was expected to be effectively lower than what it was in 2019, even though tax rate's down from 24% to less than 24%.

citicorp,q1,2019,"We had positive operating leverage and improved our efficiency for the 10th straight quarter, and we had strong growth in both loans and deposits in our core businesses.In our Global Consumer Bank, we had underlying revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region; excluding the Hilton gain last year, total revenues grew 4% on flat expenses and we grow our operating margin by 8% and credit costs remained broadly in line with our expectations, driving double-digit EBIT growth.In North America, we saw strong underlying growth of 5% in our Branded Cards portfolio and 3% growth in Retail Services.
We saw deposit growth in retail banking and introduced new products to our support branch-light, digital-heavy strategy in the US.In Mexico, we had 5% underlying growth and while Asia grew at a slower rate due to a very strong prior year investment revenues, loan and deposit growth remain solid.
While GDP growth does appear to be slowing somewhat, we still see good consumer and corporate engagement.We'll continue to focus on serving our clients and finding opportunities to deepen our relationships across our consumer and institutional businesses, and we remain committed executing our strategy and to meeting our financial targets.As you know, we pride ourselves on having a deep bench and last week we called on that depth when we selected new leadership who help drive our firm forward in light of Jamie Forese's retirement.
Revenues of $18.6 billion declined 2% from the prior year and were down 1% excluding the $150 million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio last year, primarily reflecting lower equity markets revenues and mark-to-market losses on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio, along with the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate Other.Expenses declined 3% year-over-year as continued investments in the franchise were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets, resulting in our 10th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage.
Excluding the previously mentioned gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses remained flat, resulting in positive operating leverage and an 8% improvement in operating margin, and pre-tax earnings grew 11%.Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail.
Excluding investment revenues, our underlying Asia consumer growth remains broadly in line with our medium-term expectations.In total, operating expenses were down 1% for the first quarter as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume-driven growth and cost of credit declined 4% reflecting a modest reserve release this quarter compared to a modest build in the prior year.Slide 7 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail.
Private Bank revenues of $880 million declined 3% versus a strong quarter in the prior year, reflecting lower managed investment revenues, as well as higher funding costs and corporate lending revenues of $569 million were up 9%, reflecting growth in volumes and spreads.Total Markets and Securities revenues of $4.7 billion declined 6% from last year.
Fixed income revenues of $3.5 billion grew 1% year-over-year as strength in rates and spread products was partially offset by weakness in FX given the low currency volatility seen this quarter while corporate client activity remained stable.
Equities revenues were down 24% versus a particularly strong quarter in the prior year, reflecting lower market volumes and client financing balances.And finally in Securities Services, revenues were flat on a reported basis, but up 5% in constant dollars driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue.
Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion declined 1% year-over-year as efficiency savings, more than offset investments and volume driven growth, and cost of credit was $21 million this quarter driven by portfolio growth partially offset by loan-specific reserve releases.Total non-accrual loans increased sequentially this quarter but the ratio of non-accrual to total corporate loans remained low at 41 basis points and the additions to non-accruals this quarter did not negatively impact our cost of credit, as these loans were covered by previously established reserves.Slide 9 shows the results for Corporate Other.
Thank you.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYou're welcome.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHi, thanks very much.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystSo I think both growth in the consumer side in Mexico and Asia are below where your goals were.
So you (Multiple Speakers)Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYou talk about (multiple speakers) which I think people have picked up on.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystYes, so there's a little bit on the revenue side and your building in a lot less normalization in terms of credit costs than maybe what most of us have.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerI kind of feel like we're looking at a normalized view of it.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystOkay, got it if I could change gears then on the Retail Banking earnings, income from continuing operations this quarter, I believe, was 80% -- in the $80 million something this quarter, far below what it -- far below what it's been in the recent past and I guess a couple of questions.
Understood thank you.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, good morning.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerHi, Betsy.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerHi, Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystI wanted to touch base on an announcement that you made at the end of March that had to do with Citi building out digital consumer payments platform and I know we talked earlier on the call about the issuer side, but I think this is more on the merchant side.
And then circling back up on CECL into your comments that you just made, do you guys think you'll give to us the investors by the end of the year some color on what the -- everyone has been very good in the day one reserve build which you just gave us or refine for us today, but any thoughts about what the day two the loan loss provision number could look like on a quarterly basis going forward versus what you're going to report in 2019 under the old methodology?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Thank you.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYour welcome.OperatorYour final question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC.Al Alevizakos -- HSBC -- AnalystHi, good morning.
Starting on Slide 3, net income of $4.7 billion in the first quarter grew 2% from last year, as a reduction in expenses and a lower tax rate more than offset lower revenues, as well as higher credit costs.
Since that time, we have optimized our mix of interest earning to non-interest earning balances while continuing to drive account growth, and we expect loan growth to revert to more recent levels starting in the second quarter.Finally, retail services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 3%, driven by organic loan growth as well as the impact of the L.L.Bean portfolio acquisition.
Importantly, we're managing expenses carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns as seen this quarter and our strong EBIT growth.Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the first quarter as growth in deposit, lending and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues.
And in Mexico, the NCL rate reflects continued seasoning in the cards portfolio, as well as the impact of lower overall volume growth.Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group, on Slide 8, revenues of $9.7 billion declined 2% in the first quarter as strength in TTS and Investment Banking was more than offset by weakness in equities, as well as the impact of $230 million of mark-to-market losses on loan hedges, as credit spreads tighten throughout the quarter.
In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.8 billion this quarter grew by roughly $860 million year-over-year, reflecting higher rates, loan growth and a favorable loan mix, as well as the absence of the FDIC surcharge.
And our NIM expanded by 1 basis point reflecting higher rates and improved loan mix.On a full year basis, we continue to expect to generate at least $2 billion of growth in net interest revenue year-over-year.
For the full year, we continue to expect modest revenue growth, flattish expenses and higher but manageable cost of credit combined with continued balance sheet and capital optimization to drive improved returns for our shareholders.Looking to the second quarter, we expect to return to year-over-year revenue growth.
I guess, is that 140 basis points more of what you're looking for this year in terms of efficiency better than you did last year and what are the key drivers of that?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So thank you, John, and good to talk to you.
Do you power through and grow the underlying franchise or do you cut back to manage profitability?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerI think that, Glenn, what we've talked about and I think what Mark pointed out in his remarks, is we've got the ability to manage the cost line there and to manage for both EBIT growth as well as returns.
And then when we think about your 2 billion plus for the year, well, I guess what scenario drives the pluses, is it just loan growth or is there some other aspects of the market that could help?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. I mean, it's largely going to be loan growth and the amount of volume we are able to capture there.
So we think that that will continue to play out, as I mentioned, we're seeing deposit growth there that's going to help on the revenue line and we expect that to continue as we execute against that strategy.
I don't think there's anything in particular in the way of expenses except what I would say is that for productivity that we've talked about is going to start -- it will continue to play out through the balance of the year and so that's going to help when you look at kind of the Retail Banking profitability in the outer quarters.
So combination of continued revenue growth, continued expense improvement on the heels of productivity saves should help drive improved performance there.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystWas there anything unusual in the line item this quarter, the $83 million of operating earnings, it's been running about $130 million to $160 million in recent quarters or is that just the tough quarter?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerNot that I can -- we talked about the investments that we've been making.
I mean those are the things that would be playing out through Q1 and again it is somewhat back loaded in terms of the productivity saves that start to play out in the balance of the year.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystOkay , got it.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerI guess the other thing I had mentioned is and I had mentioned this at a conference I did in March, which is that, as we came into the year and again on the heels of the fourth quarter where we saw material softness in revenue, we wanted to be very thoughtful about the 2019 plan and we did take an opportunity in Q1 to pull forward some of our restructuring decisions, if you will, reorganization decisions, and so while we don't break the item out, there's probably some repositioning dollars inside Q1 for retail banking in particular that is driving that $83 million that you see in the quarter.
So could you just talk through -- perhaps just more of a better aspiration on the revenue side of why you don't you expect flat year-over-year given the point you just made about having perhaps a little restructuring under there and then the better start already that you had in the first quarter of the year?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSo to be clear, we do expect to see revenue growth through the balance of the year and so that obviously will drive some expense dollars with that.
Thank you.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So our fixed income revenues grew 1% versus the prior year, and what we really saw was a normalization of rate in credit markets at the turn of the year coming out of the fourth quarter and the dislocation that was there.
",10.88,0.64269954
citicorp,q2,2019,"In the second quarter, while we saw pressure in underlying markets revenues, it was entirely offset by the Tradeweb gain, so non-interest revenues were flat to last year.Looking ahead to the second half of 2019, as a reminder, in Consumer, we will be comparing to the third quarter of 2018, when we had a $250 million gain on the sale of our Asset Management business in Mexico.
So just -- what are the things to think about, puts and takes for the second half that could get you over that 12% for the year?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, thank you.
The good news is that we have seen continued momentum in the Consumer franchise, particularly in branded cards as we've talked about over the past couple of quarters with very strong performance this quarter as well on the heels of us converting those promotional balances to more average interest earning balances, and we'd expect that revenue growth to continue through the balance of the year.You heard me mention the international franchises, which are growing to have continued growth in the balance of the year and where there is muted growth to have to offset that with expense management and therefore have EBIT growth, particularly in the case of Latin America.
And on the expense side, we talked to or I talked to really being on the high end of those productivity savings outweighing investments, and I would expect to certainly come in with that -- on the $600 million side of the range that we've talked to there.The big area where the uncertainty in the environment, you can pick the factor, whether it's the direct -- what's going on with rates and volatility around that or trade and tariff discussions, it plays out through the market-sensitive businesses.
It plays out through the trading that you see on fixed income and equities, it plays out through investment banking, it impacts corporate sentiment and those things, as you would imagine, are difficult to predict.We obviously feel good about the client dialog that we've had, but that's -- those are the factors that are a bit harder to manage.
Was there any frontloading of marketing or any other expense kind of frontloading or investment frontloading that happened...Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, I mean, when you look at the profitability, just in general, on the Consumer business, it does tend to skew toward the back half of the year because of things like marketing spend.
Are there offsets that we don't see and/or are some of those trends like the tail end of things that have been in motion and they actually get better over the next couple of quarters?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, so in terms of the net interest revenue, we're obviously at about $1.3 billion of net interest revenue with a strong Q1, about $450 million in Q2.
And as we look at that, we've obviously factored in, at this point, not only the shift that you've mentioned from non-interest bearing to interest bearing, but also the likelihood of a rate reduction based on the talk that is out there.And so as we look at it and we look at kind of the continued momentum on the card side and we look at the -- and the deposit growth that we're seeing, particularly in the TTS franchise with higher volumes, a growth of 10% or so, we feel pretty good about our ability to get to that 4% growth in NIR.
And then three, as we've been growing some of the US deposits that I mentioned earlier, some of that has been growth out of our markets, but with high -- so tide with high-yield saving account type product.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystSo would you expect that to continue to creep higher a little bit or start to stabilize?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerIt kind of depends on kind of what happens in the broader rate environment.
And the way we think about the return of capital or distribution of capital going forward is, largely as we get close to that 11.5%, which we expect to get close to toward the end of the year, will be around how much capital we generate, just opposed against how much we need to continue to grow.And so we certainly have the objective of continuing to return as much as makes good sense, given the growth opportunities for the franchise.
So we feel pretty good about that percentage albeit we started at a higher CET1 ratio years ago.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystAnd can you just remind us, as we think about the 11.5% target, what are some of the areas of clarity that you're looking for in terms of reevaluating that.
Like as you think about some of these moving pieces, do you think you'll have clarity before the next CCAR cycle that might motivate you to resubmit or is it more hoping to have clarity for the next cycle on these factors?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerIt's -- these things kind of take time to play out, I think as we've seen over the past couple of years.
But given that the $50 million impact from 25 -- per quarter from each 25 basis points to cut; presumably even if we do get one cut or two cuts, it seems like you're confident that you can get NII growth in the back end of the year versus the first half.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, I think the broader issue is the uncertainty that Mike and I have referenced, that's just out there.
Is there a reason why you're not doing that this time around?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. Just -- I mean, as we kind of exited Holdings and started to kind of wind down those legacy businesses, it became less of a significant variable as you look at these total revenues, it was probably 5% of the aggregate revenues in the first quarter, and so it just wasn't as -- it wasn't, on a constant dollar basis, just wasn't as meaningful, and so we move toward simplifying it with both the legacy break out as well as the trading NIR breakout.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystOkay.
In a tougher rate environment, can you right-size profitability or how much more difficult is it to right-size the profitability of your retail banking business, if the Fed continues to cut?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, I'd make -- I make two points.
We do see benefits from technology playing out in these -- in the expense line and in the productivity savings that I've referenced both in '19 and 2020 and likely beyond, and those things will help in getting us to the lower levels of operating efficiency that we've talked about achieving over time.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerMike, I think if you go to Page 21 in the deck, you can see we've put in there some different drivers and metrics.
We'll see how this year plays out, given all of the uncertainty referenced and will go into 2020 with the 13.5% remaining our target and with the -- with clarity on where we think we'll end up against it.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd Mike, the way I think about it simplistically is, we're going to do everything within our power to get to those numbers with the exception of two things.
Will there -- will we get conviction in terms of the trajectory of this lower rate environment and portfolios have to reposition, because I think today, they're not position where they need to be fully.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd again, to that point, just last week when there appear to be some signs of greater clarity on the move-in rates, the reduction in rates and the timing of that, the equity markets responded very, very favorably to that.
We have seen kind of broadly just good activity with our consumer retail clients, not just with the net deposits, but also retaining deposits as they shift into AUMs and so as clients start to make investments and so the flow levels have been very good, if you include both AUMs and the deposits.I would say we would expect continued growth in the deposits in the back half of the year.
Some of it is rate, yes, but it's a combination of all of those things and we expect continued growth.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystAnd then, I know you mentioned that the NIM came under a little bit of pressure as you had significant increase in deposit growth and the tie-in question here is, is there anything you need to see from these customers?
We are in front of that investment to stay competitive and we'll continue to do so.And I'll let Mike kind of comment on some of the other piece, as you mentioned.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerMark, I would just to -- going back to TTS for one second, Betsy, operating in a declining rate environment is nothing new.
Again we could very well see as Mike suggested, the market having to react to a rate reduction and certainty around the direction in a way that is favorable to trading businesses, but we've got to kind of wait and see how some of that plays out.Erika Najarian -- Bank of America -- AnalystOkay, thank you.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- AnalystYeah, morning.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerMorning.Brian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- AnalystSo, a quick question on branded cards.
But do you think that you'll be able to offset some of the impact as you're able to pull those deposit rates back now?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerI mean, look, we've seen, we talked a little bit about -- earlier about the betas and how they vary from the corporate clients and commercial clients to the retail consumer client base and I think there are other important factors as rates start to move in a downward direction.
Your target that is.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, as Mike kind of alluded to earlier, there are couple of factors that are involved in the CET1 ratio just taking that part of the question first, and obviously, we've had a management buffer that is included there of about 100 basis points.
How does it look at the end of the second quarter relative to the end of the first quarter?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerI guess, again on investment banking, kind of as you saw in the numbers, we ended down 10%, but better than what I talked about at Morgan Stanley.
And so, we kind of go into the balance of the year, feeling good, again, about that dialog but also recognizing our all these factors that we talked about influences the corporate sentiment and willingness to take action.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd George, you know, when I think of it, it's -- in some ways, it's -- the pipelines are fine.
In Asia, higher deposit revenues and a recovery in investment revenues drove growth in the region.In our Institutional Clients Group, we delivered continued growth overall and our steadier transaction and accrual type business showing the strength of our global client network, while we saw a pressure in our market-sensitive businesses reflecting the broader industry, even in products like investment banking, where we continue to gain share.During the quarter, we received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve for our 2019 CCAR submission.
These buybacks have reduced our common shares outstanding by over 10% in the last year alone, and help drive our tangible book value per share up 10% over that same time period.Given the current environment and market conditions, we'll stay flexible with a focus on making steady progress toward our financial targets through client-led growth and research discipline, including balance sheet credit and expenses.
Excluding the gain EPS of $1.83 grew by 12%, mostly driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding as well as a lower tax rate.Revenues of $18.8 billion grew 2% from the prior year, reflecting the Tradeweb gain as well as solid results in consumer and overall growth in our accrual businesses in ICG.
However, this growth was partially offset by lower market-sensitive revenues in ICG, as well as mark-to-market losses on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio.Expenses declined 2% year-over-year as volume growth along with continued investments in the franchise were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, resulting in our 11th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage.And cost of credit increased, driven by volume growth and seasoning as well as a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio, while overall credit quality remained stable.
And deposits grew 5% with contribution from both our Consumer and Institutional franchises.Looking at results for the first half of 2019, we saw continued momentum in consumer as well as the accrual businesses in ICG, which helped to offset the headwinds of lower market-sensitive revenues along with the continued wind down of legacy assets.
Average loan growth improved to 2% this quarter as we saw a smaller drag from promotional balances in the prior year, and we expect loan growth to continue to improve as we go into the back half of the year.Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 1% driven by loan growth, partially offset by higher contractual partner payments.
But importantly, we are managing expenses carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns, as seen again this quarter in our strong EBIT growth year-over-year.Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 5% year-over-year in the second quarter or 3% excluding a one-time gain, mostly driven by higher deposit revenues as well as a recovery in investment revenues.
We continue to see strong growth in our underlying Wealth Management drivers in Asia with 10% growth in Citigold clients and 7% growth in net new money versus last year.In total, operating expenses were down 1% in the second quarter as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume-driven growth and cost of credit was down 3%, reflecting a smaller LRR build relative to the prior year.Slide 7 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail.
Credit continue to be favorable again this quarter with NCL and delinquency rates broadly stable across the regions.Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8, revenues of $9.7 billion were roughly flat in the second quarter and down 3% excluding the Tradeweb gain, as continued momentum in the accrual businesses was more than offset by lower market-sensitive revenues and the negative impact from mark-to-market losses on loan hedges, as credit spreads further tightened in the quarter.
And corporate lending revenues of $538 million were down 9%, reflecting lower spreads and higher hedging cost.Total markets and security services revenues of $4.7 billion were down 4% from last year, excluding the Tradeweb gain, as growth in security services was more than offset by the decline in our markets businesses where the environment has been challenging and Investor client activity has remained muted.
And security services revenues were up 3% on a reported basis and 7% in constant dollars, reflecting higher rates as well as higher client activity.Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion declined 2% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investments and volume driven growth.
Credit quality remained stable and total non-accrual loans declined both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.Looking at the first half of the year in ICG, our operating margin improved by 1% as solid contributions from our growing, higher returning network businesses, most notably TTS and security services, were largely offset by the decline in our market-sensitive businesses.We are focused on continuing to build upon the strength that we are seeing in our network businesses by making it easier for our large multinational clients to do more business around the world.
However, net interest margin declined 5 basis point sequentially as the benefit of higher revenues was more than offset by higher cash balances, reflecting strong deposit growth in the quarter.In the first half of 2019, our net interest revenue grew by 6% or roughly $1.3 billion year-over-year in constant dollars.
However, we should be able to more than offset this headwind with organic growth across the rest of our accrual and consumer businesses, and we should see a favorable comparison in markets revenues in the fourth quarter, even if investor client activity remains muted, similar to what we've seen so far this year.On Slide 11, we show our capital -- we show our key capital metrics.
For total Citigroup, expenses should decline sequentially and cost of credit should continue to grow modestly year-over-year, reflecting volume growth and continued normalization in ICG.With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.Questions and Answers:Operator[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystHi, good morning, Mark.
A large portion of the expected profitability expansion in North America Consumer comes from rightsizing the profitability in retail banking and you gave some positive commentary obviously and you feel pleased about the momentum in terms of deposit inflows, the digital strategies tapping your cards network or your cards clients.But you also have a lower rate environment and deposit spreads are likely going to come in and I think you didn't have any growth in revenues in retail banking.
And can you maybe just speak to some of the unique aspects of the business like trading -- trade finance that should drive some lower loss levels through the cycle, since that was actually pretty encouraging commentary from our point of view.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, I mean, again, when you think about our corporate lending book and the quality of our exposure, the multinational clients that we cover, the 83% of it being investment grade type exposure.
Can you help us understand, like does that mean that over time you have the chance to still take the tax rate lower as you look into '20 and as part of your plan for the RoTCE improvement?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerWe're constantly looking at it and trying to identify opportunities, looking at obviously where we book business and the client demands around that and where there are opportunities to do that.

citicorp,q3,2019,"Deposit momentum continued with a strong contribution from both traditional and digital channels as we leveraged our brand in scale and credit cards to drive deeper multi-product relationships with our clients.Internationally, EBIT was up 26%, excluding the gain on sale last year.
The backbone of our global network, Treasury and Trade Solutions had strong revenue growth of 7% in constant dollars, while the Private Bank grew as well.In addition to achieving stronger business performance, we remain focused on improving the returns we deliver to our shareholders through our capital plan.
Starting on Slide three, net income of $4.9 billion in the third quarter grew 6% from last year and EPS grew 20%, mostly driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding, as we've continued to buyback shares throughout the year consistent with our capital plan.Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 1% from the prior year and were up 2% excluding the roughly $250 million gain on the sale of our asset management business in Mexico last year, reflecting solid results across both our consumer and institutional businesses.
Expenses increased 1% year-over-year, as volume growth along with continued investments in the franchise were partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets.And cost of credit increased driven by volume growth in seasoning and consumer, while overall credit quality remained stable.
And looking at year-to-date results in Consumer, excluding both gains in 2018, we generated 4% revenue growth, while expenses were roughly flat, resulting in 9% growth in operating margin and 12% growth in pre-tax earnings.Slide six, shows the results for North America Consumer Banking in more detail.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were, down 2% year-over-year, as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and higher volume related expenses.Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by 9% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios.
Revenues of $9.5 billion were, up 3% in the third quarter, reflecting continued momentum in TTS and the Private Bank, combined with strong performance in Investment Banking and stability in Fixed Income Markets, partially offset by softness in Equity Markets and Corporate Lending.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were, up 6% as reported and 7% in constant dollars as we continue to see strong client engagement and solid growth in transaction volumes partially offset by spread compression.
We would expect the underlying business drivers to continue to perform well in TTS, given our unique global footprint and ability to deliver integrated solutions to our multinational clients, despite continued uncertainty around the macro environment.Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were, up 4% from last year, outperforming the market wallet, reflecting continued strength in debt underwriting and strong performance in M&A, particularly in EMEA.
Private Bank revenues of $867 million were, up 2%, driven by higher lending and deposit volumes, as well as increased investment activity with both new and existing clients, partially offset by spread compression.
Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion increased 4% year-over-year, as investments, volume-driven growth and higher compensation costs were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Looking at year-to-date results in ICG, our operating margin improved by 1% as solid results in TTS and strength in Investment Banking were offset by the decline in equity markets revenues.Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate Other.
As you can see year-to-date net interest revenue grew by 4% or roughly $1.3 billion year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by 5% growth ex-markets, reflecting strength in North America Branded Cards and TTS, as well as the absence of the FDIC surcharge.Looking at results for the quarter, net interest revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and declined by roughly $250 million sequentially, reflecting the impact of lower markets net interest revenue.
So it is starting to work, I think, I referenced earlier the growth in digital deposit sales and referenced that in fact a good portion of that is coming from card customers, who previously did not have a retail banking relationship with us.
But how are you guys going to think about as you go through your planning and what the target for kind of 2020 is your balance wanting to show improve in RoTCE versus what's it might be a more difficult environment?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.
Thanks.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystHi.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerHi, Mike.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystFirst, look you're growing revenues faster than expenses, this was the 12th quarter in a row, whether you didn't call it out that way.
Mark, I was hoping you could speak to some of the factors that pressured the markets for related NII specifically, as I think back over the last two to three years as rates were rising, higher funding cost were consistently highlighted as a drag on your liability sensitive trading book and with rates declining, we're really not seeing that benefit from lower funding costs on the way down.And I was hoping you could help us unpack what's happening on the trading side?
And then just bigger picture as you think about the need to add scale to the US retail franchise, whether it might make more sense to grow inorganically, and is that even a viable option, given your current size or the current share of industry liabilities that you currently retain?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerSure, I'm not on this call going to speak to specific names, but in the not too distant future, you will see us coming out and you know our portfolio of world-class partners in our co-brands and in our retail services business and we've been working with a number of them on new value propositions around those offerings.
Just the retail bank strategy and appetites maybe grow inorganically?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYou know, it depends -- your definition of inorganic and so again, if we continue to find as an example, portfolios of loans or cards or those types of things that we can acquire and fit from a client demography perspective, fit from a business line perspective and obviously are accretive to our returns wide open to it.
And as we think about 2020 should growth in Branded Cards revenue more reflect the sort of mid single-digit loan growth that you've been showing?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, we would expect that volume at that pace would be the major driver.
And so that's how we'll think about capital return going forward, but the CET1 target at this stage remains at the 11.6% levels.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystThanks a lot, Mark.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
And deposits grew 9% with contributions from both our consumer and institutional franchises.Looking at year-to-date results on Slide four, revenues were, up 3% on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of FX, as well as the roughly $150 million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio in the first quarter of 2018 and the previously mentioned gain on the asset management business in Mexico.
And so we're getting continued use of the card, top of while it used as evidenced by those purchase sales and the benefit of them now being interest earning balances for us.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd that should, that's been the case for the past number of quarters.
We'd expect that to continue to play out in the fourth quarter and continue to get some spread benefits, but likely going forward well into 2020, the benefits will continue to play out from a volume point of view, some volume growth will continue to be an important factor as well.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystAnd what you're doing on the promotional balances offers, I've just noted some long 21-months type offers out there, just don't know if that's a growing percentage of the book or just tweaking at the margin?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYou know, we've now -- we've kind of reached the mix -- our desired mix of promotional balances that we are looking to have in the portfolio.
What exactly are you doing to penetrate that, it sounds like it's starting to work?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. We are, as we think about investments we've made in technology and our ability to mine the data that we have of our customers, we're able to create value propositions that they're likely to respond to and open up a retail banking account with us.So for example, we know which of our card customers enjoy and prefer our thank you rewards programs in which of our card customers respond to many of the other programs that we offer from a rewards point of view.
And so our ability to mine that data to create value propositions around things that our clients are motivated to, has -- or motivated with has resulted in the growth that we're speaking to now.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think the other piece of that Glenn is, so far we have done that exclusively with our own proprietary products.
So I think we've got the ability to continue to expand on that.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystOkay, thanks so much.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you.OperatorYour next question is from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystHi, good morning guys.
And there are puts and takes there, in parts of the business, there'll be pressure from some of this uncertainty in parts of the business like markets, there could be some positives, as we see volatility persist.And so we really need to get through the budgeting process to both understand what we think that topline is likely to look like, understand what levers we have available to us to pull in order to continue to demonstrate progress and see what we might be able to do to narrow that gap and deliver on our targets.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think as Mark alluded to, John, the other thing that -- I've very much want to do is get the benefit of continuing to talk to our clients in terms of how they're thinking about things, not just, I think as you've probably heard more broadly this morning in terms of the US, but when you globally look at the consumer, consumer's in fine shape, we saw the IMF come out this morning and revised growth downward.
So there is the higher performance from a base compensation point of view, there's some strategic hires that we've made in parts of the franchise.And then lastly and you've alluded to it, but it certainly played out in this quarter, as well as we've seen pressure on some of the wallets and as we've thought about kind of the long-term or longer term business model and benefits from technology that will play out, we've made some capacity adjustments and those capacity adjustments obviously come with a cost and so that is part of the -- what you see in the quarter as well in that 4% increase.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystSo you feel that even in a lower growth, but on negative growth, lower growth environment, you can still get the operating leverage over the intermediate term?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerNo think, we -- look, I mean obviously and adjusting the capacity here, we're going to see some benefits of that play out in 2020.
Really strong growth on a period-end basis, particularly on ICG, is that sort of end of quarter balance sheet positioning by some of your clients and that's rolling off or do you think that's sort of some sustainable growth, and if so, what's driving that?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYou know, we actually -- you're right, we did see strong growth in deposits across the board in TTS specifically as well.
And what is the role of technology in helping you do so?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerI'll take the first part.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, OK.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSo look, you're right, we have reflected positive operating margin, we expect that to continue for the full-year of 2019.
And so when we came into the year, what we told you was we would be going at every lever and looking at all the things that we could do and I think this year we've done that, I think clearly technology, when you go back to Slide 23 and look at our consumer business and some of the drivers around contact -- look around contact rates, digital mobile engagement, e-statement penetration, all of those moving, I think very nicely in the right direction and those continue to give us not only cost benefits, but as and more importantly, service benefits in terms of the reactions to those.So I'm guessing Mike that given what's out there, the 2020 will continue to be a year where everything is on the table.
We're going to kind of look at the multitude of those levers and we're going to kind of go pull it those as we see fit, but at the same time, not sacrificing the investments that we need to make to either maintain or continue to attempt to build competitive advantages in the US and around the world.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerOne think I'd add to that is, so if you think about technology and its benefits and how they manifest themselves, one as it relates to the offerings that we're able to create for our clients, so our ability to create solutions around our client's problems.
And so we are committed to the 12% within the realm of what makes sense for our firm, and in particular for our shareholders over the intermediate to longer term and I think you've seen again in this quarter, we pull at every lever we need to get there, but we're trying to do it smart and you have my commitment, Mark's commitment, we're going to continue to do that to do everything we can to deliver that 12%.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerI completely agree with that.
And so, it's just kind of maybe thinking through some of the puts and takes of that?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, we haven't given any guidance on day two, as you said, obviously the composition of the balance of the portfolio in any given quarter is going to be an important factor in estimating what that impact will be.
Why the book is enacting a little bit more liability sensitive and should we see any funding benefit over time as the Fed it continues easing?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, so I think -- look, I think it's, if you turn to page -- that Page 11, kind of, highlighted the mix that the dynamic that you're referencing, and that I spoke to, which is that we're obviously seeing lower NII from our markets business that's completely -- that's being completely offset and markets non-NIR.
Our ability to be in the room on not just trade, but more broadly defined supply chain management and really what that means in terms of a lot of companies today that operate in kind of just-in-time inventory is critical and as examples you know what we've seen out of the China mix is trade routes with Vietnam and India being a couple of the beneficiaries of that, and I think our ability to move with our clients in terms of what that means, how is this pretty well positioned out there, and it's something we're obviously wanting to make sure we're in the room and as part of.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd I think we're uniquely positioned to be part of that dialog, just given the globality in our presence in -- over 98 countries etc, so...Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGreat, thank you.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
But as you referenced we've got truly a national cards franchise and depending whether you cut the line at our proprietary network or you go to some of our co-brand and retail partners, we're touching as many as 70 million consumers across the United States virtually in every state.And I think as Mark referenced in the numbers and some of the experimenting we've been doing on the deposit side, our ability to grow outside of footprint of the deposits brought in not just in the quarter, but really year-to-date, two-thirds of those brought in outside of those six markets, of those deposits that were brought in over 50% of those deposits were brought in by people who do not have the relationship, the depository relationship with the bank.
Thanks.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, our consumer deposits while we did good growth in volume there, we did see pressure from a spread point of view.

citicorp,q4,2019,"Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC -- filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2018 Form 10-K.With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Liz. Our earnings per share of $2.15 were over 30% higher than a year ago and the $8.04 for the full-year was over 20% above 2018.We finished the year with a return on tangible common equity of 12.1%, just ahead of our 12% target for the year, this is 120 basis points higher than our 2018 return on tangible common equity of 10.9%.In constant dollars, our 2019 underlying revenues increased by 4% in both Global Consumer Banking and our Institutional Clients Group, good revenue growth paired with disciplined expense management allowed us to deliver positive operating leverage even as we continue to make significant investments in the franchise.
We continued to gain share in Investment Banking and the Private Bank posted good revenue growth of 6%; Treasury and Trade Solutions continued to grow despite a lower rate environment as we work to ensure our global network remains indispensable to our multinational clients.We ended the year in a strong capital position with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.7% and we're on track to deliver our Investor Day commitment of returning more than $60 billion of capital to our shareholders over three CCAR cycles having returned over $22 billion in 2019 alone.Our dividend creates a very respectable yield for our common shareholders and we reduced our shares outstanding by 11% during the year.
Starting on Slide three, net income of $5 billion in the fourth quarter grew 18% from last year as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate.EPS grew 34% including the impact of a 10% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding as we've continued to buy back shares throughout the year consistent with our capital plan.Revenues of $18.4 billion, grew 7% from the prior year driven by higher non-interest revenue and reflecting continued solid results across consumer, as well as our accrual businesses in ICG along with a rebound in markets.
Expenses increased 6% year-over-year, reflecting higher compensation and volume related expenses along with continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, and cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning in consumer, as well as volume growth and a few episodic downgrades in ICG, while overall credit quality remained stable.Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12%, better than our outlook reflecting discrete tax items.
In constant dollars, end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $699 billion as 3% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind down of legacy assets and deposits grew 6% with contributions from both our consumer and institutional franchises.On Slide four, we show our full-year results.
And looking at full-year results in Consumer, excluding both gains in 2018, we also generated 4% revenue growth, while expenses were roughly flat resulting in 9% growth in operating margin and 13% growth in pre-tax earnings.Slide six shows the results for North America Consumer Banking in more detail.
Client engagement remained strong with purchase sales up 7% and average loan growth improved to 4%, while our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans expanded to 921 basis points this quarter.In Retail Banking, our deposit momentum continued to improve with average deposits up 7% with a strong contribution from both traditional and digital channels.
In total, operating expenses for International Consumer Banking increased 3% in the fourth quarter as investment spending and volume driven growth was partially offset by efficiency savings and cost of credit was down 6% driven primarily by Mexico.Slide eight shows Global Consumer Credit trends in more detail.
Total Banking revenues of $5.5 billion were up 3%; Treasury & Trade Solutions revenues of $2.6 billion were up 2% as reported and 3% in constant dollars as we drove strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits and transaction volumes, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates.
We continued to see robust underlying business drivers in TTS, reflecting growth with new clients, as well as the deepening of relationships with our existing clients, including 10% growth in average deposits, as well as double-digit growth in our cross-border payment flows this quarter.Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion, were up 6% from last year, outperforming the market wallet, reflecting strong performance in equity and debt underwriting particularly investment-grade underwriting as we leveraged our global capabilities to help clients optimize their funding needs.Private Bank revenues of $847 million, were up 6%, driven by higher lending and increased investment activity with both new and existing clients, partially offset by spread compression and Corporate Lending revenues of $732 million were roughly flat as growth in the commercial book was offset by lower volumes in the rest of the portfolio.Total markets and security services revenues of $3.9 billion, were up 28% from last year.
And finally in Securities Services, revenues were down 1% on a reported basis, but largely unchanged in constant dollars as higher volumes from new and existing clients were offset by lower spreads.Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion increased 8% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation-related expenses and legal costs.
And net interest margin increased by 7 basis points sequentially, also driven by the higher markets net interest revenue.And turning to non-interest revenue for total Citigroup, this quarter, we generated strong year-over-year growth in non-interest revenue of roughly $1.2 billion.
We drove 2% revenue growth with a balanced contribution from both our Consumer and Institutional businesses.On the expense side, we were able to hold expenses flat, while making significant investments in the franchise as productivity savings continued to meaningfully outpace our incremental investments, as well as offset volume related expenses.
And I guess I'm wondering does that include your expectation for what day two CECL impact is likely to be, and maybe you could speak a little bit to how you're thinking about CECL and what's your assumptions are for the reasonable supportable period of CECL from an economic input perspective?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSure, let me, kind of, break that in two pieces if I can.
We continued to attract digital deposits from both existing and new customers, bringing the total to $6 billion for the year.Better sentiment helped increase our Wealth Management revenues in Asia and our Cards business contributed to growth in Mexico.
And on a full-year basis credit cost of $563 million were consistent with what we would expect annually given the size, as well as the quality of our portfolio.For full-year 2019, our net income grew 3% on the combination of revenue growth, positive operating leverage, continued credit discipline and a lower tax rate.
Looking ahead for 2020, we would expect a quarterly pre-tax loss of roughly $250 million in Corporate/Other, as we continue to invest in infrastructure and controls and see some impact from lower rates, as well as a reduced level of gains.Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue split between our markets business and the contribution from the rest of the franchise excluding markets on the top of the slide.
In line with the high end of our latest outlook, mainly reflecting strength in North America branded cards and TTS.Looking at results for the quarter, we saw a rebound in markets net interest revenues, both year-over-year and sequentially, while growth in the rest of the franchise was more than offset by the headwinds of lower rates.
As Mike mentioned, the revenue environment has changed since we set our targets for 2020 with lower interest rates, slower global growth, and the pressure we've seen in industry wallets in markets and banking.In an environment similar to the one we are operating in today, we expect to deliver an RoTCE in the range of 12% to 13% for 2020.
So we expect we will continue to make progress in improving our returns and we look forward to having the opportunity to talk more about this year and beyond at our Investor Day in May.With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.Questions and Answers:Operator[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous.
Is that a pace you think you can keep up with the new initiatives on deposit growth?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSo we've seen good deposit growth as you said through the year in both our Consumer business, as well as on the Institutional side and that in many ways I think is an important proof point around our consumer strategy.
That said, we've delivered on the 1% we've talked about as guidance for the revenue growth for the quarter and I think it's 2% for the full-year.We would expect to see continued pressure from the Sears portion of the portfolio, particularly on the purchase sales and that said, it is still a very profitable portfolio for us.
And I'm just thinking as we try to unpack the walk to that 12% to 13% you spoke of, and the fact that you do have provision likely trending higher in 2020 and assuming no further benefit on the tax side, just help us think through what are some of the key drivers to help us get to that 12% to 13%?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSure, so look, I think it's -- if you think about what we saw this year and some of the key important drivers of performance, you can kind of look across many of the businesses and see good top line growth underlying and good EBIT performance.
But if we look at the second half of last year, the operating leverage, particularly in the Investment Bank has been minimal, it's been OK, but you had 7% -- as a firm you had 7% growth, top line growth with some investment gains, 6% expense growth in the fourth quarter.So I just wanted to understand, I think the upside -- the upper end of that range would imply some pretty good operating leverage.
Those were obviously increases in expenses in the year that will play out or damage or reflect or generate benefits in 2020 again creating capacity.And then you referenced the back half, and particularly if you look at the ICG in the last quarter, you got to kind of keep in mind that growth in expenses is 10%, top line growth is 8% expenses -- expense growth, but that comes with the compensation increase associated with those revenues.
The volume increases associated with that activity that we saw in the back half of the year and so you really got to think about the full-year expense base as we go into 2020 as the timing for both investments and the productivity benefits will vary through the course of the year and we'll get into much more of this and the forward look beyond 2020 obviously at Investor Day.OperatorThe next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
And we think we've got the ability using technology, client engagement, wallet share of gains, a lot of the leverage that we've spoken to on the revenue and expense side of continuing to make improvement and make progress against those benchmarks.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. We've made progress over the past couple of years when we talked last about our underlying performance, consumer and the ICG, we pointed to consumer as having the opportunity to close the gap between where we were two years ago and something we thought it was up in the 20% or so.
There a number of factors there that impact day two and we've consider that as we look at our 2020 forecast and as I've given you that range, it factors in that consideration.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystOkay, thanks.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerWelcome.OperatorThe next question is from Ken Houston with Jefferies.
Anything else just changing in terms of just flows that you see from the business outside of normal course, that's coming via the repo market, the Fed balance sheet expansion or is it just really was a seasonality?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerIt was seasonality and we obviously work to ensure that we were meeting client needs, while being able to deliver inside of that bucket, but nothing outside of that, nothing related to kind of the repo activity as you mentioned in the market.Ken Houston -- Jefferies -- AnalystOkay.
Thanks.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerYes, so as I mentioned, we expect kind of total revenue growth in 2020 with a mix from both NIR and non-NIR.
What are some of the data points do you think we need to look at throughout the year where the revenue growth could come in stronger?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.
So I guess the question is as you look out to 2020, do you expect securities gains to continue, do you have any impact of one-time gains and also what are your assumption for outside of the US?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerVivek, I apologize.

citicorp,q1,2020,"Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements, due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, as well as those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Form 10-K.With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Liz, and good morning everyone.
The significant loan loss reserves we took also reflected the Day-2 impact of the new CECL accounting standard.In our Institutional Clients group, we had strong performance in our markets business, as we help clients navigate severe volatility.
Our investments in risk management and controls, while never complete, are also serving us well in the face of the severe economic downturn and large swings across markets, whether in equities, fixed income or commodities.We've tried to help keep our people financially healthy as well and reduced the stress they're facing.
These bills are larger given the significant impact this change in our economic outlook has on our estimated lifetime losses under the new CECL standard.Revenues of $20.7 billion grew 12% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher markets revenues and the benefit of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio.
Our effective tax rate was 19% for the first quarter, below our full year outlook, reflecting a small benefit associated with stock-based incentive compensation.The ultimate economic impact of this health crisis and our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters.
We're combining this financial strength with operational resiliency given investments in our people, operations and technology along with digital capabilities, which allow us to partner with and support our clients as we all manage through this crisis.Turning now to each business.
Total credit cost of $4.8 billion were up significantly from last year, including a reserve build of approximately $2.8 billion, primarily related to the impact of changes in our economic outlook.Slide 6 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail.
In addition, the enhancements we have made to our digital capabilities have prepared us to better respond and continue serving our customers as they manage through this crisis.Digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter at $1.6 billion.
These capabilities are allowing us to remain engaged with our clients, even as roughly 40% of our branches in the U.S. are now temporarily closed, driven by lower customer traffic, particularly in urban areas.Turning now to the businesses; branded cards revenue up $2.3 billion, grew 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% loan growth and continued spread expansion, with net interest revenue as a percentage of loans, improving to 933 basis points this quarter.
We also saw strong engagement with existing clients driving balanced growth across deposit products, including checking.While AUMs declined by 6% due to market movements, we drove continued growth in Citigold households and investment fees during the quarter.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were down 1% year-over-year, as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume-related costs.Turning to credit total credit cost of $3.9 billion increased significantly from last year.
However, given the rapidly changing economic environment due to COVID-19, we are likely to see increased pressure on NCL rates in the back half of 2020, consistent with the reserve actions we took this quarter.On slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
However, average deposit growth remained strong at 8% this quarter and we continue to drive digital engagement across the franchise.Today, we are seeing some early signs of a pick up in activity in China, as movement restrictions have eased over the past week or so.
However, I would note that investment grade debt underwriting was up double-digit year-over-year as we helped our clients source liquidity in this evolving environment.Private Bank revenues of $949 million grew 8% driven by increased capital markets activity as we supported our clients through turbulent market conditions and higher lending and deposit volumes partially offset lower deposit spreads, reflecting the impact of lower interest rate.
And the pre-tax loss was $535 million this quarter, higher than our previous outlook, reflecting loan loss reserves on our legacy portfolio, marks on security, the impact of lower rates, as well as the special compensation award.Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trend.
In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.5 billion this quarter declined slightly year-over-year as the impact of lower rates was mostly offset by loan growth and an extra day along with higher trading-related near.
Why don't I start Mike or...Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerSure, go ahead.Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerLook, I think our view is, we are clearly living in uncertain period of time.
If that's a fair question?Michael Corbat -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. So I mean if you think about CECL and how it works in the idea of building expected lifetime losses in any given quarter.
But I'm curious if you have a perspective and whether you think the stress losses should be sort of a reference point for how useful they are to measure whether a given bank or your bank has adequate reserves?Mark Mason -- Chief Financial OfficerLook, I think you've said a lot there.
And including the $4.1 billion transition impact as we adopted CECL at the beginning of the year, as well as the additional reserves taken this quarter, credit reserves stand at roughly $23 billion with a reserve ratio of 2.9% on funded loans.With the level of capital, liquidity and the reserves we hold today, plus significant pre-provision earnings power, we are operating from a position of strength.
So in total, we grew purchase sales 3% in branded cards in the first quarter, but the trendline over the past month would indicate a significant decline in purchase activity in the second quarter, which is expected to impact loan growth.Retail Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were largely unchanged year-over-year, as a benefit of stronger deposit volumes, and an improvement in mortgage revenues were offset by lower deposit spreads.
We built roughly $2.4 billion in reserves this quarter, reflecting the impact of changes in our economic outlook and net credit losses grew by 8% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards' portfolio.
However, we continue to see pressure on overall loan growth, and while we haven't yet seen the full impact from COVID-19 in Mexico, we did see a slowdown in purchase sales in March, which is expected to continue, as customer behavior will likely follow the pattern we've seen in other region.
I would also note that we are taking appropriate actions to manage new and existing credit exposures, including investments in our operation, and importantly, as I've noted on prior calls, we feel good about the quality of our consumer credit portfolios, both relative to the industry, as well as Citi's historical risk exposures.If you look at our U.S. card portfolios, as an example, the FICO distributions of our outstanding loans and open-to-buy exposures, skew much more toward the higher end than before 2008 crisis.
That said, clearly, the impact of COVID-19 is not fully known at this point, and we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio.Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 9; revenues of $12.5 billion increased 25% in the first quarter, a strong performance in fixed income and equity markets, as well as the private bank, is partially offset by lower revenues in TPS and corporate lending.
Treasury and trade solution revenues of $2.4 billion were down 5% as reported, and 2% in constant dollars, as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rate.
Given the breadth of that relationship, we are playing a pivotal role in helping our clients navigate through these unprecedented time.We continue to see robust underlying business drivers in TPS, including 24% growth in end of period deposits in constant dollars, as well as 6% growth in cross-border flows, and we continue to see the benefit of our investment in technology given the accelerated adoption of digital tool.In March, while we, as well as most of our clients were working remotely, we opened close to 1,000 accounts digitally, three times the number we opened digitally in March of last year.
But as we exited the quarter, we did see the full pressure of the lower rate environment begin to take hold, with revenues down 9% year-over-year in the month of March on a reported basis.Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were largely unchanged from last year, outperforming the market wallet as growth in M&A and equity underwriting were offset by a decline in debt underwriting.
And while average loans were roughly flat, we did see a meaningful increase in end-of-period loans this quarter, reflecting the drawdowns and new facilities that I mentioned earlier, as we continue to support our clients.Total markets and security services revenues of $6.5 billion increased 37% from last year.
Equities revenues of $1.2 billion were up 39% versus last year, reflecting a strong performance in derivatives, including an increase in client activity due to higher volatility.And finally, in security services, revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and 5% in constant dollars, driven by higher client activity in deposit volume, partially offset by lower spread.
Overall, we feel good about our corporate credit quality, and like consumer, we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio and reserve levels relative to the stresses we see out there today.Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate/Other.
Revenues of $73 million declined significantly from last year, reflecting the wind-down of legacy asset, the impact of lower rates, as well as marks on legacy securities as spreads widened during the quarter.
As we look to the second quarter, we expect both net interest revenues and non-interest revenues to decline, reflecting the full quarter impact of lower rates, as well as a much more pronounced impact from COVID-19.On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics.
We remain disciplined in our target client strategy and feel strongly that our focus on these higher quality, more resilient segments is the right strategy in any economic environment.Looking to the second quarter and the rest of 2020, let me remind you that we are all operating with a great deal of uncertainty today, and our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters.
With that said, given the adverse impact of COVID-19, we no longer expect to deliver the RoTCE of 12% to 13% for the full year.Based on what we're seeing today, on the top-line, we expect the revenue trend in the latter part of March and the beginning of April characterized by COVID-related lower level of activity, particularly in banking and our consumer franchise will continue through much of the second quarter.
That should hopefully give you a sense of how we're thinking about the environment and our pre-provision earnings power.Turning to credit; looking ahead to the second quarter and the remainder of 2020, we do expect a higher level of losses given our current outlook.
What I'd point out is, you know the cards piece obviously is that roughly 9.5% excuse me, of LLR to loans, but again, we tend to -- to think of this as a higher quality book -- in terms of the factors that become important, there are a host of variables that we run through our model, as well as combined with a severity of a recession, probability of a recession.
And again as I suspect, as those things create challenges, it's likely that we will see a reaction come out of those bodies, to be able to address it.So I think the plumbing is actually working pretty well, that in spite of working remotely in the numbers that Mark and I spoke to, we had in late March record volumes of trading, in terms of settlement, clearing, margin, margining in the system and again, most of that done remotely and we all would have said to each other six, nine, 12 months ago we're going to model for this type of stress, we probably all would have been skeptical in terms of how the system performed.
And so I would expect -- we would expect there to be continued pressure on purchase sale volumes through most of the second quarter in light of the way this is persisting, and that should play out as well on ultimately loan volumes, in which we expect to see some top-line pressure there.Similarly, as you've referenced, we have a large retail services business and we have partner clients who we had advised in that regard and we've been working with them to help drive sales digitally.
That said, we've got a number of partners who do operate -- or large partners, I should say who do operate as essential resources to the economy, and while they will have lower store traffic, they will be able to continue to kind of serve and ultimately, as I said, we would expect the second quarter to have some of that top line pressure play through and over the course of the year to see a pick up in NCLs, subject to of course, how things like the $2 trillion relief package and some of the other customer relief offerings that we put out, take hold.Kenneth Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystYeah.
You saw us in very early March go -- I think as the first U.S. bank to go out and engage around, in particular, our consumer customers, in terms of opening up channels and talking about some forbearances and some forgiveness on fees and other things to get them engaged.
