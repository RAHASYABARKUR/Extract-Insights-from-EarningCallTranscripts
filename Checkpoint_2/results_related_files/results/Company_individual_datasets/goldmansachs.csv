goldmansachs,q2,2018,"I'll walk you through our second quarter and first half results, then cover each of our businesses, and, of course, I'm happy to answer any questions.Second quarter net revenues were $9.4 billion.
While it's impossible to predict the future, we remain cautiously optimistic that many of the broader drivers underpinning the solid start to the year -- healthy economic growth, positive investor sentiment, and the emergence of new market trends -- can remain in place.Let's review individual business performance for the second quarter.
For the year-to-date, we ranked No. First half performance was a record, reflecting our strong client engagement and multiyear investment in the business.
Year-to-date, we rank No. Clarity from U.S. tax reform, a supportive economic backdrop, generally resilient equity evaluations, accessible financing, and the virtuous cycle of M&A in certain sectors are all supporting activity.Moving to Institutional Client Services, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter, down 19% compared to the first quarter, but up 17% versus the second quarter last year.
While performance declined from a solid first quarter, client engagement remained healthy and the overall backdrop remained constructive for our market-making franchises.FICC client execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the second quarter, down 19% versus the first quarter, but 45% higher than the second quarter of 2017.
We continue to monitor and manage our overall expense base, with an emphasis on paying for performance to attract and retain the best talent and spending to support our clients, while investing in technology and infrastructure to grow the firm for the future.
We reduced our year-to-date compensation to net revenues ratio to 39%, down 200 basis points from the first half of last year, reflecting our strong year-to-date revenue growth and our emphasis on profitability.Non-compensation expenses were $2.7 billion, up 6% versus the first quarter and up 24% versus a year ago.
As we look ahead, we currently expect non-compensation expenses for the second half of the year to be materially consistent with the first half.As we continue to build scale and platform businesses, there is a natural migration from compensation to non-compensation expenses over time.
The $5 billion repurchase plan remains within the range of expectations we laid out in April and we will resume buybacks this quarter.On the Stress Capital Buffer, it's important to recognize that, for several years, we have managed the firm's capital to a stressed concept.
Across each of our seven revenue initiatives, we are running ahead of plan and continue to make progress in each of our businesses.For example, in Investment Banking, we're hiring new bankers and expanding and enhancing our client coverage.
And, finally, we're making solid progress across a variety of lending initiatives, including expanding our customer base of Marcus borrowers and depositors, growing our lending to PWM clients, and continuing to prudently deploy capital through our institutional lending and financing business.Clients remain the center of everything we do.
The $625 million of net NII in the quarter reflects a $2.5 billion run rate and that is an outgrowth of growing the lending book.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystOkay, great.
I'm just curious if you could talk toward that.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, Glenn, in our business, we have a variety of ways of looking at it and our merchant bank.
From a disclosure standpoint, maybe in some of the newer businesses, whether it's on the lending side, is there more that maybe could be done or that you guys are looking into, either to maybe improve disclosure and transparency?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, Michael, we're leading and running the business for the long-term and we know the importance, obviously, of delivering revenue and earnings growth, hence the growth strategy that we outlined for the market, driving more recurring fee-based revenue, expanding products and services, and broadening the client base.
I just would love to get more color from you.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerThe comp to net revenue ratio, as you know, Christian, is the 39% is our best estimate at this point for the full year.
So in light of that evolving competitive landscape, what's Goldman's edge in building on Marcus here?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, Christian, as we outlined -- and this is the way that we are making all of our decisions as we build out this business, indeed as we launched ourselves into this business in the first place.
Sometimes these revenues are lumpy.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, we're certainly seeing all kinds of trends at play and you mentioned some of them.
Are you kind of suggesting to us in that commentary that you really don't want to go below a 12% ROE because, if we kept the 41, it would have been below that?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWe were not setting the comp ratio in that way at all, Betsy.
And can you give us just some perspectives on that?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, Brennan, I'm happy to note that you saw the increased disclosure and we're working on it.
We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of when you laid those out in some detail and I was wondering when might we expect a more fulsome discussion of kind of where you are in terms of meeting some of those objectives.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, sure.
There's many ways to comport these statements that the results of this year's test are more severe with the Fed's statement that capital levels are appropriate for the industry across the board.The last thing I'll mention is that, if the SCB is finalized, the relevant print would be DFAST 2019, not the one that we just saw.
And then just how we should think about that in terms of kind of broader consumer finance and wealth management growth, especially as you add more products to the offering.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, certainly -- actually, I was just talking to Adam Dell this morning and, if you walk into our building, you can see Clarity Money on the pillar and I absolutely, some time ago, downloaded it myself and use it.
What do you see that, over the next 3 to 5 years, as Marcus grows and as you grow your corporate loan book, what do you think that can reach as a percentage of revenue?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, we've certainly highlighted for you that we are emphasizing in our strategy not only expanding the client base and delivering more products and services to that expanded client base, but also revenue growth, earnings growth, more recurring, stable, fee-based revenues.
And I've got a second question on asset management as well.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, let's start with that first question on prime.
And then kind of what was the corporate lending growth quarter-on-quarter?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerSo it really is loan growth, very, very broad-based, and so if you look at our HFI loans receivable, they grew $3 billion on the quarter.
I mean, is that just a portfolio that you can walk away from at some point?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, we certainly look, as you know, at all of our businesses through a large number of metrics and the way that they're treated in CCAR is certainly one of the many metrics.
For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2017.I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, expenses, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, supplementary leverage ratio, and stress capital buffer.
Our first half revenue growth results from broad-based momentum across the firm, as all four of our business segments grew at a double-digit pace versus first half of 2017.Institutional Client Services increased 24%, reflecting a 32% rebound in FICC, where we continued to grow our client franchise and strengthened our market-making capabilities.
This quarter, our clients responded to a stronger U.S. dollar, weaker EM currencies, higher oil prices, and a divergence between U.S. investment grade and high-yield spreads.Despite the persistence of geopolitical and economic risks, the backdrop remains constructive, as our clients continue to seek our advice and market-making services.
Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2 billion, 14% higher than the first quarter, driven by robust growth in advisory and continued strong and stable performance in underwriting.Financial Advisory revenues were $804 million, up 37% relative to the first quarter, reflecting higher completed M&A volumes.
Results were our third highest on record and up 3% versus the first quarter, as strength in equity offerings offset lower debt underwriting.Equity underwriting net revenues of $489 million increased 19% percent to the highest level in three years, as our volume growth outpaced the industry.
Strength across all regions drove performance, including notable deals in Asia, such as Xiaomi's $4.7 billion IPO, which was the largest technology IPO since 2014.Debt underwriting net revenues were a robust $752 million, down 6% from last quarter.
1 in institutional leverage loans globally and Top 3 in high-yield.Our investment banking backlog increased significantly versus the first quarter to reach a record level, driven by M&A and underwriting.
Mortgages was relatively flat sequentially.Turning to Equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion, down 18% versus a strong first quarter, as equity market volumes and volatility declines.
Equities client execution net revenues of $691 million declined from the first quarter, which was our highest quarterly performance in three years.
Over the past three years, we have had a balanced franchise, with derivatives and cash each contributing roughly half of equities client execution revenues.Commissions and Fees net revenues of $763 million declined 7% on modestly lower market volumes across regions.
On a year-to-date basis, our equities I&L businesses generated $2.4 billion of net revenues, roughly 65% from corporate investments and 35% from real estate.Our global, private, and public equity portfolio remains well-diversified with over 1,000 different investments.
We continue to evaluate new product opportunities, including wealth management, credit cards, and others, with our criteria for launch predicated on our ability to address consumer needs, apply the core competencies of Goldman Sachs, and deliver attractive returns to shareholders.Moving to Investment Management, we produced record net revenues in the second quarter, driven by strong incentive fee realizations and solid contributions from both our asset management and PWM businesses.
Transaction revenues of $182 million declined 14%, driven primarily by lower PWM client activity.Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.5 trillion, up $15 billion over the first quarter, driven by $8 billion of long-term net inflows spread across all asset classes, $10 billion of liquidity product net inflows, offset by $3 billion of market depreciation.Now let me turn to expenses.
We will provide updates on our tax rate once we have final guidance from Treasury.Turning to balance sheet liquidity and capital, our global core liquid assets averaged $237 billion during the quarter, which we expect to decline as we deploy our balance sheet to meet client needs.
Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.8%, up 10 basis points versus the first quarter.On capital return, we paid $314 million in common stock dividends, which included a 7% increase this quarter to $0.80 per share.
We have also seen success year-to-date with corporate clients, supported by our expanded FICC and Investment Banking joint ventures.In ICS, we continue to gather feedback on our performance directly from our clients and from third parties, where indications continue to be positive, and our client volume market shares have improved.
By successfully implementing these initiatives, we expect to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth and enhance the durability of the firm's earning profile.In conclusion, when we think about our ability to drive value, we are encouraged by our roughly 15% returns year-to-date and the further benefit from our growth plans, giving us increased confidence in our ability to deliver attractive long-term returns for shareholders.
Please go ahead.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning, Mike.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystHi. My question relates to why isn't Lloyd Blankfien staying to the end of the year and what changes do you expect with David Solomon taking over the helm?
How much is that up?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerSo I'm not gonna break out the percentage change, other than to say it was strong growth on the quarter.
IS that a 2018 specific decline or should we be thinking about the longer term tax rate being lower as well?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, it is a 2018 story.
We mentioned $5 billion annual revenue in three years' time without the market opportunity set expanding.
Granted there's endpoint sensitivity to these types of analyses, but I'm just wondering, were there any particular things that might have held you back in the Equities business this quarter as we try to think about how we kind of annualize and go forward?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerI'll start by saying our Equities franchise, which I had the opportunity to co-head some number of years ago, is one that I wouldn't trade for anyone else's equity franchise.
Meaning what areas seem to be maybe hitting close to all cylinders and are there areas or regions where you just feel like there could be quite a bit of upside just to even get back to some type of baseline activity level?Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, the way I would look at the first half of 2018 is it was great results and no question that we're pleased with them.
Please continue with any closing remarks.Marty Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerSince there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call.

goldmansachs,q3,2018,"During the third quarter while we saw quieter levels of client activity in certain businesses, several positive macro trends continued including healthy global economic growth particularly in the US, strong CEO confidence, open financing markets, rising equity market valuations, and stable credit spread.
While it's impossible to predict the future, we remain cautiously optimistic given active client dialogs, healthy economic growth, and resilient investor sentiment.Let's review individual business performance for the third quarter.
Equity underwriting net revenues of $432 million decreased 12% sequentially amid lower follow-on volumes, but more than doubled versus a year ago as IPO activity accelerated supported by strong activity in Asia.
We also ranked Number 1 in global IPOs. Debt underwriting net revenues were $632 million, down 16% from last quarter amid lower industry volumes.
Our Investment Banking backlog remains at robust levels, but decreased versus a record second quarter driven by M&A completions and underwriting.Our backlog still remains up significantly from a year ago.
Third quarter net revenues were $3.1 billion, down 13% sequentially, but roughly flat versus last year.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.3 billion, down 22% sequentially and 10% lower than a year ago driven primarily by low levels of volatility and client activity.
Equities client execution net revenues of $681 million were roughly flat sequentially and up 17% versus a year ago.
Performance was supported by strength in our derivatives businesses, partially offset by lower cash revenues from program and on exchange electronic trading.Commissions and fees of $674 million were down 12% sequentially, but roughly flat versus a year ago.
Security Services net revenues of $439 million were flat sequentially and rose 9% versus last year reflecting higher average client balances as we continue to invest to expand our footprint in the business.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.1 billion reflecting net gains from private investments, primarily driven by improved corporate performance.
On a year-to-date basis, our Equities I&L businesses generated $3.5 billion of net revenues, roughly 60% from corporate investments and 40% from real estate.Our global private and public equity portfolio consists of over 1,000 different investments and remains diversified across industry and geography and balanced across investment vintage.
Net revenues were down 8% sequentially driven by significantly lower incentive fees, but up 12% versus a year ago on higher management and other fees and incentive fees.
As we expand the firm and grow our businesses and we emphasize lending and also platforms, increasingly our focus is turning away from comp to net revenue ratio where -- which has historically been a topic on these calls, and really to efficiency ratio overall where we're looking at comp and non-comp expenses holistically with the focus on profitability.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI Institutional Equities -- AnalystFair, OK.
Just given what you guys have done to build out the Investing and Lending business and the makeup today, just how much will the public market volatility, maybe wider credit spreads impact it versus sort of the core lending growth and then maybe on the equity side like if GDP growth continues to be healthy?
So just imagine when you look at the strength of the Investment Banking business and you find us in Number 1 positions across a range of different products, imagine us extending that product set now to corporate cash management and other similar such businesses and I think the opportunity there is fairly extensive growth in areas that we have not played in before.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Thank you.Ms. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2017.I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, expenses, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, supplementary leverage ratio, and stress capital buffer.
Scherr -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Heather, and thanks to everyone on the call for joining us this morning, I'd like to make a few comments before I turn the call over to Marty to walk through our third quarter results.
We will do so by better leveraging our core competencies of advice, risk management, and technology solutions; and by encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship within the firm.Importantly, we remain committed to executing on the revenue growth opportunities we laid out for you about a year ago.
This is why, David, John, and I along with the rest of the leadership team will look for new ways to grow our businesses while improving our operating efficiency for the long term.
David will join our earnings call in January and is looking forward to being a participant in the quarters and years ahead.Finally, I would like to thank Marty for his many contributions to the firm as our CFO.
I'll now walk you through our third quarter and year-to-date results, then cover each of our businesses, and of course we'll be happy to answer any questions.Third quarter net revenues were $8.6 billion, net earnings were $2.5 billion, earnings per share was $6.28, return on common equity was 13.1%, and return on tangible common equity was 13.8%.
Our year-to-date revenue growth demonstrates solid progress across the firm as all four of our business segments grew at a double-digit pace.We grew our Institutional Client Services revenues by 16% or $1.5 billion, accounting for 40% of the year-to-date revenue improvement.
Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2 billion, down 3% versus the second quarter, but up 10% versus a year ago driven by a rebound in equity underwriting.
Turning to Equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, down 5% sequentially; but up 8% versus a year ago on better performance, higher US equity market volumes, and higher average volatility.
Results this quarter also included a provision for loan losses of $174 million, primarily related to loan growth.Our I&L assets included approximately $105 billion in loans, debt securities, and other assets and $21 billion in equity investments.
We posted net revenues of $1.7 billion in the third quarter driven by continued growth in our asset management and private wealth businesses.
We emphasize paying for performance to attract and retain the best talent and investment spending to support our clients while building technology, infrastructure, and platforms to grow the firm for the future.Compensation and benefits expense include salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior equity awards, and other items such as benefits.
Roughly 55% of the increase versus last year continued to be from expenses related to client activity and investments for growth, including approximately $425 million across Marcus, our consolidated investments, and technology; and approximately $190 million from higher brokerage, clearing, and exchange fees.
We have a strong capital position to both serve clients and invest for growth.Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts.
Our solid double-digit year-to-date revenue increase demonstrates the capabilities in each of our client businesses and we continue to work hard to grow further from here.
So as you noted, it's $160 million in revenue on the debt tender and the geography in our financial statement is approximately evenly split across FICC ICS, Equities ICS, and I&L.So, approximately evenly split across those three categories.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
And of course on the Equity I&L line for both private and public, it will be affected by market valuation levels, but the operating performance is really what's critical and we saw that driving the results in that segment this quarter.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein.
I guess if you could share just an update on the growth initiatives you guys outlined to expand the customer footprint and kind of where you are in the ability to pick up extra billion dollars of revenues over the next couple years?
Scherr -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerYes, the only thing I would add to that is I think that the speed and efficiency with which our ratios recovered over three quarters following year-end, I think speaks volumes about the agility of the business to adjust.
I simply want to point out that those are businesses where acquisitions are efficient, both as I said in the acquisitions of talent and IP and equally time to market, particularly in the consumer business where the opportunities may present themselves.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Martin Chavez -- Chief Financial OfficerSo on your question on Marcus, I would say that it's important to recognize that there are a number of different components to Marcus that contribute to the 2020 objective, unsecured lending in the Marcus platform being one but equally the value of deposits in that franchise being another.
I guess the point I'm making is that when you look at the loan component that makes up a number of different inputs to that target, our ambition is not to stretch, stretch to the target, meaning we're not going to let that business sort of grow because the target is out there in terms of balance sheet if in fact the market and the environment is not hospitable to it.
And finally, I'd say and an example of this would be the nascent plans now around corporate cash management, which is I view us as having an extraordinary set of relationships with corporates to sort of look and build that business on a technology platform that will be rather edgy and I think our ability to capture it now is more real than it would have been years ago.
Scherr -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerI would only add to that that, as I said earlier, we need to run and guide the firm with customer and client centricity at its core and in doing that, of course, we're mindful of the potential for changing circumstances in capital rules and we need to be nimble in the context of how we adapt to them just as we were over the last three quarters to adapt to change occasion by tax.
Longer term, I think we should hold ourselves out to even greater efficiencies because platforms will become more mature, delivery of product across all of our businesses will be more efficiently delivered, and you'll start to see pickup at the top line by virtue of the investment in the growth initiatives themselves.
Please go ahead.Guy Moszkowski -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystThis question, I think, is going to build a little bit on some of the earlier comments that you've made on platforms and margins going forward, but I wanted to take a look at, for example, FICC which has struggled over the years and this quarter again has a significant revenue downturn.
Of course, the market structure is different, and these businesses will evolve differently and at different speeds, but the lessons we've learned of building tools, having a tool-driven culture, putting those tools in the hands of our people and clients, that's what's going to drive margin efficiency and scale.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
And so Marcus as a platform is not to be viewed as an island within the firm.I'd also say that we have opportunity by virtue of relationships that exist with corporates through investment banking, to take those relationships and look to develop partnerships with consumer-facing organizations.
And so I offer this out, not just to give you an indication of what the platform might look like, what the forward roadmap might be with respect to product, but equally to sort of let you in on the adjacencies and channels and opportunities that exist around Goldman Sachs that can serve in the growth of what we've tried to build with respect to consumers.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Scherr -- Incoming Chief Financial OfficerI'd answer your question without limit to any particular division, meaning, if I look at investment banking, as part of the growth initiatives with the 2020 target, we set out to open offices in a number of different cities where we had not formerly been and to look to expand the client base because there is very attractive, accretive business to be had in and among those clients.
",26.82,0.7383702
goldmansachs,q4,2018,"We remain committed to delivering a full range of services to our clients, including advice, market liquidity, investment management and financing.As many of you know, John, Stephen and I are conducting a comprehensive front-to-back review across each of our businesses including three-year forward plans to identify opportunities, to strengthen or expand our client footprint and to operate more efficiently.
We are also actively engaged in pursuing opportunities to grow our addressable market by broadening client relationships and improving our mix of products, services, particularly to corporates.Specifically, as it relates to FICC, we are the leading institutional market making franchise.
Across these and other investments for growth, combined with a significant focus on operating efficiency, we are beginning to deliver on our commitment to enhance the durability of our revenues and our earnings.We continue to review our strategic priorities with our Board and plan to communicate a more comprehensive update to the market in the coming months.
Importantly, we are making significant investments to further expand our client franchise, ROE revenues and enhance the long-term earnings profile of the firm, the cost of which is being funded by the embedded operating leverage in our businesses.In summary, I'm extremely pleased with our performance.
The team I had assembled to execute on our priorities including John and Stephen have an increased sense of urgency and discipline to help move our business forward.With that, I'll turn the call over to Stephen who will walk us through the details of our financial performance.
For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7.9 billion, up 7% from 2017 on increases in both financial advisory and underwriting.For 2018, in addition to our leading advisory position, we held the number one position in equity underwriting globally.
For the full year, ICS generated $13.5 billion of net revenues, up 13% compared to 2017, driven by healthier volumes, better wallet share and improved execution in certain of our businesses notably in commodities.
Nevertheless, we continue to broaden our client and product footprint and deepen our relationships to drive higher rankings and market share.Second, we remained focused on leveraging our best-in-class investment banking relationships, to better serve corporate clients.
This is important as we are not relying on a market turn to yield better results, but are looking to expand our client footprint.Lastly, we remained focused on continued investments in engineering and electronification.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion in the quarter reflecting continued strong results in private equity investments.
The business remains well positioned for growth as we continued to invest in people and make bolt-on acquisitions to enhance our product offering to better serve our clients.Now let me turn to Page 12, for expenses.
This included an increase of $656 million in provisions related to litigation and regulatory proceedings, approximately $300 million of higher expenses relating to accounting changes due to the revenue recognition standard with substantially all of the remaining increase of $892 million from investments to drive growth and higher activity reflected in brokerage, clearing and exchange fees.Moving on to taxes, as mentioned earlier, our tax rate for 2018 was 16%.
We remain committed to serving and growing our global client franchise, building on the progress made in 2018 and further expanding our addressable market in 2019 and beyond.To achieve this, we're continuing to invest in our franchise, to broaden and improve our client capabilities through technology, talent, and by engaging in new disruptive activities.
The other half relates to general performance of the business and on that, as you could imagine, we deploy a number of different metrics in terms of how we arrive at valuation, but I think the important element to convey on that side is that there's a long history in the investing side particularly in equity in both sourcing, interesting and sometimes unique opportunities for businesses that demonstrate stability and growth trajectory and that performance feeds into the methodology we deploy against the private portfolio.
What we've identified that we think is a real opportunity given the scope and the magnitude of all the platforms over the firm, is to add some resources and broaden the plan to raise more money off the capital given the uniqueness of our platforms and the uniqueness of our sourcing capability and when you look at that opportunity and you compare what would be significant growth for us, compared to other people that are in that business, given our platform, our investing resources and our capability to manage money for institutional and individual clients, we have meaningful growth without setting overly ambitious targets.
So we are in the process of outlining that all in a much more clear way, there will be some hiring and additional resources that need to be added, but it's not a significant build because the fundamental investing platforms exist and is more opportunity to leverage that.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
And we think that's part of a more durable, more visible, more recurring set of revenue as part of the overall I&L picture itself.Michael Carrier -- Bank of America-Merrill Lynch -- AnalystOkay, thanks, and then just as a follow-up -- just on the expense side, so obviously 2018 you had some moving pieces with some of the legal, but just when you think about some of the investments that you guys have been making in some of the new growth initiatives on the technology side, how should we be thinking about the run rate going into '19 and in '20 in an environment where obviously the market has been a bit more -- a bit more volatile more recently?Stephen M.
All of the investments span in the different projects that David and I have been talking about, whether that's in Marcus or whether that's corporate cash management or whether that's the building incremental platforms inside the securities and trading business is in that $892 million.As I've said, 2019 will be a continuation of the investment.
My view is that the rate of growth in that expense, while it will grow, the rate of growth will be less than the rate of growth that we saw in '18 and we're going to continue to look to deploy existing operating leverage in the business as a source of that investment spend in the business overall.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein.
If three to five years ago, we said on one of these calls, that in 2018, we would have a year where our FICC ICS revenues were less than $6 billion, we were making significant investments in building out a digital consumer platform and we happened to be in a situation where we had outsized litigation expense, that we would deliver $36.6 billion of revenues and a 13.3% return, people would have said not possible, and the reason that that's happened is we have been working for a number of years to broaden our business, expand our addressable wallet and at the same point in time increase the durability of our revenues and you can see from the slide that we put up at the beginning that over the last X number of years -- five years, we've moved from less than 50% more fee-based recurring revenues to over 60% today.We continue to be committed to that and as we're developing a plan to move forward, we see things we can do in the existing businesses and adjacent builds some of which we mentioned.
And it's against that addressable market that we're going to take and are taking in part of -- as part of the front-to-back of U.S. to -- the proper expense size against that wallet and against that TAM, the amount of debt and liquidity we need to put against that business, the amount of risk that we need to take on in the context of intermediating risk for clients and then ultimately the amount of capital to put against it.This is not something that David and I have just woken up to.
And I'm not hesitating other than part of the front-to-back review that we are engaged in right now, is to answer the very question you're asking, which is again, understand the addressable market including an expanded set of customers and clients that we will focus on and then being quite clear about what our take in that market can be and then the inputs to driving that business, whether it's expenses, liquidity, capital and otherwise.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure.Guy Moszkowski -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystFollow-up question is in a different direction and just follows up on the comments that you made about the 1MDB situation and the litigation reserve bill that you quantified.
One, being an internal reallocation based on growth but second, and in the growth sense, we want to invest in areas which will carry accretive returns for our shareholders, and that can grow, and so our ambition and our MO will be just around that.Matt O'Connor -- Deustche Bank -- AnalystAnd then maybe a question for David on the capital theme still, you're clearly reviewing the businesses, you're looking to make revenues more annuity like than they've been.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystSo I wanted to start off with a question on some of the efficiency commentary and I have to say I was quite encouraged by the remarks really from both of you Stephen and David on that focus driving efficiency, the higher accountability from the individual teams and one of the interesting things that's been a big focus from investors is when we benchmark your efficiency ratio against the peers and really focusing in on the businesses that are comparable, the efficiency ratio range for the peers that's about 55% to 70%.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer(Technical Difficulty) an example of that is in any lending business when you're in a growth mode, you continue to have reserve build right to the point at which you're at a comfortable steady state and from there you start to see the margin increase.And so I think that each of these businesses whether it's corporate cash management or Marcus are all in their early stages.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell, I would just point out, I think that this is going to cascade down in the organization, meaning our ambition is to put more of the cost in the direct control of the businesses so that they are owning the front-to-back.
I'm excited about our new call format and presentation, which is an initial step as we continue to enhance engagement and disclosure.As shown on Page 2, it is important to underscore that our overarching priority is to execute our core mission, serving our diverse client franchise which includes corporations and governments, institutions and individuals.
Starting with our market making business in FICC and Equities, we have spent a significant amount of time evaluating all aspects of our businesses including our delivery model with a focus on providing best-in-class client experience and execution.
We're running the business with a clear perspective of its revenue potential.Over the recent years, we've made significant progress on improving capital utilization and reallocated capital away from FICC commensurate with its potential in order to grow strategically important and higher returning businesses.
We are now six months into a two-year build and our firm will be first to use the cash management platform later in 2019.In addition to validating the product, clearing our own operational payment flows will reduce costs and operational risks.
The fourth quarter, particularly December, was characterized by a decline in investor sentiment with respect to the global growth outlook, a concern that central banks would continue to tighten into a slowing growth environment caused weakness in equity and credit markets, and resulted in an increase in volatility of many macro assets.While this has created challenges for many of our institutional investing clients, it is also driving potential future opportunities for active managers to add value.
Clients continue to need comprehensive asset wealth management advice and individuals need simple and transparent financial services that add value.Next, I'd like to take a moment to address the ongoing investigations related to matters with the Malaysian sovereign development fund 1MDB.
In the fourth quarter, the business produced net revenues of $2 billion, up 3% versus the third quarter as a significant pick up in M&A completions helped offset a decline in underwriting revenues as the difficult market backdrop slowed issuance volumes globally.
We also participated in announced transactions totaling nearly $1.3 trillion which included over $450 billion from transactions below $5 billion in deal value, reflecting progress in broadening our client coverage.Moving to Underwriting, market volatility, declining equity prices, and wider credit spreads, weighed on issuer sentiment as net revenues were down 21% sequentially in the fourth quarter to $843 million.
This strong performance reflects our continued focus on building long-term client relationships and our ongoing investment in talent and capabilities.
FICC client execution net revenues were $822 million in the fourth quarter, down 18% versus 2017, amid challenging market conditions particularly in credit and to a lesser extent in rates.
Equities' client execution net revenues were up significantly versus a challenged fourth quarter of 2017 with better performance in cash.
Commissions and fees were 9% higher attributable to increased client activity following the significant uptick in volatility, particularly in low touch where we continue to gain market share.Securities services net revenues decreased slightly reflecting lower average customer balances.
Our share of global equity market volumes increased by over 100 basis points versus 2017 and included growth across all regions reflecting a multi-year positive trend.
I would point out that before accounting for future growth, we begin 2019 with an annualized net interest income run rate of $3.2 billion.Our Debt Investing & Lending balance sheet as shown on the lower left of Page 10, ended the quarter at $113 billion, which includes $94 billion in loans and $11 billion in debt securities.
On a like-for-like basis, our compensation ratio declined approximately 100 basis points year-over-year.Fourth quarter other operating expenses were $3.3 billion, which as I mentioned earlier, included litigation expense of $516 million as well as a donation of $132 million to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund.
Solomon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay, so I'm going to start, Christian, by making a couple of comments and then Stephen will go into, I think, a little bit more detail on some of the specifics that you mentioned.
But we're not confused by the fact that the available wallet in market intermediation for large institutions has materially declined over the course of the last five years.One of the things that's been interesting for me over the last two years once I became President and I started spending more time with a broader diverse array of our clients and I'd always go out for the last decade more than a decade and see investment banking clients and they always told me how extraordinary they thought our people were, the way our teams work together, the way they executed.
And I think in the process de-risk the firm from that perspective.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystAnd when you think about how you get paid for this business, I mean historically in the industry part of it has come from lending, so I just wanted to confirm that that's part of how you're expecting to get paid but also how you think about capital allocation to the loan book not only in corporate but in consumer, that a while back there was some commentary that you know maybe Marcus loan growth would be slowing, so maybe you could touch on that and also how you think about the balance sheet utilization toward loans versus toward buybacks?Stephen M.
So I think if you look historically from this time that we acquired the GE deposit platform in the U.S. Appreciate that.And then my second question, while we've seen spreads snap back and the loan market recover here, CLOs and levered loans became a big topic in the fourth quarter.
Just one follow up as relates to some of your comments on the marginal margin improving and I know it was a little bit more than a year ago when you initially laid out those growth targets on the revenue side of $5 billion.
I think it's largely been viewed as kind of a net cost cutting capital reduction exercise but you, on the other side of that, do you have any early reads on kind of what specific existing businesses look like they might deserve more investment or more capital than maybe you previously realized and just so that we know is this going to come with first quarter results or when should we expect this?David M.
Solomon -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystCan you guys share with us and I apologize if you already addressed this but what impact do you think the MiFID changes has had on your equity business.

goldmansachs,q1,2019,"First, we aim to grow and strengthen our existing businesses, second; we aim to diversify our business mix with new services to expand our opportunity set and increase the durability of our revenues; and third, we aim to operate more efficiently and effectively across all aspects, including expenses, financing and capital.To achieve these objectives, we will endeavor to deliver One Goldman Sachs to our clients.
Our new investments will generate results over time, and will be complementary to our long-standing core business, which we will continue to strengthen.Ultimately, we believe this strategy will allow us to serve more clients with differentiated products and services, increase the durability and predictability of our earnings profile, deliver improved profitability, optimize our capital, and deliver higher long-term returns for shareholders.With that, I'll turn the call over to Stephen to give you some additional details and walk through the results in each of our businesses.Stephen M.
As we go forward, we expect significant increases in client utilization, which carries the potential to generate revenue across a more engaged client base.As I mentioned, we are spending a significant amount of time on FICC, with a focus on growing revenues across each of our core businesses.
Today across both the US and UK, we have $46 billion of online retail deposits, leaving a tremendous opportunity for growth, and we will design our deposit platforms to capture our share.Pivoting to Investment Management, we continue to grow assets under supervision in key strategic areas, including advisory, outsourced CIO and ETFs, as well as in our world-class ultra-high net worth business, where we have modest share in a very fragmented market.
We currently have over $170 billion in alternative assets under supervision and plan to significantly increase fundraising in the months and years ahead.As we have said before, we are building Marcus, as a fully integrated digital business, as a broad multi-product platform, wealth management will be a key component.
Over time, as I mentioned earlier, we will seek to reduce the capital intensity of this business, by managing more client assets in fund form and reducing our balance sheet investments.On platforms, we are actively pursuing a number of work streams to digitize manual activities, expand straight through processing and reduce cost per trade.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerLook, I think, based on reserves that we have taken over the past several quarters, we feel confident that those reserves are proper and adequate.
The strategic M&A stuff is much more long cycle, and I don't think it's really been that significantly disrupted and the activity levels would certainly show that.In terms of market activity and client engagement, we saw significant pickup in the second half of the quarter.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerMichael, the only thing I'd add to David's comments is that, I think in Equities, we are seeing and saw over the quarter, month-by-month increases in prime balances, which speaks to an increasing level of activity.
I think when you look at investments that are being made over the course of '19 and 20, we have a view as we're now developing three-year models, as to when we will see, or begin to see efficiency play through.You'll see that in the context of cost per trade, you'll see that in the context of platforms that take lift, which carry with them higher marginal margin and less intensity in terms of expenses being put to it beyond the investment horizon.
I'd also say as it relates to the deposits, that over time you will start to see us build greater functionality around the deposit platform such that we are ultimately less reliable, or less reliant if you will on price, as the key sort of element.Right now the firm is a better incremental buyer of retail deposits and the numbers that we're suggesting a sort of rules of thumb about how inside the funding cost of wholesale these deposits come, are largely predicated on where we currently are in terms of price, but we'll be able to lower beta as and to the extent we put on greater functionality, greater stickiness, greater privity with those depositors.
But this is a conservative estimate in the context of, I think, what we're capable of growing and for that matter, whether there won't be other jurisdictions that we eventually look at.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
And hopefully you feel that today's presentation is another example of this.But we also recognize that as we do this, we want to get it right, we want to be clear, we want to make sure the people in our organization can put it forward with respect to their businesses, where the kinds of investments we're making over multiple years or things that we can really stand behind, as we work toward targets, which is something that we haven't done before.
In fact, as David said, we're going to engage in a very regular cadence and you're seeing it already, obviously, in the context of the presentation that we're putting in front of you.And in the interim period, performance targets will be on the offing, and we will review, whether financial disclosure needs to change in the context of the changing shape and profile of our business, and our organizational structure.
And so I think all of that will sort of put us in a place, where we have a cleaner, more forward-looking lens through which we and you can look at our business and whether that takes the form of at an Investor Day or some other form for a comprehensive update, we'll engage in that.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
And so that's the general direction of traffic for the consumer business, but I think it reflects more broadly on the overall firm as David laid out in the presentation.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
And so the take-up of deposit account openings, off of those that use clarity money is principally higher than what we had expected and what you might see in the industry.Equally, in the context in the category of delivering the firm in consumer, make no mistake that bringing together Marcus with our Investment Management division had a strategic component to it, which was, we were business that for many, many years, obviously managed funds and managed assets for high net worth individuals.
And unfortunately, I'm just not in a position to give you more clarity on what I think that timing looks like.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
And this is changing, the way in which we look at overall trade flow from the beginning, through to the middle in the context of collateral management, through to settlement, the place of operations in that chain now matters more than it's ever mattered in the past, in the context of our engagement, and the question of customer satisfaction and client satisfaction with the business.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell, as I said at the start, over the course of the next several months, we're going to take a long hard look at ways in which we can enhance disclosure.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo, we will over time look to give you greater insight into the overall spend and the cost of spend in the disclosure that will give you.
And I think that the margin that we will see on that lending will only improve to the extent that we further diversify, as we have laid out as a strategic priority, the overall funding mix of the firm.And so as and to the extent that we engage in this lending through the bank, we can avail ourselves of lower cost funding provided by retail deposits, which are obviously growing, as I've mentioned now several times in the call.
These elements are critical to our key growth platforms, including Marcus and Mass Affluent Wealth, where we will pursue partnerships to access large numbers of consumers, Marquee our digital institutional platform with the ability to innovate can help us engage at scale with our institutional client base.
These improvements will take some time to realize, but should ultimately create significant operating leverage for the firm and long-term value for shareholders.Turning to Page Seven; let me be more specific in terms of the initiatives in both our existing and growth businesses.
Lastly, these efforts will help us better serve corporate clients across the firm, including an adjacent areas like ICS and Investment Management.Next, in our Institutional Client Services business.
We have already taken many of these actions and expect to continue to make refinements over time.In credit, where synergies with Investment Banking facilitate our high rankings in both trading and underwriting, we are building models and tools to facilitate faster inventory turnover and reduce drawdown risk, as we execute client flows.
We are vertically integrating 7500 operations and engineering professionals directly into the business, to enhance the client experience and provide greater expense accountability to our business leaders.We're also making a number of changes to reduce costs and drive long-term operating leverage, by increasing use of shared platforms across our business, and migrating more of our efforts to locations, like Bengaluru, Warsaw, Dallas and Salt Lake City.
Based on last year's results, for every 100 basis points in efficiency ratio reduction we achieved, it equates to approximately $300 million of net income and a 40 basis point increase in ROE, all else equal.Before moving to discuss the quarter, let me turn to Page Nine, where we layout a road map for what to expect in the coming quarters in terms of performance targets, financial disclosure and a broader discussion of the strategic way forward for Goldman Sachs.
Let's run through the numbers.Turning to Page 11, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.8 billion, down 11% versus a solid fourth quarter and flat versus a year-ago, as very strong advisory performance offset a sharp decline in underwriting.
During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions of approximately $390 billion and closed on nearly $370 billion of deal volume, ranking number one in global completed M&A.Client dialogues remained healthy and we are seeing increased activity in sectors including financials, TMT, natural resources and healthcare.
In the first quarter, we ranked first globally in equity underwriting with $16 billion of deal volume across nearly 75 transactions,.Debt underwriting net revenues were $652 million, down 18% from a year-ago.
We are optimistic that a number of significant technology companies are expected to come to market later this year.Moving to Institutional Client Services on Page 12.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.8 billion in the first quarter, more than doubling fourth quarter levels, reflecting a better operating environment.
We saw higher sequential performance across all five of our global fixed income businesses, as markets reversed the sharp December risk-off moves.FICC revenues however, declined 11% versus the first quarter of 2018, amid lower client activity.
Results were impacted by significantly lower performance in derivatives, given lower market volatility versus the first quarter of 2018, when volatility was elevated and client activity was robust.Commissions and fees net revenues were $714 million, driven by lower client volumes versus both last quarter and versus a year-ago.
Security services net revenues of $370 million, fell by 14% year-over-year, amid lower average client balances, as hedge funds deleverage, though balances have been recovering.Moving to Investing and Lending on Page 14.
As I had commented on the last earnings call, this seeming inconsistency is because our portfolio skews more to private securities then public holdings, as shown on the slide, and there were less event-driven valuation remarks of our private equity holdings.Our global equity portfolio was $22 billion, at quarter-end and remains well diversified with roughly 1,000 different investments.
Our firmwide net charge-off ratio remained low at 50 basis points.On Page 16, turning to Investment Management, we produced one $1.6 billion of revenues in the first quarter, driven by our diversified Global Asset Management business and leading PWM franchise.Net revenues included management and other fees of $1.3 billion, which were largely in line versus the fourth quarter.
Overall revenues declined versus a year-ago due to significantly lower incentive fees and lower transaction revenues from PWM client trading activity.Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.6 trillion, up $57 billion versus the fourth quarter, driven by $20 billion of long-term net inflows in fixed income strategies and $59 billion of market appreciation, that being partially offset by $22 billion of liquidity product outflows.Now let me turn to expenses on Page 17.
For the quarter, our efficiency ratio was approximately 67%, up 100 basis points versus a year-ago, largely driven by lower revenues.Next on taxes; our reported tax rate for the quarter was 17.2%.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Steven Joseph Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystI wanted to start off with a question on the I&L strategy, so you outlined efforts to increase fee-based recurring revenues and reduce the volatility in that principal investment line.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah.Andrew Lim -- Societe Generale -- AnalystAnd how we might expect that to improve going forward, as you continue to, to raise customer deposits, let's assume that, asset yields stay flat going forward, just for the sake of argument, if you continue to raise customer deposits, how can we expect that $35 million to increase over coming quarters?Stephen M.
",16.97,0.550902
goldmansachs,q2,2019,"For the year-to-date, total expenses were $12 billion, down 6% year-over-year.Our year-to-date efficiency ratio was 65.6%, up 100 basis points versus a year ago, driven by lower revenues and ongoing investments, partially offset by lower compensation expense.
Also as we have noted in the past, as we grow more scale and platform-driven businesses, it is our expectation that compensation will decline, as a proportion of total operating expenses and the efficiency ratio will become a more relevant measure for the firm.
While we continue to assess capital return in the context of the market environment and opportunities for accretive investment in our business, consistent with our long-held strategy, we are encouraged by the increased flexibility afforded by our strong capital position.We enjoy the option of returning a significant portion of our earnings to shareholders over the coming year.
To the extent, we have excess, after these investments, we will endeavor to return it to shareholders.Second, with respect to dividends versus buybacks, we aspire to having a higher dividend long term, as it's an important component of total shareholder return and it's further reflective of the firm's confidence in our ability to generate more recurring and predictable sources of revenue.
We have spent a lot of time thinking about it because when you look at these businesses, which in the past, I did organized over multiple parts of the firm, we're now internally reorganizing and bringing them together.
And so over time, we will provide more transparency to you on the assets that currently exist in all four of these channels, which are significant and to our aspirations over time to increase the amount of third-party capital that we manage in these different asset classes.With respect to the balance and operating is, as I said to the previous question, we have been doing this for 30 years.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThe one other point I'll add to respond to your question is that, as David rightly points out, this will be a transition.
And it's also worth noting that different sleeves, whether it's credit, real estate, with respect to, for example, equity carry different capital density and the opportunity to realize higher returns on the balance sheet deployed will be there.
Meaning, as stewards of capital, we are looking at and for opportunities where we can invest in an accretive way to generate long-term shareholder return.
And I think what played out in the context of CCAR is a reflection of what we are comfortable with in terms of what we're going to look to put out, given where the market and circumstances are.On the question you raised about FICC, the focus for FICC, not born of this quarter in particular, but since we came on and started to look and reunderwrite the business, it's been around capital efficiency and equally cost in the context of delivering in to our clients.
And so that continues to be a focus of ours in terms of the franchise.When you look at FICC in particular, I would say that the business is focused on clients in the context of expanding out the corporates, transaction banking and the like.
Just given some of the investments and then the longer term, the focus on the efficiency ratio, just wanted to get an update or run through some of the initiatives that are in place and the progress you guys are making to lower the cost base over time and improve the efficiency ratio.Stephen M.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell, I think part of the calculus is the direction of travel, right, of where these regulations are, what the final SCB ruling looks like.
Meaning, what's happening on platforms that are introduced, that underpin incumbent businesses that are not looking for, if you will, new flows to come on, but we're transacting with clients in a different manner and form than what we've done in the past.Just one really small example.
Now, we're able to provide a platform where the client can engage and look to conform and develop a portfolio on a much more efficient basis -- cost efficient basis than would have happened in the past.So, I think there are sooner efficiency, or I should say efficiency to be realized sooner in the context of platforms underpinning incumbent businesses, there'll be a longer timeframe as you note in the context of realizing efficiency in some of the newer initiatives that we're building.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Now that's, again, a lot of assumptions, but it's based on the information that's out there on lower rates for the credit quality versus peers, what peers are charging and no fee.And I -- that another of my question is, how are you thinking about consumer lending?
But this is a risk business, and we'll continue to look at it as we grow it out on a risk-adjusted return basis.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystSo, on a -- really a follow-up has to do with the expected at-scale efficiency that you think you're going to be running these businesses at, when they're at scale.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think, I would encourage you to follow up, sort of with -- for an answer that's more precise than what I can give you now.
We reported second quarter 2019 revenues of $9.5 billion, down slightly versus last year, but nonetheless, reflecting solid franchise performance amid a mixed operating environment.
Our business performed well and remain solidly positioned for future growth.In Investment Banking, we ranked number one in global announced and completed M&A, and number one in global equity underwritings year-to-date.
Our equity market making business delivered its second highest quarter in four years, and our franchise continues to generate broad-based market share gains across regions.
We produced the highest quarterly I&L revenues in eight years, aided by significant gains from our private equity investment -- investing activities, reflecting our ability to source opportunities for the firm and our clients, and record net interest income in debt I&L, which annualizes to $3.5 billion.
Importantly, our clients' long-term needs for advice, financing and access to markets endure across cycles.Switching gears, I'd like to provide some insights on two important strategic decisions we made in the second quarter and our alternatives and wealth management businesses.
This will be a transition, and we are mindful in protecting the revenue potential of these businesses as we grow third-party assets.Second, we announced plans to acquire United Capital, a registered investment advisor with approximately $25 billion in assets under supervision, 220 advisors and 90 offices around the country.
United Capital represents a key step forward toward our long-term strategic goal of providing comprehensive wealth management services to individuals across the wealth spectrum.Upon closing the transaction today, United Capital will become a powerful complement to our Ayco business, our leading financial executive counseling and investment advisory business, it serves many of the largest corporations in the United States.
On a combined basis, Ayco and United Capital will serve clients with over $80 billion of assets under supervision, representing a strong base from which to grow our mass affluent wealth franchise.It remains ambitious -- it remains our ambition to continue to serve ultra high net worth individuals through our long-standing PWM business, individuals with $1 million to $5 million of investable assets to Ayco and the broader mass affluent segment through a hybrid of digital and human engagement as an extension of markets over time.Before turning the call over to Stephen, I would like to spend a moment on the recent Federal Reserve stress test results released in late June, which showed bank's ability to withstand over $400 billion of stress losses.
This change reflects the Board and Management's view that dividend growth is a critical component to delivering strong shareholder returns and reflects our progress over recent years, increasing more durable fee-based revenues to support the higher dividend.Lastly, I would like to briefly touch on our strategic communication plan over the coming quarters.
Financial Advisory revenues of $776 million were down 3% versus last year.During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions of approximately $465 billion and closed on $235 billion of deal volume, contributing to our number one M&A league table rankings year-to-date.
Our deal flows in this quarter were consistent with trends across the industry, which reflected materially lower volumes in the loan market and lower activity in acquisition-related financings, particularly with financial sponsors.Nonetheless, our franchise remains well positioned, with our high-yield league table rank rising to the number two spot year-to-date, further reflecting our competitive strength.
And while markets can change quickly, we are optimistic that our clients will remain active in executing strategic transactions in the coming quarters, given healthy levels of client dialog and continued needs to access financing markets.Moving to Institutional Client Services on page five.
Net revenues were solid at $3.5 billion in the second quarter, down 3% versus last year as our diversified business experienced low client activity in FICC, offset by strength in equities.FICC client execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the second quarter, down 13% year-over-year, reflecting both the mixed operating environment and generally lower client activity despite notable strength in Europe.
Specifically, we saw lower volumes in our macro businesses, amid low volatility and shifting client sentiment.Relative to last year, client activity in rates and currencies, including emerging markets was more subdued, as trade and tariff concerns, more than economic data drove sentiment and constrained client engagement.
We saw lower structured finance client activity versus a year ago, while flows in credit came alongside from a more muted origination backdrop, particularly in investment grade debt and leverage loans as I had mentioned earlier.Separately, mortgage revenues increased amid better performance.
We believe our success reflects our continuing consolidation of global market share and a dedication to serving clients across a full suite of cash, derivatives, and prime services, in both high-touch and low touch channels.Equities client execution net revenues of $772 million increased 13% relative to the first quarter and were up 12% versus a year ago.
We also continue to grow market share in low-touch execution.Security services net revenues of $458 million, rose 24% sequentially and 5% year-over-year.
Second quarter results were up 20% versus a year ago, primarily reflecting higher net gains from public equities.As you can see on the slide, approximately 25% of our net revenues were from real estate and 75% were from our corporate investments.
We produced $1.6 billion of revenues in the second quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading private wealth franchise.
Net revenues included management and other fees of $1.4 billion, which were up 5% versus the first quarter and up 4% versus last year, reflecting continued growth in assets under supervision.By contrast, we generated significantly lower incentive fees relative to the outsized $316 million last year.
We also saw lower transaction revenues from PWM client trading activity.Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.7 trillion, up $61 billion versus the first quarter, driven by $17 billion of long-term net inflows, $12 billion of liquidity inflows, and $32 billion of market appreciation.Now, let me turn to expenses on page 10.
Investment spending will continue into 2020, when we will also see a more meaningful impact of the reserve build supporting our initial growth in the Apple Card portfolio, following our expected launch later this summer.Year-to-date, the total pre-tax cost from Marcus, Apple Card, and our new transaction banking platform is approximately $275 million, resulting in a drag of roughly 60 basis points on our ROE.
While our second quarter performance was solid despite the mixed operating environment, we believe, as David said, the overall economic growth backdrop should remain supportive of our business.
And we're starting to see some early progress in that, I would say in this quarter, in particular within Europe.I'd also say that as part of an effort to expand out and penetrate further the corporate base around FX and rates, we're seeing some benefit come to us, by way of the joint venture between banking and FICC, where banking obviously owns an entry point into the corporates and the ability to carry through those products into the corporate franchise where we have a demonstrably strong set of relationships, I think will bear dividend.What's more, I would say that if you look at a variety of different initiatives and builds, including transaction banking or corporate cash management, this one's built, will carry the potential to bring forward a more captive FX business that didn't exist inside the firm.
But our treasury team is working hard, both in terms of the amount of liquidity we run with, how that liquidity is managed in addition to identifying more efficient lower cost funding sources in order to render these businesses more competitive.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Devin Ryan -- JMP Securities -- AnalystFirst question just on United Capital with the deal closing, just look to maybe get a little more perspective on how you're thinking about the business opportunity, I guess broadly.
Scherr -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystIn your comments on the debt underwriting, you mentioned deal flows in the quarter were consistent with the trends across the industry, which reflected material lower volumes in the loan market in M&A activity area.
