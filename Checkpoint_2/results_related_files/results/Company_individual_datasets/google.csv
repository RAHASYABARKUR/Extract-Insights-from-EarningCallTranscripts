google,q1,2020,"Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas maybe considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Third, I'll talk about our business, especially our advertising business, which was significantly impacted in the last few weeks of the quarter, and I'll close with our investment plans and focus for the rest of the year.In the early days of the crisis, we were able to put in motion a number of efforts quickly.
With respect to the implications of the global crisis for Google Cloud, we're proud of the accelerated traction we achieved across sectors including public sector and healthcare for disease monitoring and control, working with leading retailers on demand forecasting, working with companies across media and communications to enhance their customer service, and across industries on supply chain optimization.In the first quarter, other revenues were $4.4 billion, up 23% year-over-year primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues and Play.
In terms of Google Cloud, we remain very pleased with the execution by the team reflected in the ongoing pace of customer adoption of both GCP industry specific solutions and G Suite collaboration tools to help businesses operate efficiently and effectively.Moving on to profitability, while TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of items in other cost of revenues that are generally less variable in nature such as depreciation and operations costs of our technical infrastructure as well as for activities like customer support and content review.
We now anticipate a deceleration in headcount growth that should start to be visible in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter.Although we are focused on these and other steps to moderate the overall pace of investment, we remain committed to the long-term opportunities for which we are well positioned.
Obviously, we've had great success with Search and so we are bringing a lot of those learnings and we're sharing it with our customers and so we expect to see more traction there over time.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd on your second question, I like the way you framed it.
So across everything we do, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Play, be it Cloud, I think we are investing to capitalize on this long-term opportunity and I would say overall on Alphabet as well, when you look at investments like Waymo and Wing, you can imagine, in the future these things working well can play a significant role and and even in the limited areas Wing is in, we clearly saw its potential through a moment like this.
I think that the way I would answer that is after a decade of growth, there have to be opportunities for added efficiency and we've been focused on that for some time, but painful times like this put a spotlight on an urgency around making sure you're focused on the levers that you have and hopefully those instill the right kinds of health metrics etc against what you're managing.So I would say that the intent most certainly is that these are durable investments to ensure that we're operating as effectively and efficiently as we can be and I just need to reiterate, and Sundar and I have both said this, we remain committed to investing for the long-term.
First, I wanted to thank you for the color around the growth you're seeing as you were exiting the quarter in the ad business and there's been some signs from different partners or different companies that ad spending while still down considerably has actually improved a little bit, maybe some green shoots from the declines that you might have been referencing at the end of March.Any chance you can give us a sense of the type of growth you've been seeing for the first kind of three, four weeks of the quarter, just kind of just to help level set us and then, just in regards to the provision you mentioned in G&A related to credit deterioration, is there a chance you could tell us the amount of that provision and do you expect to have to do this again in the second quarter?
So by the end of March, total YouTube ads revenue growth had decelerated to year-on-year growth rate in the high-single digits.And then for the second quarter so far, I think it's premature to gauge given uncertainty in the environment and a few weeks, obviously, is not a quarter.
Thanks.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerIn terms of overall priorities, I would say we've always taken a long-term view through -- on thinking through the arc of where things are going and our deep focus on AI is an example of that and we've been convinced for a while that those trends will play out in the long-term.
So we continue to focus, anywhere we think the actual work we are doing is based on deep technology, deep computing, deep computational scale is the kind of investments we think still stand the test of time through things like that.Beyond that, we are actively looking at how user patterns are emerging.
So for example, e-commerce is an area and you saw us respond through this with the changes we announced on our shopping property and going for comprehensiveness there and with new leaders in place, we're going to be making sure we work on the user experience there and so we are looking at shifts be it video conferencing with Google Meet and G Suite and adapting and investing in those areas as well.
So that's how we're approaching it.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of the geographic breakdown for YouTube, we haven't broken that down although I think as you know well, we have a breakdown for the major regions around the world and to give you a little more color there, in mid-February, revenue growth across the business began to decelerate in APAC, although as I noted, the decline in APAC was more muted just given the uneven impact of COVID and the nature of our business across the region and then the impact in EMEA was first evident in mid-February with a steeper fall off in March and in the second week of March, we then saw results in the U.S. as well as other Americas fall off shortly, but nothing more specific by product.Michael Nathanson -- MoffettNathanson -- AnalystThank you, Ruth.OperatorThank you.
Maybe talk to us about as you sort of look back over the last couple of years at what you've done on the SMB side and what are sort of one or two of the key hurdles where you see you really need to invest and build more comprehensive SMB products for post recovery?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerMaybe I can give color both on the SMB and a bit on the ad side too.
I earlier talked about, you can imagine, if you're a customer and you have data centers, these are fixed costs when you go through moments like this and so people are really looking at opportunities there and so our teams are super engaged, but I do want to acknowledge maybe -- small businesses across the world are deeply impacted.
As a company, we've announced several efforts to support small and medium businesses and we are going to be deeply engaged with them, but I think it's a tough journey we are all on and we look forward to working with them to help them through this.OperatorThank you.
Could you explain a little bit more about the reasons for making those changes and expanding the free listings or creating the free listings and what drove you to make that decision now?And then a related follow up for Ruth, same question essentially, but as we think about the financial impact of such a change, imagine this is one of those things, which may qualify as causing maybe some variability in the quarter-to-quarter rate, but something that benefits all parties over the long-term, I think is how we've often visited these sorts of changes, but any color you could add on sort of the near and long-term impact of the Google Shopping changes would be great too?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerSo, going through a moment like this, it's very clear, you know, part of what makes Google work well is people come across a diverse range of needs and that's true for shopping.
We've been executing well over there for the past year and the growth on Google Pay has been strong and so being able to bring all of that together along with strong players like PayPal etc will help us give great experience for our users here.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd in terms of your question about the financial implications of the effort, there's really not much to add here today I would just say, reecho Sundar's comment works, excited to have Bill leading the effort, and as Sundar said at the outset, one of the priorities is creating sustainable financial value and we have a leader who has a demonstrated track record of doing that.
On direct response, I do think, I think people are -- it's a journey and people who have been investing are seeing that it is cost effective, and so, over time more people are looking at it.Our sales teams are doing an excellent job of helping our customers understand the opportunities there and so being able to bring all of that to bear.
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo as I tried to be really clear in my response to Heather's question, I would not extrapolate from my comments for the full quarter.
We have seen that the most pressing concern of small and large businesses right now is business continuity, solving for issues like employee safety, dramatic falls or surges in demand, supply chains, and managing a remote workforce.
Google Cloud is forming deep partnerships such as with leading healthcare provider, HCA Healthcare, to understand data around ICU bed availability, ventilator supplies, and test results and you may have read about our exposure notification partnership with Apple designed specifically and carefully to protect users privacy while helping public health authorities and governments manage countries reopening.Second, we are working hard to provide accurate and authoritative information to people using our services.
G Suite is helping Netflix and German manufacturer, Kaeser Compressors, transition quickly to remote work while Twitter, Shopify, retailer Schnucks, and Italian bank, Credem are using Meet for things like all hands and customer meetings.Elsewhere across the business, YouTube subscriptions continued to grow.
We'll be optimizing the way our data centers work and prioritizing strategic areas of investment where we need to support our users and partners.Let me express my thanks to our employees for their herculean efforts under these difficult circumstances.
Our results for the first quarter are a tale of two quarters with strong results across our revenue lines for January and February followed by an abrupt decline in March in our advertising revenues as governments globally instituted stay-at-home orders in response to COVID-19.
At the same time, even through March, our non-advertising revenue lines maintained their strong performance particularly Google Cloud.
In terms of the foreign exchange impact, exchange rate movements resulted in a modest headwind to reported revenues.Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC was $19 billion, up 19% year-on-year.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.5 billion, up 26% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses.
The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation and then content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube's advertising supported content followed by content costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube Music and Premium subscription services.
We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $117 billion.Let me now turn to our segment financial results starting with our Google segment.
Your line is now open.Doug Anmuth -- J.P. Morgan -- AnalystGreat, thanks for taking the questions.
People who may have been hesitant to shift their budgets are looking through moments like this and trying to get all that working better.Cloud is an obvious area.
Your line is now open.Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystGreat, thank you so much for taking the question.
",19.85,0.72310364
google,q3,2017,"Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor.Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth, and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.6 billion, up 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically: costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation; content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and hardware-related costs.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $5.5 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 32% year-over-year.The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
A couple of updates.Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with a number of notable launches, including the Nest Thermostat E, which is offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat.
As in prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers.In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in Cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we placed on this business.
The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites.
Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with a number of notable launches, including the Nest Thermostat E, which is offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat.Nest also announced a home security solution that includes the Nest Secure alarm system, Nest Hello video doorbell, the Nest Cam IQ outdoor security camera and corresponding software and services.
I frequently highlight our culture of innovation.In that regard, the most important point is that we are data-driven with an extraordinary team of engineers, product managers and designers who constantly challenge assumptions and run thousands of experiments annually to enhance user and advertiser experiences.
We continue to remain focused on long-term dollar growth versus margins.The pressure in our total cost of revenues reflects our product mix shift with a number of our higher-growth businesses also carrying higher cost of revenues.
It's been particularly exciting to see our early bet on artificial intelligence pay off and go from a research project to something that can solve new problems for 1 billion people a day.Even though we are in the early days of AI, we are already rethinking how to build products around machine learning.
I'm really pleased with the way our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome, have continued to grow, enabling great experiences for people all over the world and powering devices for more than 1,000 brands worldwide.
We are moving away from First Click Free to a more flexible model of content sampling, and we are working with publishers to build a frictionless payment solution for subscriptions that can help them grow revenues and find new readers.
And our advertising platforms continue to drive greater sales for our partners.While mobile has given rise to an unprecedented amount of data and complexity for advertisers, we think that machine learning will help it make -- will help make it easier for advertisers to reach consumers.
During the quarter, more than 1 million small businesses used it to build websites, helping many of them get online for the first time.We also introduced local posts, which allows small business owners to easily post their latest updates like upcoming events, special offers, and new arrivals right on Google Search and Maps.
And to help millions of people, we are building products specifically designed for local markets in Asia.In India last month, we launched Tez, a mobile payments and commerce app that already has more than 7.5 million users who have made more than 30 million transactions.
Wanted to understand better your ambitions in e-commerce as a marketplace or a platform and how that might also feedback into the advertising business.Second question will be about the cash on the balance sheet and sort of how philosophically you think about deploying that cash against either shareholder returns or some of the big opportunities you laid out today.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerMaybe I'll take the 1st question given to are up on the cash question.
And the approach continues to be productive, especially because the line of inquiry evolves as user behavior evolves.And so what users wanted in the earlier days of smartphones when screens were smaller is obviously very different from expectations users have today.
A little bit on growing Alphabet's multi-app ecosystem.Sundar, how do you think about the strategic importance to drive Chrome and Google Assistant app into dollars and user growth on non-Android mobile platforms?
Do you mind if you could share about early findings on the rollout of YouTube TV?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. Main thing I would say is the consumer feedback, I think there's always been this promise on being able to -- just like today on Google Search when you want something, we make it so easy for you to find it.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn emerging markets, we do see differentiated opportunity there, partly because the characteristics of how truly many of these markets became mobile first, I think, gives rise to different ways users are adopting our products.
We also benefited from substantial growth in other revenues from Cloud, Play, and hardware.Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $19.7 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $19.7 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
Network revenues were $4.3 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $3.4 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, Play, and hardware.Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
Further, our culture of innovation is building our nonadvertising revenue streams in Cloud, Play, and hardware.Earlier this month, for example, we launched our expanded line of hardware products, bringing the best AI software and hardware together and building on the first-generation of Made by Google products we introduced last year.
In our advertising businesses, TAC continues to increase as our highest growth areas, mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Third, as to CapEx, we continue to invest to support business momentum, including increased compute power from machine learning, which is an asset across Alphabet, as well as to support cloud, search and YouTube growth.In conclusion, a great quarter.
So you know it, you know, so this a lot more to come.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo in terms of your second question, there was really no change from the approach we've talked about previously as we think about capital allocation.
As you said in your question, we have a host of really exciting opportunities, and ensuring that we're investing to support long-term growth remains number one.
And then the third is the return of capital, and no change or update there in terms of how I think about that.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorThank you.
So I think overall, that's creating a good virtuous cycle, and I'm looking forward to having more momentum there.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd on your TAC question.
And I think the main point is we're very pleased with our strong partnerships across the mobile ecosystem.And the other was the ongoing shift to mobile, which we've talked about a lot, and the fact that it carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.
Thanks.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo it -- so like, a number of calls talked about the fact that there was no one item that was driving the momentum we saw in our sites revenue.
We are really pleased with the momentum in the business, excited about the opportunities we have given the ongoing strong underlying secular trend, but wanted to give you more color on what do we mean by a culture of innovation.
And I guess, in particular, how do you think about maintaining Google's lead as the way we search changes and as we see increasing adoption of these voice-enabled digital assistants in the home?
And people also see the room ahead, thanks to our lead in machine learning.And that's an area where I think we'll continue to drive advantage.
So we are driving it forward in a way in which we know it's going to give strong both revenue and earnings growth.
You have made large and exciting investment and growth opportunities across Google and Other Bets.
If we're doing that well, we're delivering long-term revenue and earnings growth.And those investments need to be seeded early for them to continue to grow and flourish around the globe, whether that response to the first question on what's going on in APAC or across Alphabet more broadly.
So it just made a lot of sense to do it.And I would also think about the overall capability we are getting, not just to make phones, but as we get into other product categories like Google Home, VR and so on, right?
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo in terms of TAC, as I indicated, we've got a couple of things going on.
So Sundar, can you talk about how Google's positioning in the emerging markets over the longer term can be different versus what we are used to seeing here in the States?
But again, I feel really pleased with the progress, momentum that we're seeing in the various businesses.And I guess, the only other thing to notice of is seasonality on the hardware as we move into the fourth quarter here.Stephen Ju -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystThank you.OperatorThank you and that concludes our question and answer session for today.
",32.19,0.8322702
google,q3,2018,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Our revenues in the third quarter continued to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud, and desktop search resulting in consolidated revenues of $33.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency.
The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing headcount primarily for Cloud and ads followed by advertising investments in Cloud, Chromebooks for the back to school season, and the Google Assistant.
Other revenues for Google were $4.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year fuelled by Cloud and Play.We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.
In terms of headcount, growth was seasonally higher in the third quarter because we brought on new graduates.We are continuing to invest in adding talent to our priority areas, particularly for technical roles in engineering and product management and to support our most sizable growth areas, in particular Cloud.
We have adapted many of our core products like Search Maps and YouTube to work well for the next generation of users coming online.We are also building products to meet the specific needs of users in the region like Tez, a digital payments app for India to help people easily pay their electrician or split it in a bill with just a few taps.
Referencing the blog post and some of the changes about how you see the future of search, I wanted to know what some of the key investments you think the company needs to make so that search becomes more visual or relevant and what that might mean tying it back to the business for engagement with your products, relevancy of over the medium to long term.
And Philip and Prabhakar, with them I think it's in great hands and I expect a lot of continuity there.On your question on search and Discover, it's -- in addition to making search more visual, one of the things we are very, very focused on is not always do users turn to us and actually ask a question.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn hardware, we always want to be at the forefront of computing and so -- and lot of times that involves thinking across the whole stack, bringing together the entire experience in an integrated way for our users.
And beyond that, we're looking at how the market adoption is and we are thoughtfully building a business, but we are committed to building and investing for the long run.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd in terms of how we're thinking about planning, we're in the middle of it now and many of the questions sort of been already asked sort of point to the direction that we feel really good about the underlying strength in the ads business as we've talked about on numerous calls.
And some of the comments that Sundar made about the opportunities that open up with visual search again continue to point the direction direct response, continue to point to some of the underlying areas in which we're focused.But as we've talked about on prior calls, that's one element of it and we continue to invest for opportunities that are sizable over the long term.
Sundar has already commented on both hardware and cloud as really important examples and we think the steps that we're taking, the investments we're making provide the foundational support for ongoing long-term sustained growth.
So, we are constantly looking for ways by which we can better serve Chinese users and that's where we are today.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of Waymo, in the third quarter, as I think you know, we extended our Early Rider Program to a larger group and we moved into very early days of commercialization.
Could you just talk a little about how you think about the gaming opportunity for Alphabet and what you think are the key factors you need to tackle to really build and scale direct-to-consumer facing cloud gaming product.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerLook, on the ad stuff, we've had ad formats in Maps for some time and we are constantly working to make it more useful and relevant.
On your second question, look, we today serve our users on gaming across Google ads in many ways, right.
And so it's early to say, but we are focused on doing the right thing there.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of technical infrastructure and our CapEx, as we talked about last quarter, CapEx reflects our view of the growing opportunity set in our core ads and search businesses as well as the longer-term opportunities in newer businesses in particular to support cloud.
So, we're really proud of what the teams are doing around the globe.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn your second question, one of the things we clearly see when we make a hardware product like Pixel in which all the tools and the utilities we build are conveniently there integrated and the experience is great.
So when we think about the big opportunity, where is the most natural fit to drive Verily going forward?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn Pixel, look, first of all, part of the big thing is this is our third generation of hardware.
Look, overall I mean it's now we've been doing this seriously at the next level for three years and we are definitely seeing strong indicators that are the investment in product is clearly beginning to work.
Could you just talk to the European business and what you're seeing there?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerLook, I mean specifically, I think if your question is around GDPR and so on, first of all, I mean we've always been as a company very, very focused on user privacy and security.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerLook, I mean I think on the first thing on e-commerce, maybe really people, we do see a lot of activity in the vertical on our products and we see strong growth there as well.
So, we are continuing to invest there and we are also driving strong partnerships with the retail sector both in terms of our shopping experiences as well as through cloud and I think that continues to be a big opportunity.And on your broader question, look, the reason we are investing across Google and Alphabet in a set of areas is because as a company over the past 20 years, we have developed deep capabilities in technology, in computer science, and especially with machine learning and AI.
The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, which continued to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses and content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube.Operating expenses were $11.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year.
As discussed in the previous two quarters, both operating income and OI&E are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments.
Our effective tax rate was 8.8% for the third quarter reflecting discrete items, notably an adjustment associated with the US Tax Act. Net income was $9.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $13.06.Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow.
Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 23% year over year.Operating income was $9.5 billion, up 11% versus last year and the operating margin was 28.2%.Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.6 billion reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction, and facilities.
This includes a number of data center construction projects in-flight as well as ongoing expansion in our compute capacity.I will now turn the call over to Sundar.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Ruth.
Last month we kicked off 20 years of Google Search by introducing some of the biggest updates in many years.They include a new AI powered ranking approach that delivers more relevant results, a redesigned Google Feed called Discover to help you stay informed on topics that matter to you, and a new search experience for Google Images.
Every day people from all over the world turn to YouTube to learn something new from career skills to coding to cooking.Just this week we announced a $20 million investment to expand our YouTube learning initiative, which will help fund established in emerging educational careers.
YouTube's ads business continues to provide great results for marketers and creators.
In apps we announced a partnership with Unity Technologies, which gives our advertisers access to one of the largest global networks of mobile gaming titles across 1.5 billion devices.
Google Drive became the eighth Google product with 1 billion monthly active users and Gmail now has more than 1.5 billion monthly active users.One of our big wins in the quarter was Fast Retailing, the Japanese retailer best known for its popular brand UNIQLO, which is migrating its employees globally to G Suite, while also pursuing AI solutions like on-demand forecasting on Google Cloud platform.
Our cloud business is benefiting from our investments in technical infrastructure including a US-Europe cable that will improve speed for millions of people.
Just one year since it launched, over 30 million people and businesses across India now use the app every month and they've collectively made more than 1 billion transactions.
Not only do these investments in data centers, machines, and offices allow us to provide great services to users; they have a strong positive impact on the communities around them supporting thousands of jobs and countless local businesses.
Your line is now open.Eric Sheridan -- UBS Securities -- AnalystThanks for taking my question.
And then with respect to your comments on YouTube, we're starting to hear from advertisers that there is some blurring between brand and direct response ad budgets as they look at products maybe more across blended lines.
Our ads leadership comes -- Prabhakar who has taken over our ads product and engineering efforts, is someone I worked with for many, many years and most recently has led our G Suite business, but has done many roles before, is a deep computer scientist.
We continue to invest here because we see ongoing opportunities in particular as we leverage machine learning to provide better experience for users and for advertisers.
Your line is now open.Douglas Anmuth -- JP Morgan -- AnalystThanks for taking the questions.
Sundar, can you help us better understand how the remedy in Europe will work in terms of licenses and TAC going forward and what impact do you see that having on financials?
So as you guys roll out more products like Lens and Gboard, and some of these other utilities on top of your billion-plus apps like Search and YouTube, is there any way to parse out what the overall engagement looks like in markets like the US and Western Europe when the phones are improving their functionality and you keep adding these additional utilities?
As you look out two or three years, do you think any of these businesses could really make a financial positive difference on the bottom line for overall Google?
",36.7,0.80946946
google,q4,2018,"We had a strong 2018 with total revenues of $136.8 billion, up 23% over 2017, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing investments to deliver exceptional experiences for users and compelling returns for our advertisers, partners, and enterprise customers.
For the fourth quarter, revenues of $39.3 billion were up 22% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency as we continue to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud, and desktop search.
In terms of dollar growth, results were led, again, by mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search.Network revenues were $5.6 billion, up 12% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and Google Ad Manager.
Machine-learning is also driving differentiation for newer Google businesses like cloud and hardware as well as central to a number of other bets, most notably, Waymo and Verily.
Because we make changes with a focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long term, the timing of the introduction of new experiences, particularly in search advertising can vary which can result in an impact on quarterly year-on-year growth.Second, during 2018, the FX tailwinds in the first half of the year turned to headwinds in the third and fourth quarters in line with the strengthening of the US dollar.
In addition to our progress in AI, we saw great traction across newer areas like the Google Assistant, hardware, and Cloud.And our core areas such as Search, Maps, News, YouTube, and our computing and advertising platforms continue their strong momentum.
This is an important long-term investment that lay the groundwork for our future computing needs, primarily to accelerate machine-learning across our businesses but also to support the opportunities we see in Cloud, Search, Ads, and YouTube.
And we see a lot of opportunity here.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of revenue and investments in YouTube, overall, as Sundar said, YouTube is continuing to benefit from the secular change in the way users are consuming content.
In terms of the expenses, I think what you're referring to is within other cost revenues, the primary driver in the fourth quarter was the increase in content acquisition costs due to YouTube growth.
And that's both for ad-supported content in what is, typically, a seasonally strong quarter and also, for our newer subscription businesses which do have higher TAC as a percentage of revenue, we're excited about the growth we're seeing here.OperatorThank you.
Thank you so much.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, in terms of the investment levels in other bets, the major point is that we're investing across other bets commensurate with what we think is required looking out at the opportunity set for each one.
And that was really to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain other bets.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn Cloud, one of the things that was evident toward the end of last year is now our ability to win very large customers, global 5,000 companies with multi-year contracts.
First, when you think about the strong Google sites growth, 22% FX neutral, can you just help us understand some of the mobile search innovations that you think are really driving things here beyond some of the just underlying secular strengths with a particular focus, perhaps, on the retail channel and just how you're thinking about the opportunities there?
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, in terms of growth, Cloud does continue to deliver a sizable revenue growth, driven by GCP.
I was curious, Sundar, as you think about with an innovation focus, what do you see as being one or two of the biggest opportunities to further improve the quality or the efficacy of the ad product you provide for advertisers on YouTube from here?
And we are taking all the right foundational steps to realize it.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd in terms of Waymo, as you know well, we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience.
Thank you very much.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, starting with R&D, the main driver is our ongoing investment in engineers, in particular, in Google and then as I said, the sizable increase in accrued comp for other bets.
And we wanna make sure we invest in that experience to get closer to what they want.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then on the second question, we've talked about this on prior calls.
And then we're investing aggressively in our newer businesses within Google, particularly Cloud and hardware as Sundar has already said.
A big part of that is the ongoing strength in YouTube and then on the OpEx side, investing in engineers, in particular for Google as well as on the sales and marketing side, the increased headcount to support not just Ads but, in particular, Cloud.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd on the same question on Cloud, I answered it around Anthony and Heather's question.
And then Ruth, coming back to the headcount and CapEx growth moderating comments -- so, you've had expenses growing well in excess of revenue for some time in the core Google segment.
And so, I think we'll continue down that path but obviously, always adapt to where the market is.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of the pace of investment, I've already laid out the focus areas and our commitment to invest to support long-term revenue and earnings growth.
I think many are just trying to search for a framework in how you think about this investment cycle we're in right now.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, the reason I started by laying out in response to the question on margins where we're investing and how we look at it is we are very focused on investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter.Our total revenues of $39.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $724 million or $600 million after the impact of our hedging program.
The key drivers were first, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, mostly for our advertising-supported content in what is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV which have higher TAC as a percentage of revenues; second, costs associated with our data centers in other operations including depreciation; and third, hardware related costs for our Made by Google and Nest family of products.
We provide more detail on these line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.Our effective tax rate was 11.2% for the fourth quarter, reflecting a discrete benefit due to the reversal of an accrual made as a result of updated guidance associated with the US Tax Act. Net income was $8.9 billion.
Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, cash CapEx for the quarter was $7.1 billion which I will discuss in the Google segment results.
The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by the ongoing shift to mobile which carries higher TAC followed by changes in partner agreements, offset by the seasonally higher proportion of YouTube advertising revenues in the fourth quarter.In Q4, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year primarily due to a revenue mix shift within our programmatic business.
I'll cover results for the full-year 2018 because it remains most instructive to look at the financials for other bets over a longer-term horizon, as we have discussed on prior calls.
With eight products with more than one billion users each and more people coming online every day, we remain excited by the opportunities to continue to create valuable experiences for users around the globe.In particular, we see significant ongoing potential to apply our machine-learning capabilities across our businesses.
Turning to investments and profitability, in terms of gross margin, the biggest component within cost of revenues remains our traffic acquisition costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business.
As we've discussed on prior calls, while the pace of year-on-year growth incites TA as a percentage of sites revenues slowed after the first quarter of 2018, we do expect the sites' TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search.Within OpEx, we remain focused on prioritization in order to optimize resources for longer-term growth in sizable markets.
From Smart Compose in Gmail to the new Google News experience to call screening on the Pixel and improving the overall safety of our products, AI is helping people get things done every day.
Google AI lead, Jeff Dean recapped the results of our efforts in a great post on our AI blog, like using AI to better detect the spread of breast cancer or providing flood victims with real-time information in a crisis.
As we do this, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to do the right thing and are continuing to build privacy and security into the core of our products, keeping users' data safe and secure with the industry's best security systems and giving people better and clearer controls.
Today, I'll start by sharing some of the new ways that we are working toward our mission.Then I'll give an update on our video and advertising platforms followed by the latest on our hardware and Cloud efforts.
And we demonstrated that at CES last month with lots of exciting new partners and features, from the Lenovo smart clock that wakes you up in the morning to real-time navigation that helps during your commute to a built-in interpreter that translates conversations across dozens of languages on Google Chrome.
Thanks to our strengths in AI in Search, Google Lens uses your smartphone camera to help identify more than one billion products.
YouTube continues to invest in its thriving community of creators and build great features for its nearly two billion monthly logged-in users.For instance, in Q4, we expanded access to tools like stories and community posts that strengthen the connections between fans and creators.
Since the product launched in March 2018, over 30% of the advertisers who use TrueView for Action were new to buying video adds on YouTube.
Google Cloud is a fast-growing multi-billion-dollar business that supports major global 5,000 companies in every important vertical with a robust enterprise organization.This was not the case just three years ago.
In financial services, we signed agreements with two of the top financial institutions in the US to help them transition their business to Google Cloud with our highly secure solutions.In retail, brands like Bed Bath & Beyond, DSW, and Ulta Beauty are using our cloud to manage data and provide more personalized experiences to consumers.
More than 20 years on, there is still tremendous opportunity for Google to help people save time, learn new things, grow their businesses, and build stronger communities.
I wanna thank every Googler around the world for making 2018 a great year for users and our business.
And that's really working at scale.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then the specific comment I think you're referencing is I was pointing to headcount growth.
A very strong quarter it sounds like on branded advertising and now some of these new direct response ads.
Maybe talk us through how you see the next one or two big factors that you're really focused on, ensuring that Waymo becomes what it could be.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn YouTube, I still think we are in early days of making sure YouTube is a better platform for direct response.
On your first question around using machine-learning to help serve advertisers better and be able to reach newer advertisers SMBs and local advertisers, I definitely think you highlight an exciting opportunity.
And they remain a strategy partner across multiple businesses for us, including Google Ads. And we have efforts under way to work closer together with shopping.

google,q4,2019,"Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Ellen and good afternoon everyone.
Search and other Google properties continued to drive great results with total revenues in 2019 of $98 billion and strong growth.I am also really pleased with two of our newer growth areas.
And it now has over 20 million music and premium paid subscribers and over 2 million YouTube TV paid subscribers ending 2019 at a $3 billion annual run rate in YouTube subscriptions and other non-advertising revenues.Google Cloud ended 2019 at a more than $10 billion run rate, up 53% year-on-year driven by significant growth in GCP.
Among their broader efforts our Other Bets Verily and Calico are also partnering with the industry leaders to use AI and cloud technologies to improve clinical trials, research and drug development.Our thesis has always been to apply these deep computer science capabilities across Google and our Other Bets to grow and develop into new areas.
We have recently signed a 10-year agreement with Sabre to help them improve operations and develop new airline and hospitality services.Finally, Google Other revenue.
Our home devices demonstrate how this vision can come to life in creating the home of the future with our new Nest Mini a Nest Hub Max, selling well over the holidays, following on from the Pixel 3a, which sold well last year.With Pixel 4, we continue to build out our capabilities and are keenly focused on execution, delivering great user experiences and broadening our distribution.
This will show up as more seamless products across various services and platforms like the Google Assistant, deeper partnerships and better use of our shared infrastructure.
Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release.Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, was $21 billion, up 17% year-on-year.
We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $120 billion.Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment.
Ongoing growth in G Suite continued to reflect growth in both SMB and enterprise segments and both seat count and average revenue per seat.The other revenues line now consists of Google Play, followed by hardware and YouTube's non-advertising services, mainly its subscription offerings, YouTube Premium, YouTube Music and YouTube TV.
Within Play, app revenues had strong growth, driven by an increase in the number of active buyers.Total traffic acquisition costs were $8.5 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 14% year-over-year.
As Sundar shared earlier, the non-advertising services at YouTube mainly from subscriptions reached a $3 billion revenue run rate in the fourth quarter.
We have been investing heavily in developing our capabilities in hardware engineering as well as building out supply and physical distribution chains, and we've created a multi-billion dollar revenue business in the past three years.We're looking forward to our acquisition of Fitbit, which will add strong capabilities in wearables and advance our vision of ambient computing for the Android ecosystem.
Your line is now open.Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystHi. I think this is the best Google call or Alphabet call I've been on since I've covered the Company.
So last year, we set up a core infrastructure team, which looks at things like how does the user journey work across, what does the shared infrastructure engineers can't use so that we don't reinvent the wheel in multiple areas, how can we commonly deploy AI across all these products.
So I think that's been a good example of bringing teams together.Another big area where we invested like that to break down silos is our partnerships.
Your line is now open.Kevin Rippey -- Evercore -- AnalystHi. As you think about the risk profile of some of your businesses like Waymo, like Verily in healthcare, how do you manage those risks, which likely in a scenario where autonomous cars have some accident or something like that, having those in-house and perhaps brand damage that could do to Google versus what you could do if those were entirely separate enterprises?
I'd like to start by thanking Larry and Sergey for giving all of us at Google a timeless mission, enduring values and an opportunity to have an impact on the world.There's a lot I want to cover today and I also want to leave plenty of time for any questions you may have for me and Ruth.
The growth rate of GCP was meaningfully higher than that of Cloud overall and GCP's growth rate accelerated from 2018 to 2019.Before I talk about the highlights of the quarter, I want to take a step back and give some early thoughts about my approach to managing Alphabet and Other Bets.
This means optimizing our usage of computing resources and also growing business opportunities in areas like YouTube, Cloud, Play, hardware and beyond.So as you can see, there's a lot happening at the Company and a real sense of excitement and focus.
Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers.In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles, including the impact of the Looker acquisition, which closed in December.Operating income was $9.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year for an operating margin of 20%.
In the fourth quarter, other revenues were $5.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube and Play, offset by declines in hardware.
What's exciting for us, as we look ahead at Search and other Google properties, is the ongoing opportunity to support users and advertisers with new ads experiences and improved measurement.Second, with respect to YouTube advertising, at a year-on-year growth rate of more than 30% in the fourth quarter, we're pleased with the ongoing strength and opportunity at YouTube.
Given our position as a challenger, we're investing aggressively, focused on building out our go-to-market capabilities, executing against our product road map and extending the global footprint of our infrastructure focused on 21 markets and six industries.In terms of hardware, as Sundar noted in his opening remarks, we remain focused on the long-term opportunity with ambient computing.
As we look at the near-term product road map, we continue to execute at a measured pace.In Other Bets, we are sharpening our focus on the metrics and milestones against which capital allocation is determined and we continue to assess where external capital is additive to governance and execution.I'll now turn to the investments we're making in headcount and in capex to support the growth opportunities we see across Alphabet.
As of year-end, we had $21 billion remaining in the program and are focused on executing on the remaining authorization at a pace that is at least consistent with what you saw in the fourth quarter.In conclusion, we remain very confident about the opportunities across Alphabet and in our ability to continue to deliver at the steady pace we've shown.Sundar and I will now take your questions.Questions and Answers:OperatorThank you.
GCP had fantastic revenue momentum in the fourth quarter, and as we noted it is growing at a meaningfully higher pace than Google Cloud overall.In terms of your margin question, look, I think our view is obviously the competitive dynamics in the cloud market are very different today.
Thanks so much.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerEric, I think overall I presume you're meaning across everything we do and if that's the case, I am -- I mean, the trends we are seeing and we've been investing on it for a while but applying it and actually driving use cases to users.
Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then on your second question, at our scale, we're pleased with the rate of growth in 2019 here in Search and our ads business overall and we do see ample opportunity ahead.
Thanks.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerDoug, on Cloud, I think maybe a few thoughts on some of the progress we made last year and talk about the differentiation, which you asked about as well.
So if you take an area like healthcare, all the investments we are making in healthcare across Google, and in some cases, Alphabet.If you look at Sabre, the partnership we can bring to them across our experience working in travel verticals as well.
Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd in terms of your second question, investing for growth and how we balance growth and profitability, the approach to capital allocation and the pace of investing continues to be guided by the same three drivers that we've talked about previously.
And then third, as we've talked about on prior calls, is investing to support operational excellence and that includes things like driving efficiencies in our technical infrastructure, which I spoke about.When we look at the biggest investment areas within Google, we -- as we've talked about already on this call, continue to be focused on investing to support the growth that we see.
To my point earlier, when people engage with us on cloud, they're looking for -- they're interested in a bigger digital transformation across the board.Google Assistant is a great example of -- because we are focused on the user and the experience cuts across several of our product areas.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn the question around YouTube, I do think there is a lot of opportunity ahead.
So is this an investment year in your view or just kind of more of the steady kind of increase?And then second question, on YouTube a lot of discussion here about direct response impact and the opportunity there.
",28.34,0.84263647
google,q1,2019,"Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search along with important contributions from YouTube, followed by Cloud.For today's call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes.
The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of revenues.Operating expenses, including the impact of the EC fine were $13.7 billion.
Based on the continued strengthening of the US dollar relative to key currencies, we expect a continued headwind to our revenues and operating income again in the second quarter.In terms of our key revenue drivers, with respect to Sites revenues as we indicated last quarter, the timing of product changes in ads at times can have an impact on year-on-year growth rates.
With regard to Google OpEx, the first quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long-term.
In terms of sales and marketing, the pace of investment in Q1 reflected a timing shift in spend and we expect these expenses to pick up in the second quarter.
In Other Bets OpEx, we are still early in the life of these companies and do plan to continue to invest meaningfully for the long-term opportunity.With respect to CapEx, the year-on-year decline reflects the purchase of a building in New York in the first quarter of 2018.
We continue to expect a sizable investment in both compute requirements to support long-term growth as well as in-office facilities.In conclusion, we feel confident about the opportunities ahead and we continue to invest thoughtfully for the long-term.I will now turn the call over to Sundar.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Ruth.
And then more to your question, as we indicated last quarter, the other item is that timing of product changes in ads can impact year-on-year growth rates and we make changes with the focus on the best interest of users and advertisers.
And so while YouTube clicks continued to grow at a substantial pace in the first quarter, the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated versus what was a strong Q1 last year, reflecting changes that we made in early 2018, which we believe are overall additive to the user and advertiser experience.
In terms of CapEx, just to fill out the last part, I think, of your question, relative to my comments last quarter that we expect the full year 2019 growth rate for CapEx to moderate quite significantly versus the year-on-year growth in 2018, there is no change in our expectation for the year on that point, either the first quarter last year, obviously, included a sizable real estate acquisition in New York.
But overall, we continue to invest meaningfully in our technical infrastructure, given our outlook for compute requirements to support long-term growth.
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo in terms of the Sites TAC rate, a couple of things.
And just so we can understand a little bit, can you just help us with the key user experience you're trying to solve for and serve the message to your advertisers who may be spending -- or maybe growing their spend less now, why that's going to be positive for the long-term?
Really, just help us understand how that Hardware business is important to Google and how you're thinking about it long-term?
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo, in terms of the mobile search and the Sites revenue more broadly, I think the main point as we've both tried to indicate in the opening comments is we view the advertising opportunity is significant, given -- in particular the opportunity with machine learning both for users and advertisers as well as our commitment to product innovation and -- being the backdrop of an environment in which nearly half of ad budgets in the US are still spent offline and about 90% of commerce in the US is still offline and we're focused on digital playing a bigger role in that and tapping into other marketing budgets by offering an attractive ROI.
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo in terms of the regions, the year-on-year growth rates reflect the product comments that I made with respect to the first quarter.
We're well positioned, growth throughout the regions, Sundar's comment on some of the things that we're seeing a big focus on the next billion users and excited about the opportunities across the board there.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd I don't think there were any demand issues for -- to the last part of your question.
We're excited about the opportunities ahead, we do continue to invest to ensure we remain well positioned for the long-term.
Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.And now, I'll turn the call over to Ruth.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Ellen.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which, we will take your questions.Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.Operating income was $6.6 billion.
Google Cloud platform remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet, with strong customer momentum reflected in particular in demand for our compute and data analytics products.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $4.5 billion, reflecting investments in data centers, servers and office facilities.Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets.
We remain confident about the sizable opportunity ahead to improve the advertiser end user experience through our ongoing commitment to product innovation in particular by leveraging machine learning across our ads, products and properties.Turning to the key drivers of growth in other revenues.
You'll hear a lot more from each of these teams throughout May, so I hope you can join us.We've always been a company that's focused on the long-term, willing to make investments that will help our businesses and our customers' businesses succeed as technology continues to evolve.
What gives us these opportunities is Google's position to help people, businesses and society in countless space through our products.Today, I'll start by talking about our core mission of making information universally accessible and useful.
As part of our Google News initiative, we kicked off the Local Experiments Project, working with local publishers to uncover new approaches to their business models and operations, so they can continue bringing great local content to the readers.AI's now spurring a new era of computing, which is more predictive and more assistive.
Recently at TensorFlow's Annual Developer Summit, we announced TensorFlow 2.0, making it easier than ever to build and use ML through improvements like TensorFlow Privacy, which helps train models with differential privacy, meaning that users' data is better protected.Now, on to our computing video and advertising platforms.
This year, viewership of Super Bowl ads on YouTube during the game rose by nearly 60%.More broadly, across our Ads business, our advertising product team led by Prabhakar continues to build new products for marketers with more than 100 enhancements introduced every quarter.
Lastly, at the Game Developers Conference, we introduced a host of new advertising solutions for developers, like app campaigns for engagement, which help developers reengage players with relevant ads across Google's properties.Next, I'll give an update on our Hardware and Cloud efforts.
Consumer package goods brands like Unilever, manufacturing and industrial companies like Samsung and UPS and public sector organizations like Australia Post.Finally, to support our customers' growth, we also announced the addition of two new cloud regions in Seoul and Salt Lake City, which we plan to open in 2020.
We also feel a deep responsibility to make sure that we -- that as we grow our business, we are doing it with minimal impact on the environment.Today, a Google data center uses 50% less energy than a typical data center, while delivering 7 times more computing power than we did five years ago.
So just wondering, if that's a wise way to infer anything about the relative performance of mobile search revenue versus YouTube from those cost lines in the quarter?
Was there any go to market changes in terms of the sales force or how you set quarter or anything that may have been effectively a Q1 seasonality issue that may see some snap back in Q2?Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah.
",27.93,0.52612484
google,q2,2019,"To make products work even harder for you, we have continued to invest in our hardware business, bringing together the best of Google's hardware, software, andAI.
We continue to build our world-class cloud team to help support our customers and expand the business and are looking to triple our salesforce over the next few years.
I want to thank Googlers around the world for another great quarter.With that, I'll hand it over to Ruth.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Sundar.
Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar to-date relative to the third quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the third quarter.As a reminder, FX headwinds affect both revenues and operating income given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S. Turning to revenues.
With respect to Sites revenues, the strength in the second quarter again reflects our ongoing innovation in part from the benefits of applying machine learning.
In fact, in the second quarter of 2019, as Sundar mentioned, the annual run rate for Cloud revenues was over $8 billion and Cloud continues to deliver significant growth.
With respect to capital allocation.Our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments.
And making sure, digging deeper to push our products to be more helpful is the main theme, by which we are evaluating everything we do.Beyond that be it, the focus on cloud has been a big part of it, continuing to scale up YouTube including being focused on content responsibility.
And so taking a long-term view, I think it will resonate on the monetization side as well.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd just building a bit of that question and the impact from some of the announcements that you've seen from us.
And really pleased with the ongoing momentum that we're seeing here.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn user privacy and control, it's always been a big focus for us in some of the things we recently announced.
And the key point that I'll just reiterate is that as much as there is a lot of innovation going on in the business and we've talked about that, we introduced product changes only after extensive testing and that means there can be variability in quarterly growth rates as you've seen.
And as we discussed last quarter, there can be timing variability and our view is let's ensure that we stay focused on the right things for the long-term and the quality that we can deliver.
Thanks.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo in terms of YouTube growth, just maybe to add a bit more there given your question.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn the first in terms of YouTube for brand, I would say it's more secular across the platform promoting higher-quality content, our work on brand safety, content, responsibility adds up to it.
And I think that's what we'll stay focused on as a company.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd in terms of GDPR, we did implement late in the second quarter of 2018.
We are very focused on investing to support the ongoing growth we see across Google in particular as we're talking about in Search while we're also investing to build new businesses most notably in Cloud as we've talked a lot about here today.
And as we both commented given the opportunities we see with the application of machine learning across the business, we are continuing to invest.
And finally, as we've talked about investing to support operational excellence.But the mega point is that we are excited about the long-term opportunity and we're continuing to invest which is why in opening comments, I wanted to make sure to call out what we're seeing with respect to ongoing investments and across the business the increases in headcount and the reasons for them at the benefits of those investments as well as sales and marketing and the fact that that is back half loaded and -- back half weighted I should say.
We are committed to continue to invest for what we see as a long-term opportunities.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd on the mobile question, we are definitely investing in Android with a focus on the next billion users as well as making sure the mobile experience continues to evolve.
And in terms of the next billion users there's a lot of headroom there over time and we are focused on.
A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerThanks Ellen.
Demand across our helpful Home products continues to increase as we expand to new markets.
Beyond hardware, we continue to develop the open platforms and ecosystems that push computing forward such as Android, Google Play, and Chrome.At I/O, we showed some exciting improvements to Android Q.
Moving from, YouTube to a broader advertising platforms, at Google Marketing Live we introduced new ad formats such as Discovery ads, which offer a new visually rich mobile-first ad experience across Google properties.
We also announced Google Travel, a new centralized travel destination where people can plan and organize all aspects of their next trip all in one place, from booking flights and accommodations to planning activities.Now on to our Cloud business, Q2 was another strong quarter for Google Cloud, which reached an annual revenue run rate of over $8 billion and continues to grow at a significant pace.
Finally Google Cloud's AI and ML solutions are also helping healthcare organizations, like Sanofi, accelerate drug discovery and as such, improve the healthcare experience and outcomes.
In Europe, we recently announced EUR1 billion data center investment in the Netherlands, as well as the opening of our Google Safety Engineering Center in Munich Germany.
Ahead of the games, we are working with the City of Tokyo to ensure Japanese businesses can better serve new customers and help visitors make the most of their time there using products like Search, Maps and Translate.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses.The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centres and other operations, including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues.
Operating expenses were $12.5 billion with headcount growth as the largest driver across each of R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A.
Growth in sales and marketing expenses also reflects an increase in advertising and promotional expense, primarily for the launch of our Pixel 3a lineup.
Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within network, namely Google Ad Manager followed by AdMob.Other revenues for Google were $6.2 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fuelled by Cloud with an ongoing strong contribution from Play.
G Suite continues to be a valid set of productivity and work transformation apps with the results benefiting from both new pricing and seed growth.
With regard to Google operating expenses, the second quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long-term.At this point, we expect that our 2019 headcount growth rate will be closer to the 2018 rate, in other words slightly higher than we originally forecast for a couple of reasons.
Can you give us a little bit of additional color on what's some of the key investments you're making, some of the key themes you're trying to drive after in terms of pushing the organization to collaborate on product launches and leveraging the strength within Google?
I think what's notable here is that every year at GML, we announced new changes to products and features and most ads product launches are introduced in phases as advertisers initially experiment with new formats.
And so I just wanted to add in here because while we're excited about the new ads products we announced to GML last quarter, given the offer great new user expenses across new services, we don't view this year's slate of launches differently from introductions made in previous years.Eric Sheridan -- UBS -- AnalystThank you.OperatorThank you.
Thank you.Ruth Porat -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes. So, it does include the entire business that Thomas Kurian is leading.
Growth in GCP was led by strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products and G Suite continues to deliver strong growth, as I noted in the opening comments, with the results benefiting from both new pricing and C growth.
But really I would reiterate what we said previously that we continue to see substantial growth in direct response.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd on your important question about kids' safety, as part of our content responsibility work it's one of the most important areas we focus on.
And then just second coming back to Google Marketing Live notwithstanding your comments Ruth that it take some time for products to be adopted.
And I was hoping you might provide a couple of specific examples of how the company is leveraging machine learning recently to help drive growth and improvements for both users and advertisers?
Thanks.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerFor us, machine learning plays a critical role across both the consumer user experience and part of ads too.

google,q4,2017,"Substantial growth in other revenues, namely hardware, cloud, and Play, continues the highlight the benefits of our investments.Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22.2 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.Network revenues were $5 billion, up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $4.7 billion, up 38% year-over-year, fueled by hardware, cloud, and Play.
As we've consistently emphasized, alongside the continued momentum in our advertising business, we are focused on building a second wave of growth within Google over the medium and long-term, which in includes the rapidly growing revenue businesses in Google cloud, hardware, and YouTube.With respect to cloud, we are seeing the benefits of a fully featured enterprise offering and an expanded go-to-market team bringing our advantages and infrastructure, data analytics, security, and machine learning to more customers.
Finally, as we look further into the future for our third wave of growth, we remain excited about the longer-term potential for our Other Bets businesses.Overall, operating income was up 22% year-over-year in 2017, excluding the impact of the EC fine, although there was obviously fluctuation in the rate of operating income growth quarter to quarter.
While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue will slow after the first quarter of 2018.Within OpEx, we are keenly focused on prioritization in order to optimize the resources we are investing for longer-term growth.
For 2016 we remain excited about the investments we are making to drive the next phase of growth in our big bets in Google and cloud, hardware, and YouTube, and our machine learning efforts, which are powering innovation across our businesses.
Our hardware is beautiful individually and as a family, and people love discovering the unique features like the built-in Google assistant.Earlier this week we officially closed our deal with HTC, which will bring great talent to drive even more innovation in the years to come.Turning to our efforts in machine learning, our AI research and innovation leads the world.
People love to use the assistant on all these devices.There was a lot of excitement around the Google Assistant at Sears from partners and consumers, where we brought the Assistant to new surfaces like smart displays from brands like JBL and Lenovo, as well as Android Auto, which is now available in more than 400 car models from brands like GM, Hyundai, and Volvo.One area that's really benefiting from our advancements in AI is photography.
In addition to the significant work, we are doing to protect users and stop abuse on the platform, just a few weeks ago we announced changes to advertising on YouTube, including stricter monetization criteria, new manual reviews for all videos in Google Preferred, and simpler controls for marketers.
Sundar, coming out of CES and the success you had with Google Home and the Google Assistant during the holiday period based on the blog post you guys put out, can you identify some of the key investments in either partnerships or hardware or capabilities that you're targeting over the next one to two years to make sure the momentum around Assistant is sustained?And then, Ruth, looking at cost of goods sold, that came in quite a bit higher than we thought, and you were lapping a one-time charge, if we have it right, versus the year-ago period.
So, I'm very bullish on it.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of the gross margins, it obviously reflects our product mix, and as you know well, the TAC rate for each of sites and network is a percentage as revenues lines does continue to increase because they are our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic and so carry higher TAC.
Third is CapEx, and we continue to invest in machines to support growth we see across Google but in particular, supporting cloud, search, YouTube and all that we're doing in machine learning.And then finally that leaves return of capital, and when we considered all of that, that's what led us to have the board extend the share repurchase program, which we announced a couple of years ago.
And, obviously, e-commerce is evolving a lot, and we continue to invest there.Google Shopping is doing well, and we work hard to make sure we bring the best experience possible, which is why as it evolves with search and Assistant we partner with companies like Walmart, for example, to make it much easier to buy products and so on.
Consumer behavior is changing, but we are comfortable given the breadth of how we do things and how we are focused on user experience there.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd on your question on desktop, there really isn't one particular item to call out here, and that's why last quarter I tried to walk through the process that our team goes through.
And then also on YouTube, anything around new products or features driving the monetization or ad business?And then, Ruth, just a question on the growth in marketing spend in the fourth quarter.
And then just related to that, are you getting a good return on investment from this marketing spend, particularly when you think about media mix and all the spend that we've seen on TV as compared to digital marketing?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn YouTube, we are continuing to see great momentum.
So, a lot of momentum there.Ruth Porat -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then in terms of sales and marketing, as I said, it particularly supported hardware but was also supporting cloud and YouTube.
Both Sundar and I have said these are important Google growth areas for us, and we are investing to support growth in the business.
And we just continue to be focused on doing the right things to support growth of the business.The fourth quarter does reflect the obvious seasonality.
And, again, we continue to look across the various products at their needs and try and prioritize, but we remained committed to long-term growth.OperatorThank you, and our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.Starting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter.
Specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers and other operations including depreciation, hardware-related costs for our expanded Made By Google family of products and content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube.Operating expenses were $10.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year in particular reflecting an increase in marketing spend given the holiday season.Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we place on this business.Operating income was $7.7 billion, up 15% versus last year, and the operating margin was 24%.
We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $102 billion.Let me now turn to our segment financial results starting with the Google segment.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets.
We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets.A couple of updates: Nest turned in a strong holiday performance in the fourth quarter across an expanded family or product in energy, safety, and security.
Both mobile and desktop search continues to grow and benefit from our approach to innovation with strong momentum as we identify additional opportunities to enhance the user and advertiser experience.
The most sizable catalyst for added investment in computing power include the expanding application of machine learning efforts across Alphabet as well as additional requirements for Google's cloud, search, and YouTube businesses.
After taking these potential investments into account, our board has decided to extend our share repurchase program up to an additional $8.6 billion of Class C capital stock.In conclusion, 2017 was another great year, and we are very excited about the opportunities ahead.
Google Cloud, which includes Google Cloud platform and G Suite has reached meaningful scale, and I'm excited to share today that it's already a $1 billion per quarter business.
I learned that this week.With all this great content, people are thinking of YouTube more as a key part of their TV viewing experience.
On New Year's Eve alone, over 3 billion photos and videos were uploaded to Google Photos.More broadly, we want everyone to be able to use machine learning for their own needs.
We launched major initiatives, such as total visit measurement and location-based ads formats to drive online to offline commerce.We have focused on making sure YouTube is a great place for users and advertisers while helping creators earn money from popular content.
Having increased both the number of products in the Made by Google family as well as continue to expand geographically in western Europe and A Pac, you can see that reflected here.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
And then, maybe too just as a follow-up, if you can provide just a little bit more color on Google Pay in terms of what might be different this round versus previous attempts?Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerMaybe I'm not fully sure I understood all the specifics there, but at a high level as people are on the go, they're traveling, etcetera, if anything I think search is more invaluable than ever before.
As we move from just answers to helping users complete actions over time, including transactions, their ability to complete the transaction is an important part of it, which is why making sure Google Pay in a unified way works as seamlessly as possible is a big part of our long-term strategy.OperatorThank you, and our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse.
But it would be getting ahead of ourselves to go further out than what we've laid out here.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive OfficerOn the video gaming side, I think we maybe today have a lot of momentum in these areas both with YouTube as a platform, Google Play.

google,q3,2019,"Q3 was another great quarter at Google with strong revenue growth driven by mobile search YouTube and Cloud.
First powered by our long-term investment in AI, we dramatically improved our understanding of the questions people ask Google search.
In September, we announced a landmark partnership with Mayo Clinic, using Google Cloud to secure and store data and understand insights at scale.
National Australia Bank recently added Google Cloud to its multi-cloud strategy to help the Company better use data and deliver new and improved customer experiences.Deutsche Borse Group, the fourth largest Stock Exchange Group worldwide relies on Google Cloud to help them navigate the twin challenge of modernizing their digital operations and addressing significant regulatory requirements.
We continue to extend our Cloud services through partners, including a new solution that enables customers to run VMware workloads on GCP for the first time.
We also announced a new Cloud region in Poland our seventh in Europe.Turning to Google's products that people use every day.
On a personal note, I was in Dallas in October, where I saw firsthand how important Google is helping small and medium-size businesses grow.
Our growth with Google program has helped train 3 million Americans in digital skills, including small business owners and entrepreneurs.
Sundar and I will then take your questions.Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment was $17.6 billion, up 23% year-on-year.
The biggest contributor again this quarter was costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues.
This line also includes the impact of hardware cost primarily associated with our mid-tier Pixel 3a smartphones.Operating expenses were $13.8 billion, with head count growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for both R&D and sales and marketing, which is reflected in both compensation and facilities expenses.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were again in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.Operating income was $9.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year for an operating margin of 23%.
Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 8% year on year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within network namely Google Ad Manager followed by AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $6.4 billion, up 39% year-over-year, once again fueled by Cloud followed by a strong performance from Play.Within Cloud, growth in GCP was once again the primary driver of performance with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products, complemented by ongoing growth in G suite, reflecting both new pricing and C growth.
Google accrued capex for the quarter was $7.2 billion reflecting investments in office facilities and data centers, followed by servers.
Within other revenues, in addition to continued strength in compute, Google Cloud saw substantial growth from data analytics as customers are seeing the benefits from implementing big query.
Obviously search is an important area, Image Search, YouTube, Maps are all great surfaces by which I think users come with varying degrees of commercial interest looking to discover and at times transact as well.
I have two, Sundar, there's clearly a lot of innovation happening at Google, but I'm wondering how do you think about the increase in scrutiny and oversay possibly impacting your ability to explore new services or new markets over time and ultimately to remain competitive?
In search, we made a number of improvements to make it easier for users to find key moments and videos, to easily find products with images via Google Lens and discover new podcast.Our hardware business is still in its early stages, but we are continuing to build the business and the portfolio of healthful products.
As a reminder, there is variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates from quarter-to-quarter as we've often discussed, we manage our business for the long term and not on a quarterly basis and we remain very focused on continuing to enhance the experience for users and advertisers over the long term.
Looking forward, we anticipate the primary driver of capex investment will continue to be our expected compute requirements, particularly to support ongoing demand for machine learning across our business, as well as for Cloud, Search and YouTube.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer of GoogleYou know in general, local is an important area for us and we are continuing to invest in building our experience that connects merchants, advertisers and users.
So be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Discover, be it Maps and that's the way we envisioned that and -- but small and medium business is a big area of focus and Maps represents a big long-term opportunity for us.Ruth M.
Porat -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice PresidentAnd just to add on there, given your reference back to GML, and I think we talked about this last quarter as well.
I wanted to ask another one about a new product, you guys announced earlier this year at GML and that was really Google Shopping and moving that across some of the different properties like YouTube and Image search and Discover.
Thanks.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer of GoogleIn general, I think it's a great opportunity for us.
Porat -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice PresidentAnd again, these are still earlier stage and it's, we're excited about the longer term impact, but just again make it clear, we're just still in the earlier stages of testing?Lloyd Walmsley -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay, thank you.OperatorThank you.
So things like planning vacations are assessing insurance options, what we see is users continue to go back to desktop, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile and I think one of the things that we've been very focused on is that innovations that benefit mobile also enhance the desktop experience for users and advertisers.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer of GoogleAnd then in terms of -- obviously we've been -- over time, we have developed a very comprehensive metric for measuring and tracking search -- search quality -- to get a sense of such quality in how user satisfaction is through search.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer of GoogleOn the first part, we consistently want to work and build products that benefit users and support the ecosystem.
Porat -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice PresidentSo in terms of the first question, I think as Sundar and I talked about, we're pleased with the strength of the business that you've seen here again in the third quarter.
You give us, I think some updates on monthly active users or DAUs in the past, any update there would be great or maybe any additional color on sort of how the total amount of usage goes on there is that's obviously been featured to users a little bit more.And then second, maybe just a follow-up for Ruth, Sundar spoke at length about your investments in renewable energy earlier and maybe keeping with the theme of the earnings call, you could help us understand how that is or maybe is not helping drive efficiencies across the country -- across the company and your operating costs overall.
Thanks.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer of GoogleDiscover is a product we are very excited about.
So these are -- we want to be helpful to users in a way that makes sense for them more continually and the combination of search and Discover helps us do that.Ruth M.
Porat -- Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice PresidentAnd as much as we're extremely excited about the long-term implications for Quantum Computing, part of your question there about our near-term computing requirements, given our outlook in particular across Google, we do expect to see ongoing demand for compute investments to support our growth, particularly for Machine Learning, Cloud, Search and YouTube.
Thank you.Sundar Pichai -- Chief Executive Officer of GoogleSubscriptions is an area we are definitely excited about.
As in the first and second quarter, the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated in the third quarter, that does continue to reflect the changes that we made in early 2018 to really improve the user and advertiser experience.
