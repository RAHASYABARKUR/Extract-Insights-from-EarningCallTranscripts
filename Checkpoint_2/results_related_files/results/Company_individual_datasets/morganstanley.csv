morganstanley,q1,2018,"In Institutional Securities alone, the dominance of Equities, the strength of Fixed Income, and the breadth of Investment Banking generated over $6 billion in revenue.Along with the rest of the industry, we recently submitted our 2018 CCAR plan.
However, as demonstrated by recent market dynamics, future activity may be impacted by regulatory, macroeconomic, and geopolitical factors.Our Sales and Trading businesses produced revenues of $4.4 billion, up 64% quarter over quarter.
I think what we've talked about coming into the -- throughout last year as well as coming into this year was a couple of factors that we suggested would slow down NII growth in this segment, and that's what we obviously saw this quarter.
We also told you last year that we thought that the deposit deployment strategy that we had in place was going to play out, and we were planning on diversifying our deposit and liability structure, which we obviously have done.What we have seen -- and, we talked about this last year and again this year -- our clients are deploying more cash into the markets, and they're putting it into different types of investments.
So, I think this is actually playing out as we expected, and it is going to be growth, but it will be slower.Sharon Yeshaya -- Head of Investor RelationsThank you.
What's the plan for how long that would stay on the balance sheet, and does this provide a pipeline for some DCM activity here over the coming quarters?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerThere's a lot of questions in there, and I would basically say yes to all of them, but let's just quickly tick off.
Again, within Fixed Income, there are lots of businesses -- macro, micro, corporate trading, commodities -- but within our SPG business, a larger percentage of that line item over time will be coming from these lending activities, and we've seen good growth in that area.
It does give us some stability, and we like the credit characteristics and the yield characteristics of that business, and we'll continue to try to grow it going forward.Sharon Yeshaya -- Head of Investor RelationsThank you.
I know it's an impossible question, but should we be expecting seasonality of the past, given the higher activity levels in those specific components this quarter?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerI'm glad you prefaced that by saying it's an impossible question, which means -- actually, I'm going to go back to Brennan's question because I realized I didn't answer the second part, and then, Glenn, I'll get back to you.
The flex is obviously how strong the markets are, reflecting the new issue calendar, which pumps up the banking, reflecting Equity activity depending on the div/of season, what time of the year it is, and then, obviously, Fixed Income.
A lot of that has gone away, so Fixed Income won't have the huge ups that we had in 2006 and 2007, most of which we gave back, but it's unlikely to have the kinds of downs that we had before we got rid of the physical stuff and restructured the business.So, I think the range of this firm is kind of a worst-case scenario without the market completely imploding around $7.5 billion a quarter.
Obviously, in a good market, a seasonally strong market, an active market -- all which we had in the first quarter -- slightly lower tax rate, slightly lower preferred that we have every other quarter, then you're going to be toward the higher ends of your ranges.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorI appreciate that.
The other question I just wanted to pick up on that was something that Jonathan mentioned in his remarks was the concept of the bid offer, which was up very strongly in the early part of the quarter -- I guess across a wide range of product.
So, there's things we could do, clearly, to drive returns higher, putting aside revenue growth, but what we're focused on is how are we going to do in a difficult market environment?So, seasonally, just add in the extra preferred, bring the tax rate up to 23% to 25% range that Jon talked about, and the returns for this quarter probably drop from 14.9% to -- rough math -- about 14%.
One follow-up on terms of environment -- now that you have $70 billion of loans, up almost 20% year over year, how do you reassure investors that these loans will stay of good quality?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, I think from the overall credit quality, there's a couple of components.
As rates rise, we'll also see presumably less run-off, but again, we feel good about where we are in terms of the lending growth -- slower first quarter, but as expected.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystVery good.
The volumes have gone up dramatically, so although there are different dynamics around voice versus electronic, we've been making up a lot of it in volume, but there is clearly pressure on the voice trading part of the business.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you.Sharon Yeshaya -- Head of Investor RelationsThank you.
On the non-comp side, we expected some lip with the activity, but maybe just some color on what's being driven by activity versus what -- you guys mentioned some of the investments in Wealth Management -- what we should be expecting as more ongoing.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, I think based on our expectations and budgets, we actually were right in line with what our expectations were on the non-revenue-related items, and then we saw a clear increase in BC&E, which shows up in the BC&E line, an increase in transaction taxes, increases in U.K. bank levy, and some of the other things that would show up in the other expense line.
So, anything around transparency around the scenarios -- and, that's one of the things that we're going to comment on, and I think Vice Chairman Quarles mentioned something about putting out the scenarios for comment -- any of that would be helpful for us to plan our business because we look at things for the longer term, and to get a surprise year after year based on the scenario does obviously inhibit some of that long-term strategy planning.Sharon Yeshaya -- Head of Investor RelationsThank.
Just a follow-up on that -- James, as you said, you've built more stable, you think stable, revenue-producing business model, yet when we look at the stress tests, you get hit the hardest in terms of starting point to stress minimum, in terms of loss rates.
Some of that this year is going to be a function -- as you know, a significant portion of our revenues and wealth comes from our fee-based flows, and if your markets are down 65% and they don't ever recover, that obviously has an impact on our business.The other thing you should know is all these tests -- we're not allowed to make any sort of management action, so we just watch all of this go on and have no ability to react to it.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd specifically on us, historically, we said the constraint was leverage ratio, and as the models in the Fed have done, you grow your balance sheet, then that's highly punitive.
Again, the way I would describe this -- first of all, I think you've heard James talk a lot about this business being ballast, so it's not going to move quarter over quarter sequentially very much.
It looks like you're gaining market share, so I want to understand what you're doing globally, but also in Europe in particular in this area.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, I would say broadly, Fixed Income was strong.
We remain appropriately sized to take advantage of active markets when they present themselves.Investment Banking demonstrated sustained strength despite new-issue markets being punctuated by periods of elevated volatility.
For the quarter, a combination of continued advisory growth supported by secular trends and the business' scale-driven operating leverage produced record pre-tax profit of $1.2 billion.
At the same time, we continue to actively invest in the business, building out our digital offerings, banking products, and technology capabilities more broadly.Investment Management again witnessed net long-term inflows over the quarter as the team continues to produce strong investment returns across both alternatives and public markets.
In the quarter, we closed the Mesa West acquisition and made several key hires.We've often said that wealth and investment management give us ballast, and our other businesses make up the engine that drives this firm forward in more active markets.
We believe we are sufficiently capitalized and expect to maintain our attractive capital return profiles over coming years.As we look forward, our objectives remain the same: To execute on our strategy and deliver on the medium-term goals laid out at the beginning of this year.
Our Institutional Securities businesses benefited from increased trading volumes and the return of healthy volatility across many asset classes.
Revenues were $2.6 billion, up 33% sequentially, on strengths across all products and all regions.Derivatives had a very strong quarter as episodes of volatility created significant trading activity and strong client demand for hedging solutions.
Our securitized product group had one of its best quarters in close to four years, driven by strength in Europe and a more active trading backdrop.
The increase was driven by higher market volatility and facilitation of increased client activity.Turning to Wealth Management, revenues of $4.4 billion were down 1% quarter over quarter as continued growth in asset management was offset by the impact of mark-to-market undeferred compensation plan investments.
On a year-over-year basis, non-compensation expenses were flat despite an 8% growth in revenues.Total client assets were essentially unchanged at $2.4 trillion, reflecting softness in domestic and international equity indices.
Fee-based assets continue to be a source of long-term organic growth for the business, supported by both conversions from brokerage and net new asset flows into the firm.
As a result, fee-based assets reached a new high of $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client assets.Asset management revenues were $2.5 billion.
Over time, we believe that these advancements will enable our advisors to provide better advice and service and broaden their client relationships.In Investment Management, revenues were $718 million, up 13% sequentially, driven by higher asset management fees and the absence of last quarter's impairment charge.
Although we saw outflows in our liquidity business as clients managed their cash balance needs around the turn of the year, our long-term strategy saw continued positive flows.
Investment revenues were $77 million, down by 31% relative to last quarter, impacted by lower market performance in certain private-equity-related funds.
This quarter's results demonstrate that increased levels of activity and client engagement are broadly beneficial to our business.

morganstanley,q2,2018,"Whatever transpires this quarter, we remain confident in the medium-term goals we laid out at the beginning of the year and are well on track with each of them.I'll now turn the call over to Jon.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, and good morning.
Institutional securities generated revenues of $5.7 billion in the second quarter.Continued strength across investment banking, equities, and fixed income has contributed to year-to-date revenues of $11.8 billion, our strongest first half of the year, excluding DVA, since 2007 and a 19% increase versus the same period last year.
In our macro business, we saw strong client activity in FX.Rates was impacted by range-bound yields in the second half of the quarter.
The initial phase of the redesign became effective at the end of the quarter, resulting in approximately $10 billion of incremental sweep deposits.This increase was partially offset by outflows in the quarter, primarily driven by taxes and a continued market deployment.
But we're very comfortable with our overall positions, Glenn.And when we think about our risk profile and our business mix, we like the business that we're doing, and we're very happy with the results.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystOK.
That -- in other words, you're not chasing hot CD rates.You're providing high rates to people that bring more balances to their Morgan Stanley relationship.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, certainly, the -- in the wealth management channel, the new CD promotional rates and savings rates have been for new money, as you said.
And I think everybody is kind of taking a little pause on that and trying to figure out what is the right level of capital you need in the financial system to fund economic growth and what's the right leverage of the institutions.
I guess, first question here just on the retention loans and wealth management, where, I think, the balance was $3.6 billion at last quarter.
I'm just trying to kind of think about the moving part here because I know it's important to the kind of the forward margin story.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerI'll try to take some of those.
higher rev, higher comp, higher sales and trading results, higher BC&E and transaction taxes.The one other area that you're seeing good growth is, really, I guess, from an FCC-disclosure standpoint, the IP and T line, which is where you'll see some of the impact of our technology investments where we continue to make those investments to improve technology, both outward facing and inward facing across the whole plant.
But the bank will remain a very important source of growth over many years and then our geographic repositioning, particularly in Asia, where we're investing stronger than we need to, for example, in the U.S. So a huge amount going on.We might not be making a lot of announcements about it, which is fine.
What are the goals from some of these investments?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. I would say that you've sort of highlighted what our expectations are.
And although we've made significant investments and had a lot of technological change within the business, these trends are going to play out over a significant number of years.
And probably more importantly, just how you're thinking about managing risk because it does seem more consistent than a lot of the peers in the industry.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, thank you for that.
We feel very good about the risk profile of the business.And it's really driven based on our client relationships and client activity and client flows.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.
And that's kind of an adjustment that I think and hope will be more appreciated over time in the way the models are constructed under the stress test.If you just look at the stability of that business quarter after quarter, it's pretty evident that even in very difficult markets, it remained stable.
So I think that the -- that change is going to be a net positive.But as we transitioned from the old platform to the new platform, we obviously were very sensitive to the customer experience and effectively slowed down that business.
Your line is now open.Christian Bolu -- Bernstein -- AnalystGood morning, guys.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning.Christian Bolu -- Bernstein -- AnalystJust quickly on the sweep changes that you've made to the deposit program, so, I guess, $20 billion, $10 billion from this quarter and -- $10 billion from last quarter and $10 billion going forward, is that it?
Or is there more that you think you can generate after that?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, again, from the redesign itself, that will be it.
So is the right way to think about that, you're going -- the capital ratio should be increasing over the year?
Or irrespective of client activity, you have the ability to grow the balance sheet and keep the capital ratios flat through the year?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. I think -- I mean, we have that flexibility.
And if there are opportunities to support clients and invest that capital into the business at a good return, we'll do that.OperatorThank you.
I will keep my remarks brief today when describing the quarter's performance, as the results are relatively straightforward.This is the second quarter the firm generated revenues in excess of $10 billion.
Investment banking and equities reported very strong results, and fixed income continued to perform well.Wealth management remained solid.
We will not get ahead of ourselves in predicting what the Fed will do next year, but 2018 appears to be a transition year.Going forward, we expect to be able to continue to invest in our business and offer our shareholders an attractive capital return, while maintaining a prudent capital base.
Year-to-date revenues were $21.7 billion, a firm record after excluding the impact of DVA in prior periods.Second-quarter diluted EPS was $1.30, ROE was 13%, and return on tangible common equity was 14.9%.
Investment banking performed very well as new issue markets remained open and receptive to corporate strategic activity.
Equity sales and trading was buoyed by active global markets, and fixed income benefited from strong client flow.We delivered solid results across Wealth and Investment Management, our sources of more stable revenues.
In investment banking, all products and regions performed well, generating revenues of $1.7 billion.The results represent a 12% increase versus a strong first quarter.
Clients remained engaged, and pipelines are healthy.New issue market conditions remained favorable in the quarter, with significant investor demand across both equity and fixed income, supporting strong underwriting results.
Clients in Asia continue to be active, including a number of large IPOs in the quarter.Fixed income underwriting results increased 4% sequentially to $540 million, with stable results across both high-yield and investment-grade issuance.
Derivatives and cash revenues remained robust, although lower in -- than in Q1 as market volatility and global volumes trended lower.Fixed income continued to perform well, with quarterly revenues of $1.4 billion.
Each business line saw a sequential decline versus a very strong Q1, but divisional revenues were up 12% year over year.
Net interest income was $1 billion for the quarter, down 2% sequentially, driven primarily by lower prepayment amortization gains.Year-to-date NII of $2.1 billion represents a 5% increase.
While funding in the U.S.banks grew by 2% to $70 billion in a seasonally strong quarter, as clients use their SBL lines to manage liquidity through the tax season.
A flatter yield curve has also shifted clients investing into shorter-duration products at lower commission rates.Consequently, transactional revenues of $691 million was down 7% sequentially.
Fundamentals remained strong.Our sources of annuitized revenues continued to grow with consistent fee-based flows and record balances for both fee-based assets and loans.
Year over year, revenue has grown 13% driven by continued strong investment performance and positive flows, particularly in our active fundamental equity and multi-asset strategies.
Our first-half results have been strong with two consecutive quarters with revenues greater than $10 billion.All of our businesses are positioned for growth and to support our clients if activity levels remain high.
Curious on how you think about the opportunities given your relationships with the sponsors and then how that factors in from a ""what you're willing to risk"" perspective.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.
Good morning.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning, Guy.Guy Moszkowski -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystSo let me just follow up, if I might, on Glenn's question about the deposits.
Just help us think a little bit, from a very big picture point of view, how you're thinking about deploying deposit funding, despite the fact that it's clearly getting more expensive.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.
But maybe there was some incremental tech invest.How should we think about that line as a jumping-off point from here?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. There's marketing and business development.
And we've probably made more strategic change to this institution in the last five or eight years than we made in the previous 80.We had a wealth management business in 2006 that had revenues of $5 billion and pre-tax profits of $300 million.
Are they getting more conservative, less conservative in that leverage loan business, please?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.
Is there any way for you to be able to take advantage of where -- at least where current market rates are and be able to either maybe extend duration or not even extend duration, just at current coupons to create a little bit higher yield in that portfolio?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. I would say that we're very comfortable with our ALM position.
",39.6,0.42826787
morganstanley,q3,2018,"The first half of the year was characterized by a strong market environment and increased levels of client activity.Commensurate with that backdrop, we delivered returns above the top end of the ROE target range of 10% to 13% over that first half period.
In the meantime, we remain confident and optimistic about the near-term prospects for a strong finish through 2018.I will now turn it over to Jon, who will discuss the quarter in detail.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentThank you and good morning.
And compensation expenses were $1.6 billion, bringing the year-to-date compensation to net ratio revenue to 34.5%.Investment banking reported revenues of $1.5 billion, down 14% relative to the second quarter, reflecting a normal seasonal slowdown in activity.
The growth in these metrics supported higher asset management and net interest revenues, contributing to the 2% sequential increase of total quarterly revenues of $4.4 billion.The business continues to demonstrate significant operating leverage.
Year-to-date results demonstrate that we can steadily grow this business, while continuing to make investments into tools to support asset growth, increase client engagement and improve cost efficiencies.In Investment Management, we saw continued positive long-term flows, $3 billion in the quarter, supported by strength in overseas distribution.
On a year-to-date basis, Asset Management revenues are up 13% on strong investment performance and positive flows, particularly in our active fundamental equity strategies.
We have seen a little bit more of a shift into the fixed income investing than we did -- probably what we saw in 2017, but all in all it's been a -- sort of both a nice way to supplement liquidity in the bank, but also bring in new assets to the Firm.Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- AnalystTerrific.
Are there any limits to thinking about further share gains, particularly in the financing side of the business?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentListen, Brennan, as you mentioned, we've gained significant share over the last four or five years.
Again, we try to focus on the net interest income in the wealth business and you can see that that business, the NII has grown about 4% to 5% year-to-date.On the first question, it's a good question Mike and we continue to make investments in the liability structure.
What's been the range of those cash levels, like over the last five or 10 years?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentI think over five, I would say 8% to 10%, but now down to 6%.
Your line is open.Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGood morning.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentGood morning.Matthew O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystRevenue obviously was strong this quarter, it's been strong year-to-date, it sounds like it's off to a good start this quarter.
And then if there's still further optimization that you can do to the CET-1 after going up 90 bps this quarter?James Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell, it's obviously -- it's kind of a -- apart from where goes the market from here, the second question is what is likely to evolve on the regulatory front, not just in 2019, but over the next three or four years.
Can you give us an update on the what -- how this impacts your business, maybe specifically in IM with -- like the investment line?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentSure.
So I think it will continue to see some impact from that, but I think again that's the sort of the tail on the dog, the primary driver of revenue growth for us in that business is going to be around the fee based assets.
Basically the businesses have been optimizing their balance sheet and their funding and that's sort of collectively the net result being the statement we made in the press release that the net funding costs are down, it's really based on usage, not rate.Guy Moszkowski -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystAnd is there any sustainability to that or -- just in terms of the lower funding costs or it was just something that was helpful this quarter?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentI think it was helpful this quarter.
Just curious on how big and what business that was?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentYes, that was a deal that was announced I believe in the second quarter, closed in the third quarter.
I was hoping you could give us some insight about how you think about earnings resiliency in a sustained market correction and given some of the commentary around the movement in cash balances, how much of an offset do you think that could provide if equity market -- weakness persists?James Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI mean, listen, we had a more challenging third quarter, both from market activity and just seasonal volumes, and we delivered an ROE of -- what was it -- 11.5% in that environment.
So we're not as correlated to equity market movements as I think is sort of believed, if you actually look at the stability of the franchise across each of the businesses.Now, clearly if you have a sustained correction, call it 20% every year, we're affected by that.
I was wondering from your perspective, how you think about balancing the need to continue to deliver margin improvement versus some of the higher investment needs as you look out for other growth opportunities.James Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes. Honestly, I think you're raising a very good point and I don't -- if that's the view of some people on the Street, I don't understand that view.
So how has dialogue gone, how do you convince or think about the stress test and how that impacts your ability to return even more capital, given that your ratios are dramatically higher than your peers?James Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes, Jim, it is the question and I'll start and we should spend some time and I want Jon to weigh in on this, because he's been pivotal to all the discussions we've had in DCM with our regulators.
As you kind of see that loan growth, should we except margin to -- can continue to move a little higher?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice PresidentYes, I think that's the right characterization.
And then just to follow up here, maybe good to get a little more perspective on just the investment banking activity levels in the various businesses.
We have seen a little bit of consolidation with MiFID going into place as people reduce the number of counter-parties they deal with, but I think the general comment was generally the top providers, top three or top four, top five, depending on the market, where the product have generally been gaining share and we would expect that that trend will continue.OperatorThank you.
And thirdly, meaningfully investing in our culture to ensure we remain an employer of choice for top talent and manage our business with professionalism with whatever challenges we face.These strategic choices were designed to ensure that as much as we can control, the Firm does well in a strong market (technical difficulty) demonstrates stability in a seasonally or structurally more difficult one.
Wealth Management delivered another solid quarter and Investment Management saw continued positive long-term net flows, although investment results were impacted by weaker emerging markets.We continue to benefit from the inherent operating leverage of our business model.
Year-to-date revenues of $16.7 billion are up 17% versus the same period last year, benefiting from active global markets, increasing revenue pools and stable to improving wallet share.
Activity remained healthy across products and regions with particular strength in IPOs. Americas was strong throughout the quarter, while Asia and Europe saw some seasonal slowdown in August before a strong September.Fixed income underwriting revenues were $508 million.
Increased results in investment grade issuance partially offset a slowdown in high yield financing relative to a very active second quarter.
Event-driven transactions remain a significant driver, supported by the active M&A backdrop and our ability to leverage our global franchise to provide holistic client solutions.
Sequential revenues declined across each business line as the quarter was characterized by low market volumes and more subdued volatility compared to the first half of the year.
And derivative results were also strong, aided by a diversified product set and client mix.Fixed income revenues of $1.2 billion were down 15% versus the second quarter.
Rates was negatively impacted by range-bound yields and low volatility globally.Our credit business saw a sequential decline on lower client activity across product areas.
Despite seasonal headwinds this quarter, our revenues remain solid.Turning to Wealth Management.
Net fee-based flows also remained strong at $16 billion, contributing to 3% growth in fee-based assets, which now stand at $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client assets.
In addition to the traditional decline in retail engagement during the summer months, we saw clients continue to focus more of their fixed income investing into shorter duration products at lower commission rates.
However, due to the impact of positive mark-to-market on deferred compensation plans, total transaction revenues of $698 million remained essentially unchanged.
On a year-to-date basis, transactional revenues represent approximately 16% of total net revenues versus 22% in the same period three years ago.This quarter's results once again demonstrate the stability and health of our wealth business.
Our supplementary leverage ratio remained flat at 6.4%.During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of common stock or 24 million shares.
",32.19,0.8194778
morganstanley,q4,2018,"The results of 2018 CCAR translated into a flat total capital distribution to 2017 CCAR, a position we believe we can improve upon going forward.Moving to slide five, stability is critical when markets are volatile.
The ROE of that business almost doubled to 20% over the last six years.On slide 12, the industry has experienced a secular shift away from transactional toward advisory accounts with service fee-based assets.
As we noted last year, Investment Management is a business positioned for growth and we're executing on that opportunity, as evidenced by strong growth in asset management fees since we refocused our efforts on Investment Management in late 2015.Across our business lines, we are seeing strong investment performance by management client partnerships and distribution and continued product innovation.
A key part of the strategy also includes inorganic growth, driven by new talent, team lift-outs and acquisitions in areas we believe we can deliver differentiated value to our clients.Taken as a whole, slide 16 illustrates the operating leverage of this institution.
We will be looking for similar bolt-on acquisitions within both, our Wealth and Investment Management businesses.Lastly, while not a point of growth, we reiterate that given our business mix and model and our capital base, we will look to achieve 100% payout ratio going forward, subject to obviously the regulatory approval and any acquisition opportunities that may come our way.Our management team remains committed to executing on our long-term strategy and fulfilling our strategic objectives.
In addition to the challenging market dynamics, factors specific to Morgan Stanley further impacted quarterly results, namely sharp losses to the investments associated with employee deferred compensation plans, had a considerable impact on transactional revenues in Wealth Management.Additionally, we made slight modifications to the Firm's incentive compensation, subject to deferral schedules, in order to bring them more in line with peers.
Non-compensation expenses of $1.9 billion increased 8% versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by execution-related costs and seasonality.While the difficult backdrop weighed on market making, client activity remained robust.
The compensation ratio for the quarter and full year was approximately 31% and 34%, respectively.Investment banking revenues of $1.4 billion, declined modestly from prior quarter, consistent with lower industry volumes.
We expect to retain our leadership position and finished number one globally for the fifth consecutive year.Fixed Income results for the quarter were weak against a challenging market backdrop.
Both seasonal factors and increased economic uncertainty related to growth and rate outlooks for 2019 and beyond, influenced markets, resulting in rapid movements in spreads and asset prices.Credit was impacted by a significant widening of spreads toward the end of the year.
And on a full year basis, asset management revenues increased 9%, a function of higher fee-based client assets, driven by markets and flows.Total client assets of $2.3 trillion in the fourth quarter decreased 8% sequentially, reflective of broader market movements.
Total US Bank deposits of $187 billion, increased 7% versus the third quarter, driven by higher deposit sweep balances.In particular, our bank deposit program benefited from seasonality and clients holding more cash in the phase of volatile markets.
Net interest income of $1.1 billion increased 2% versus the prior quarter and 4% over the full year.We expect 2019 annual NII growth to be in line with loan growth.
Increased lending penetration, the adoption of digital tools, fee-based asset flows and minimal attrition, indicate an engaged financial advisor population and a business position to grow.
Asset management fees of $628 million grew 4% versus the third quarter, driven by a significant amount of the year's performance fees being recognized in the fourth quarter.This increase was a result of the revenue recognition accounting rule change implemented early this year.
As we have previously said, this line has the potential to be lumpy, though we continue to see broad-based gains in our private alternative strategies.Other revenues were impacted by an impairment of a legacy non-controlling interest and a third-party asset manager.
While we cannot predict how these dynamics will unfold in 2019, we are focused on growing and supporting our clients and are prepared to respond to market environments with appropriate actions.Although the asset pricing witness at the end of the year will have an impact on first quarter results, markets have settled into tighter ranges and historical relationships have broke down in the fourth quarter have realigned.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Guy Moszkowski -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystFirst question, I wanted to ask was just, I recognize in Wealth Management, there were some moving parts that had to do with two different deferred comp programs, one being the one that affects both the expense and the revenue lines equally and we've seen that before.But it appears that there was another one that had a one-time impact on costs.
So, a new issue coming to market, the banking calendar being positive, clients see something that's attractive out there to participate in and they start getting moving and the advisors are calling them.
So, I don't see -- again, I've been doing this a very longtime and this is not a period where I would say you're seeing any fundamental shifting client attitude or confidence.You definitely have a very low level of transaction, which we've had for two years and it's got increasingly lower and even pushed into more money being cashed through the fourth quarter.
Pruzan -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey, Mike.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystI'm struggling with the quarter, understanding exactly what happened.
Pruzan -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think there's a couple ways to think about it on both revenue and expenses and also time.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWhy don't I start on this and let Jon talk about how to think about the institutional business and expense management versus growth.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystCan you guys give us some color?
And just what you're seeing in that market and maybe compared to prior time periods where you guys were involved in that business?Jonathan M.
Pruzan -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAgain, we obviously have multiple products, mortgage being one, the securities-based lending business, tailored lending within the wealth segment.
Regarding Investment Management, it's fair to say, we are positioning the business for growth, but it's still early days.On capital return, we increased our dividend to $0.30 per share, and had a buyback of $4.9 billion.
We believe that the stability of our team and business model compared to an industry, much of which is still going through change, should enable us to continue to take market share.Moving to slide nine.
Within the year, we saw patches of overperformance, as well as underperformance, obviously, in the fourth quarter.The net result of an 11.5% ROE, excluding intermittent discrete tax items, demonstrates that we're on the right track.
We are confident in this institution's ability to deliver both future profitability and performance at the levels that we've outlined.I'm going to now turn the call over to Jon, who will talk about the fourth quarter in detail, the annual results and then, of course, we'll take your questions.Jonathan M.
Although these factors are not material for the annual results, adjustments can be amplified in any given quarter and impact the segments in slightly different ways.Now to the businesses, our Institutional Securities business reported revenues of $3.8 billion in the quarter, a 22% sequential decline.
We saw clients derisk and delever in the second half of the quarter.Advisory, however, remained strong and we had our best quarterly results in over 10 years.
That said, persistent volatility and changes to sentiment could impact our ability to bring transactions to market.In equities, the business performed well.
Volatile market conditions, including the severity of intraday and intraweek movements impacted performance in cash and derivatives in the fourth quarter.In prime brokerage, the results remain strong.
We are critically and credibly sized for the opportunity and are well positioned to continue to support our clients.Wealth Management finished a strong year on a weak note impacted by the decline in asset prices and the impact of market volatility on investment banking revenues.
Overall, segment revenues were $4.1 billion for the quarter.Over the last several years, the impacts from our employee deferred compensation plans have had limited impact on both revenues and pre-tax margin.
The growth in annual revenues and the limited increase in non-comp expenses, while still investing in the platform, highlight the businesses extraordinary benefits of scale.The PBT margin was 24.4% for the quarter.
Higher asset levels at the end of the third quarter helps insulate these revenues against the market's decline in the fourth quarter.
Given the number of factors that can distort any individual quarter, we continue to manage this business with a long-term lens.
We would expect the margin to rebound in the first quarter, and we are confident in our ability to deliver our 26% to 28% margin objective in 2019.Investment Management reported revenues of $684 million, a 5% increase sequentially.
In fact, several years ago we just thought it was a little over the top and we were pushing too much, frankly too much revenue in the future years, which is mortgaging your future and not healthy and we adjusted that one time.In the last couple of years, with particularly our more junior employees at the sort of associate VP level, if you look at where they were deferred relative to the street, they were clearly an outlier.
And again, over a long period of time -- excuse me, over the annual basis, the deferred comp plans have generally been pretty -- have not really impacted the PBT.But we did obviously see a 14% decrease in the S&P in the quarter, and within wealth based on the mix of how those employees invest their assets in the deferral schedules, you saw a bigger revenue impact there.
And I would -- as I mentioned in my script, if you take those, as well as the seasonality as well as some of the volatility we saw in the investment banking or I guess in the calendar revenue, which you can see in the supplement, the margin would have been closer to the full year margin, had those impacts not occurred.OperatorThank you.
And backdrop on the traditional side of the business, we know that Morgan Stanley sold the retail component of its business and alternative world is growing.So, you gave us a look on check mark in each asset class, but can we sharpen that a little -- focus a little bit more and say, why now, what particular focus, and then maybe how you think about investing in that business versus say buying back stock at book value?James P.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah , I mean, if the stock stays at -- if the stocks at $42 or whatever it is, going to open up this morning, that's -- I kind of like buying that all day long, to be blunt.
Listen, the Investment Management platform is very interesting.We are, I think, as the slide shows, we have very good loan-only business.
We had very good flows into managed equities, which is -- and obviously the Street did not experience that, so that's a positive.Our fixed income businesses has typically being small -- not typically, it is smaller than we would like.
So, we plan all of those and if we can drop in a series of sort of string a pull type acquisitions across the platform, while we are driving organic growth in the actively managed, which is the high-margin business, we have better scale in the fixed income platform.
It's just something that given, obviously, the disappointing sort of stick at the price numbers of some of the stuff that it affects things like the margin Wealth Management because as I said, $40 million, $45 million is a point of margin.
I don't think you are going to -- we're not talking bull market rebound obviously.
On the other hand, it could be Morgan Stanley of old, where you had hiccups in fixed income like the second half of '15 or 2013 or during the financial crisis.So my question is, how much of this quarter, the fourth quarter, I get, you got your targets for the year, but I'm really talking about the fourth quarter.
I don't really see it -- I certainly don't see it as a B, which is Morgan Stanley of old, if you will, the sort of episodic volatile shifts, overdependence on propositions, big marks, misplaced trades, major integrations going on, at the same time, selling businesses, writing stuff off, it's not bad.
As I said, we had good client activity, part of facilitating our market-making businesses, standing in between flow and that flow was tough this quarter.
And again, we think it's a real nice opportunity over the medium to longer term to bring in more clients and more assets into the business.OperatorThank you.
And then I guess, specifically within the Institutional Securities, you've had really nice market share gain in the investment bank, as well as across the trading businesses in the past couple years.
Since some of the volatile, like line items, when I think about the institutional, business like the other line that credit flows through, investment line that was negative and then even the deferred comp, was there anything in the fourth quarter that was more like realized losses versus mark-to-market that if the market continues to stabilize, we would expect some normalization there?Jonathan M.
And we feel very good about sort of that book-of-business and being able to bring that to market assuming these conditions continue to holdOn the CLO front, as you know, we are an active securitizer.

morganstanley,q1,2019,"Across the board, ROE, ROTCE, the Firm efficiency ratio and wealth management margin are in line with or at the higher end of our strategic objectives, ensuring a very solid start of the year.Consistent with our objective to invest for growth, we announced our intent to acquire Solium Capital, a leading global software provider for equity administration, financial reporting and compliance.
Compensation expenses were $1.8 billion resulting in a compensation to net revenue ratio of 35%, consistent with last year's ratio.In investment banking, we generated revenues of $1.2 billion, a 19% decrease relative to the fourth quarter.
Strong non-compensation expense discipline and the benefit of the retention note roll off more than offset the effect of lower asset values, resulting in a margin of 27.1%.As demonstrated during the quarter, we have leveraged to protect the margin, while still investing for growth.
First question is on non-comp expense, we saw a pull back nicely here in the quarter.
Can you help us think about how we should think about the amount of flex that you have in that line to potentially offset environmental pressure if we see that flaring up again, maybe a bit of a context around fixed versus variable?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah sure, I'll take a shot and as you said, we thought we had a nice quarter on the non-comp side.
We did also see as you would expect, year-over-year a decline in some of the execution-related expenses given the decline in revenues, but again a nice quarter for us on the expense side, 71% efficiency ratio, well below our target of 73%.Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- AnalystOkay.
It, obviously, wasn't cheap on a multiple basis, so I see it as buying the technology and giving us access to a new channel with multiple verticals into it.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd then just briefly on timing, we would expect the deal to close shortly.
I mean, there's a lot of chatter in the market about the number of IPOs upcoming and I guess you get more than your fair share in tech IPOs, can you quantify, kind of what you're seeing, what's in the pipeline, what maybe a little after the pipeline for the period you compare this to?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerI will try to give you a little bit more context, although I think the adjectives were our attempt to give you that context.
That's a broad-based franchise that we're very confident in and as you know, given the sort of December hangover, the earnings season as well as the government shutdown, we did see a significant portion of the IPO calendar get pushed out, not canceled but pushed out.We also then saw over the course of the quarter increasing buildup of the pipeline in the IPO products.
I mean, the bottom line, the business has scale, a point margin on $4.4 billion of revenues, $44 million.
And the first quarter just shows the benefit of scale and our ability to pull levers and sort of manage between growth and investment.OperatorThank you.
We have a lot of confidence in that business and continues to do well.On the equity side, we came into the quarter with activity levels low and average balances or balances quite low given the volatility in the December timeframe.
I would assume there were some offset in comp, but if you could just sort of help with that?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerSure and I would say, you sum it up properly, which is that the PBT impact both in terms of dollars and margin is actually quite minimal.
And it's clearly a strong result, I just want to gauge how much of that strength is recurring and what we should be comfortable run rating in our models?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerThe three components on the MSIM, again, the fee-based revenue I mentioned, the performance fees and then investments can be lumpy.
It was fees.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, fees in general, there is -- we feel very good about the results, there wasn't anything particularly unique in the results outside of the investment management comments I made about investments being lumpy and the performance fees.
Or how should we think about the go forward here?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, it was a nice non-comp quarter.
I think the deal is closing in May. Am I right, Jon?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerSure.James P.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThere'll be some integration costs with that, some technology investments and so on, that's not, obviously, huge given just the size of the business, but that may bounce the numbers around a little bit over the next couple of quarters.
We have a $17 billion revenue business in Wealth Management that has nothing to do with Solium right now.
Jon, do you want to add to that?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerNo. I think your focus is right in terms of both Wealth and IM, sort of more of the fee-based type businesses, less balance sheet intensive, and that's really what the focus has been.
I mean, I think, first and foremost, I would just say one, there's just been less movement of people both in and out and that's good for stability of the platform, the ability to build relationships and continue to invest, so that's a positive.
But just talk about some of those dynamics and the flexibility you have specifically in comp, and layer the retention and the roll-off -- sorry, and the front ending of some compensation in 4Q?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerI'll try to take that in two components.
On the ISG side, you saw the comp ratios sort of consistent with last year's first quarter.
Thank you.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYep.OperatorThank you.
Jon.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. And again, I would look at the asset management space, it's not necessarily in totality.
While activity was not as robust as early 2018, the improvement in sentiment, CEO dialogue and Boardroom conversations are all encouraging.Our wealth business absorbed lower fourth quarter asset levels and delivered strong results.
We remain confident in the Firm's outlook and broader economic activity, but we're cognizant that global risks are more balanced.Against this backdrop, we remain very focused on expense discipline while still investing for growth.
Through Solium, we gained a new scalable channel and direct sales force, giving us the ability to target another client population, particularly a younger demographic in its wealth accumulation phase.On a combined basis, we will now have direct exposure to over 2.5 million individuals via Solium's Workplace Services complementing the over 3 million wealth management clients, our financial advisors already serve in our traditional business.What excites us is the expansion into the workplace, delivering financial wellness services to clients and offering financial advice, education and the ability to transact through their employer.
Still, the Firm produced solid results, revenues of $10.3 billion declined only 7% year-over-year compared against the strongest quarter in the Firm's history, ex DVA.On a sequential basis, revenues increased 20%.
Importantly, there has been a pickup in activity levels and pipelines are healthy.Turning to underwriting, new issue market conditions were more challenged at the outset, but issuance built momentum as the quarter progressed.
Revenues were $2 billion declining 21% year-over-year and increasing 4% quarter-over-quarter.On a sequential basis, derivatives and cash revenues improved with derivatives benefiting from improved markets and corporate activity, In prime brokerage, sequential and year-over-year revenue declines were driven by lower average balances.
While market indices have rallied materially and sentiment has improved, clients remain cautious.First quarter fixed income results were strong following the traditional seasonal pattern.
The market was generally characterized by tightening credit spreads, declining interest rates, low volatility and uneven client activity across business lines as well as benefits from structured client activity.Macro rebounded broadly on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
Micro results were robust both sequentially and annually, driven by particular strength in corporate credit.Tightening credit spreads and increased secondary trading activity resulted in higher client revenues.
Despite lower starting asset levels, the business produced a PBT margin of 27.1%, demonstrating resilience despite large market draw downs in the fourth quarter.Total client assets ended the quarter at 2.5 trillion, an 8% increase versus the prior quarter, reflecting positive asset flows to the Firm and the rebound in asset prices.
The 8% decline from the prior quarter was primarily driven by last quarter's lower ending asset levels.Total bank lending ended the quarter at $71.5 billion while funded balances declined slightly quarter-over-quarter, driven by a handful of large pay downs in the tailored lending book and a modest decline in security-based lending, commitments did rise.
The rise in commitments and solid mortgage growth over the quarter are encouraging and we continue to expect mid-single digit percentage loan balance growth for the full year.Net interest income growth of 3% to $1.1 billion was primarily driven by the benefit of the December rate increase and the corresponding impact on our investment portfolio yields.
Investment management produced very strong results, revenues of $804 million was up 18% sequentially and were the highest for the segment in over five years.
As noted historically, this line item has the potential to be lumpy.Total AUM of $480 billion was up 4% versus the prior quarter with long-term AUM of $321 billion increasing 7%.
Asset management fees of $617 million were down 2% sequentially, the higher management fees on the back of improved average AUM over the quarter were offset by lower performance fees.As we have met mentioned before, as a result of the revenue recognition accounting rule implemented in 2018, a significant amount of any year's performance fees will be recognized in the fourth quarter with a small amount being recognized in this first quarter.
Total expenses increased by 3% quarter-over-quarter driven by higher carry compensation, which offset a decline in non-comp expenses.Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets of $876 billion increased 3%, driven by client activity, primarily in equity sales and trading and ISG lending.
Markets in the second quarter have been constructive, pipelines are healthy in investment banking and higher asset levels will support fee-based revenues in our Wealth Management business.We are keenly aware that open and functioning markets and economic stability are instrumental in supporting confidence and activity levels moving forward.
And then switching gears to Solium, James, I know you referenced it and provided some high level context around how you're thinking about it strategically.
My guess is, it's primarily a Wealth Management customer acquisition tool potentially, but I would think that it might play in a bit on the banking side too particularly in developing relationships with privates.
So again, we feel very good about the mid single-digit guidance on loan growth and NII, even though clearly expectations around rates in the forward curve are different than when we started the beginning of the year.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystNow, thanks for that color.
I was just wondering if you could provide any insight into how much of that fee strength that we saw in Investment Management, transactional activity in Wealth and other sales and trading is sustainable.

morganstanley,q1,2020,"And they were natural consequences of the market turmoil, namely the decline in deferred compensation plan investments, and increase in the amount of prepayment amortization.Notwithstanding all of this, the firm generated $9.5 billion of revenues and an ROTCE of 9.7%.
And in the meantime, we will continue to do our part for broader society.I will now turn the call over to Jon, to discuss the results of the first quarter in greater detail, our perspectives on the outlook given the current environment, and then take it back where we'll both answer your questions.
In late March, we reached the recent low in balances as market levels declined and we saw our clients significantly degress.We entered the second quarter with lower spot balances down close to 30%, and a more challenged environment in Europe.
Higher asset levels at the beginning of the first two months of the quarter helped insulate these revenues from the subsequent market decline in March.
E*Trade will hold the shareholder vote this summer, and we remain on-track to close the transaction in the fourth quarter.Taken in full, we are very pleased with the firm's results and stability of the business model.
But there are several factors that will impact our earnings power in the near term, including lower asset values and balances, interest rates near zero, as well as volatility and economic uncertainty impacting Capital Markets and M&A volumes.The second half of the year remains uncertain and the path of the economy will be driven by the time it takes to resolve the health crisis and the impact of the unprecedented fiscal and monetary response.With that, we will now open the line for questions.Questions and Answers:OperatorThank you.
Where do we take hits across the various parts of the plant, and you're going to take them whether it's in the margin book, whether it's in the asset management portfolios, whether it's in the trading businesses and had it all of that look.Now, we didn't have a full quarter of being in absolute crisis.
And for this moment, we've come through that and generated $9.5 billion of revenue and that's net of the deferred compensation plans which actually puts us bit over $10 billion in revenue, effectively flat to a year ago, I thought was remarkable.Now, maybe it's my job to think that's remarkable.
But it clearly puts us in a much better position.I think our BDP, which is our cheapest source of deposits, which currently have a cost of 1 basis point is now about 65% of the portfolio.
And I think our deposit costs at the end of the quarter were about 56 or 57 basis points, and those should come down a little bit as we've just repriced our savings product down in light of the rate environment.So, I would say we should, you know, if we have the opportunity to deploy those deposits into loans, we'll see a benefit there, clearly.
Appreciate it.Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- AnalystSo, could you speak a bit maybe -- Jon, you gave some color on the $49 billion HFI portfolio, which is helpful, thanks.
It's about 58% LTVs to the top tier borrowers in the real estate business and we have good protection in the asset.So, the forbearance has mostly been, Brennan, in the CRE book right now, and then again, a little bit in the residential mortgage that I mentioned.Brennan Hawken -- UBS -- AnalystYes. Okay.
Really appreciate that, Jon. So, how do you adjust to those things and what levers are you thinking to pull on the expense side here as the revenue -- if the revenue environment continues to get difficult?James P.
We, obviously, and just the timing of all of the events, we updated our models for what was going on at the time when we got to the end of the quarter in light of what we were seeing and the rapidly changing sort of the economic outlook, which at this point, I would say, and James has mentioned it a couple of times, the range of potential outcomes is the widest I've seen in quite some time in terms of what's going to happen in the future.And so, we relied heavily on the sort of qualitative and environmental reserve and we looked at the downgrades, we looked at what loans we thought would be downgraded, the stress draw scenarios, we did some loss given default sensitivities, we looked at criticized asset trends and we've factored all of that into our analysis that ultimately led to the $350 million reserve build on the entire portfolio, or a 74% increase from our Day-1 CECL.So, the economic scenarios are going to impact people differently across the plant.
Our Retail and Wealth business had very little reserve build given the performance in that portfolio in the company.
But we think the qualitative adjustments that we made are appropriate and brought our reserves to an appropriate level.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThanks, Jon. James, maybe a question for you.
As James said, you're going to take businesses where you trade and put with your clients, there's the potential to take losses.
I know we got to deal with lower rates and lower asset levels going down, but I'm just trying to get the right context.
I'm just looking for the right big picture, your view of wealth management.Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, I think -- and James can jump in as well, but I've mentioned $500 million of negative revenue, so that puts the revenues in around $4.5 billion.
I was just wondering on the fixed side, any significant changes that you've seen in that business to try to gauge the outlook?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerAgain, it's very early in the quarter.
Jon, can you share with this -- I think you mentioned that coming out at the end of the quarter, in Wealth Management, 23% of your customers assets were in cash.
Over 90% of our employees are currently working from home as we continue to serve our clients globally.I frequently speak of the strength of Morgan Stanley's culture and our tenured leadership team.
With market function and liquidity essentially restored, clients are weighing the major factors at play, including significant unemployment and economic disruption versus monetary and fiscal actions larger than any others in history.During this period, the firm extended credit and intermediated trading, responding to client needs and supporting open and functioning markets.
We also saw approximately $13 billion gross drawdowns, $5 billion of new facilities in corporate lending and $3 billion retail commitments.We supported our clients by intermediate trading, including managing record volumes across voice and MSET.
Robust results in Sales and Trading were offset by mark-downs on held-for-sale loans, increased loan loss provision and lower levels of investment banking activity.
Non-compensation expenses increased 14%, driven by higher BC&E and transaction taxes on elevated sales and trading volumes and an ACL on unfunded commitments of $115 million.In the face of uncertain markets, we supported our institutional clients with insightful content.
First, underwriting activity was impacted as the global shelter-in-place action started to roll across the world, followed by significant volatility which dampened M&A dialog and announcements.Advisory revenues declined 45% sequentially, reflecting lower completed M&A industry volumes.
This was partially offset by an increase in accelerated primary offerings and secondary activity as we helped clients across the globe monetize equity stakes.Fixed income underwriting declined 11% versus the prior quarter.
Issuers continue to evaluate financing needs, looking to strengthen their balance sheets and raise liquidity.We have a strong pipeline across products and equity underwriting and a robust pipeline in investment grade and non-investment grade business, which are dependent on market access.
We would expect IPO activity to remain muted and we'll have to see whether other markets continue to open around the globe.Equity sales and trading is number-one globally and revenues increased 26% sequentially to $2.4 billion, with strong performance across all business lines and particular strength in Asia.Cash results were robust, reflecting the nearly 50% increase in global market volumes compared to the prior year.
The business benefited from higher levels of client activity and wider bid offer spreads.Micro revenues were more challenged and declined sequentially.
Strong commodity results were supported by increased client activity driven by meaningful swings in energy and metal prices.Other Sales and Trading increased significantly in the quarter.
Together, the ACL provision and mark-to-market, net of hedges, accounted for approximately $900 million of the aforementioned loss; and third, losses from investments associated with employee deferred cash-based compensation plans represent approximately $200 million of the law.Now, I will give some more color around our CECL provisioning for our $49 billion held-for-investment loan portfolio.
Client activity was extremely strong, reflecting high levels of engagement throughout the quarter as clients repositioned portfolios and moved into cash and other short-term securities.
Today, clients sold approximately 20% of assets in cash and short-term securities.Asset Management revenues increased slightly from the prior quarter.
Positive flows partially offset these lower asset levels.We had fee-based flows of $18 billion and generated strong net new assets at a pace above our historical run rate, highlighting the stability and health of this business.
Our growth strategy is working as clients are seeking professional advice during turbulent times, particularly with increased complexity.Strong loan growth continued in the first quarter.
We had extensive engagement with our global clients throughout the quarter and the business continued to see strong net flows despite the challenging environment.Total AUM rose 6% to $584 billion.
Total net flows of $57 billion benefited from a significant new long-term client partnership and our liquidity business.Asset management fees of $665 million declined 10% sequentially.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Christian.Christian Bolu -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystMy first question is on ROTCE for the firm, how to think about downside ROTCE?
I mean, given you are putting up 10% ROTCE in what is a very choppy backdrop, how should investors now think about the downside case for the firm is a 10% or close to 10% ROTCE now your bottom line as opposed to a couple of years ago what was your actual long-term target?James P.
Gorman -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHey, Steve.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystHey. I was hoping you could help us frame following the significant provision build that we saw in ISG this quarter.
And how do you see them bringing that down over the subsequent months or quarters?Jonathan Pruzan -- Chief Financial OfficerIt's a great question in terms of how our retail clients are going to reengage with the market.
