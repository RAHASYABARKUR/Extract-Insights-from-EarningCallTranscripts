bankofamerica,q1,2018,"Loans on a period-end basis declined $2.7 billion as consumers began paying down credit card balances following a period of strong holiday spend in Q4.
Liquidity remained strong, with average global liquidity sources of $522 billion and a liquidity coverage ratio of 124%.Equity decreased a little more than $900 million from Q4.
Global Market activity drove the increase under both approaches, but the increase was offset under Advanced by declines in consumer credit and continued roll-off of legacy mortgages.
The supplemental leverage ratio declined modestly from balance sheet growth but continued to well exceed regulatory minimums.Turning to Slide 6, on an average basis, total loans increased to $932 billion.
Global banking deposits increased $19 billion or 6% as we grew client balances domestically across all sectors of commercial clients and internationally with corporate clients.Turning to asset quality on Slide 7, total net charge-offs were $911 million or 40 basis points of average loans.
Partially offsetting this growth was the absence of NII resulting from 2Q 2017's sale of the U.K. consumer credit card business and higher funding costs for Global Markets.Focusing on net interest yield, it is flat year over year as the benefits of broad improvement in asset yield versus funding cost was offset by two notable factors: First, the Q2 '17 of higher-yielding U.K. card portfolio, and second, the impact from the lower-yielding Global Markets assets.
NII on an FTE basis and a comparison to prior periods was further impacted by tax reform, which lowered NII on an FTE basis by roughly $100 million.With respect to deposit pricing, overall interest-bearing deposit rate paid in Q1 rose 4 basis points from Q4 '17 and 21 basis points year over year.
We continue to reduce non-client-facing roles while increasing client-facing roles, such as relationship bankers and consumer business banking and commercial, as well as financial advisors and wealth management.As we signaled on our 4Q call, expenses increased compared to Q4 '17.
Consumer Banking's earnings increased to $2.7 billion in Q1, returning 30% unallocated capital.
Rates paid remained very low at just less than 5 basis points.Year-over-year net charge-offs increased $105 million as we continue to experience modest and expected phasing of our credit card portfolio along with loan growth.
Provision expense increased $97 million year over year.Okay, turning to Slide 12 and key trends, looking first at revenue.
Strong AUM flows over the past 12 months and a tailwind with respect to market appreciation once again drove strong asset management fees, offsetting modest pricing pressure.At the same time, brokerage revenue continued to face headwinds as volume declined and mix shifted.
While we were pleased with revenue this quarter, I would note that the market levels at fee pricing points were quite healthy this quarter and have since retreated.Moving to Slide 15, we continued to see strong overall client engagement in Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust.
Year-over-year client balances rose $140 billion or 5% to $2.7 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows, and continued loan growths.
Average loans of $159 billion grew 7% year over year and the growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate as well as structured lending.Turning to Slide 16, Global Banking earned just over $2 billion, generating a 20% return on allocated capital.
On a pre-tax basis, earnings declined 2% year over year, driven by lower investment banking fees and revenue impacts on an FTE basis of tax reform with respect to tax-advantaged assets.
As I said last quarter, optimism among clients remains high, so we continue to expect loan demand to pick up.Looking at trends on Slide 17, in comparison to Q1 last year with respect to average loans, the 3% growth was led by international regions and domestic middle-market C&I.
Global Markets revenue was $4.7 billion and earnings increased to $1.4 billion, returning 16% unallocated capital.
Equity sales and trading revenue at $1.5 billion reached a record of 38% year over year.Results were driven by increased client activity and a strong trading performance in derivatives.
Revenue and FICC sales and trading at $2.5 billion increased 13%, driven by lower client activity and less favorable credit markets compared to a very robust prior-year quarter.
Revenue declined $240 million year over year, primarily due to the absence of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business sold in 2Q '17.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerLook, Bank of America and the industry have not increased deposit pricing appreciably on traditional accounts.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerThat's right.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat's generally right.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystGreat, thanks a lot.OperatorWe'll move next to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
That comes down to practical questions of getting leases and things up and running, but if it provided a lot more pop, we might move it up, and that might cost a little bit more, but it'd be modest.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorI know a while ago you mentioned processing costs associated with cash and checks were pretty high -- if I recall correctly, somewhere around $5 billion.
Bove -- Hilton Capital -- Chief StrategistI think you've done an unbelievably good job -- a phenomenal job, I would argue -- in terms of turning this company around, but I'm just wondering because I'm going back two years, not just looking at one quarter, and I'm seeing that common equity just doesn't grow.
During the first quarter, we continued to play the role that our company plays and helped economies grow around the world, by supplying capital and through debt and equity underwriting for growth for those companies.In our company, we grew loans by more than 5% year over year in aggregate across the businesses.
While our market balance sheet grew to support our clients, our bar of value at risk remained stable year over year.The fourth tenet of responsible growth is to grow on a sustainable basis, and we did that by investing in our people and our communities and by driving operational excellence.
We're expanding those in markets where we traditionally have had commercial and wealth management businesses, and now we'll have a full franchise.As you think about people, our investments, and our teammates, year over year, we've added 1,500 primary relationship teammates.
None of these were material, and they are described more fully in our appendix of our press release and earnings deck.Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 5, overall, compared to the end of Q4, end-of-period assets of $2.3 trillion increased $47 billion, driven by growth to support Global Markets clients as well as higher cash balances from strong deposit growth.
On the other hand, loans in our business segments were up $45 billion or 5.5% year over year.Consumer Banking grew 8%, led by mortgages and credit cards.
Our reserve coverage remained strong, with an allowance-to-loan ratio of 1.1% and a coverage level 2.8 times our annual net charge-offs for the quarter.On Slide 8, we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios with respect to consumer net charge-offs of $830 million, or up $61 million from Q4.
This quarter marks the first quarter we have reported an efficiency ratio below 60% on an FTE basis.Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer on Slide 11, another very strong quarter for this business as the value of deposits, growth of both loans and deposits, as well as the investments we have made in people and our ability to better connect with customers continued to improve financial results.
Value of our deposits as rates rose, along with growth and client balances, drove the 9% year-over-year improvement in revenue.
Driven by NII growth, revenue grew 9% year over year, reflecting the value of our deposits and our relationships with customers, which continue to deepen as we expand capabilities.
Service charges were down modestly as a result of the full-quarter impact of the elimination of certain overdraft fees late in Q4.Focusing on client balances, on the bottom of the page, you can see the success -- we continue to have growing deposits, loans, and brokerage assets.
Sales on digital devices now account for 26% of all sales.Turning to record results in our Global Wealth and Investment Management business on Slide 14, strong client activity, a market which was up year over year, higher rates, and solid expense management pushed GWIM's earnings this quarter to over $1 billion for the first time ever.
On a pre-tax basis, earnings were down modestly year over year, driven by lower revenue and increased expenses from continued technology investments.
That's over now, by and large, so the growth that we're seeing in the underlying million-plus new cards we do every quarter and the usage by the customers and primary usage has been pretty consistent, and ought to bode well for continued growth, but it's really getting rid of the drag of -- getting rid of portfolios of the last couple years.John McDonald -- Sanford C.
We're just going to have to balance -- we're going to continue to balance the needs of our customers in the competitive market environment with that of our shareholders' interest, and we'll do the right thing at the right moment.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJust to add to that, people get focused on the rates, so as a clear statement for all in rate pay, for all our deposits, about 24 basis points -- obviously, extremely beneficial versus any other way to raise money in the markets, which are multiples of that.
But, people forget that comes from the value of the customer franchise, and so, if you think about the consumer business, half their deposits are checking.The CDs have been running off and are sort of bouncing around with $2 billion to $3 billion of runoff on a year-over-year basis, so it is driven by the fact that the core transaction accounts, the balances have grown over $7,000.00 per balance of checking account in the consumer franchise, and as we add more accounts and grow in these new markets, we're getting the primary relationship in the household, which means you're getting the transaction money, which is moving at all times.
On the specifics for us, if you use the last three years of scenarios, our stress capital buffer would be 2.5% because we'd be below the floor, and on our ongoing, forward-looking basis, we feel good about the stress depletion and the stress capital buffer because of the way we run the company.We're focused on responsible growth, loan to consumer, prime, and super-prime.
Does the branch buildout -- is that a net neutral to these numbers of $53 billion or have you factored that into that expense expectation?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThose investments are all factored in.
The bad news for you, Brian -- the tax cut was supposed to lead to a lot of loan growth, the higher rates were supposed to lead to much higher margins, volatility was expected to lead to much higher trading -- not from your guidance, but just generally in the market.
The good news is even with the dessert, so to speak, you guys still had some very nice efficiency, so if you could elaborate more on the record Consumer efficiency and tie that more to the 1.4 billion quarterly hits you had in digital banking and how much of the Consumer efficiency is due to digital versus branch closures or other actions, and where do you think that could go?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMike, you're sort of stating the debate that's gone on.
-- AnalystSo, do you still expect branches to decline even with all those branch additions?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt's always going to be a question of modest changes, because remember, we're adding the branches, taking them out, redoing branches, and making them bigger.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerOn a year-over-year basis, a lot of the increase in Global Markets was the result of client activity in equities.
In terms of the cash you're seeing on the balance sheet, yes, we had the positive growth, we saw some cash buildup -- with that cash buildup, a lot of it is for people who want to pay their taxes, so a portion of that cash buildup is going to run out in the second quarter.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerYou mean the quarter-over-quarter 4Q to Q1?Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Managing DirectorExactly.Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerIt's impacted by the growth in global markets, but it's also impacted quarter over quarter by the change in corporate tax rate on an FTE basis.
We're buying securities that we think make sense to balance liquidity, earnings, and capital of the company in all sorts of market environments.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMarty, just to be simple, we're not going to take losses in the current period to hit equity and reposition the portfolio.
So, strategically, think about that shift and what that means going forward.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell, what it doesn't mean is that we're not delivering mortgage loans for our customers and home equity loans.
But, it's immaterial for financial reporting and the context of $23 billion in revenue a quarter, but it's not immaterial in the minds of our Consumer customers and our Wealth Management customers, and there, you can see that we continue to drive our mortgage capabilities through it, including introducing a digital mortgage product this quarter that I think is going to be the best in the industry.Paul M.
I think you're seeing the benefit of that in loan growth generally, but certainly in C&I.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBrian, one thing I'd say is we have done a good job in the small business segment and the business banking, which is $50-million-and-under-revenue companies for business banking and $5-million-and-under for small business.
I think in small business this quarter, year over year, we had a 9% growth in loan balances, and in business banking, we probably had mid-single digits.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerThe balances have been declining for many quarters as people shifted to AUM, and this was the first time in two years that balances were actually up.
Remember, balances go up because the market goes up, balances go up because of flows, and the combination of those two things -- for the first time in many quarters -- saw an increase.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAgain, similar to the small-business/business banking relative to the commercial, underneath, the Merrill Edge piece -- which is geared at the mass-affluent market segment -- had record flows and is growing 18% or 20% year over year.
At some point, given the fact that assets do grow, that market capitalization does grow, common equity is going to have to grow, and I don't know when that is.But, the second question is we've seen -- again, looking longer-term, going back to the fourth quarter of 2015 -- something like a 165-basis-point increase in the overnight rate, and the net interest margin of the bank is up 25 basis points.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, we told you that versus last year first quarter, it had been up 12 basis points, but we sold a portfolio of higher-yielding cards.
Would it take a capital hit at this point, or are there not buyers, or do you just think it's better to work these things out over time?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell, we've taken all approaches.

bankofamerica,q2,2018,"This quarter marks the 11th straight quarter where Bank of America has grown its average deposits more than $40 billion on a year-over-year quarter comparison basis.We added more credit cards, we added more checking accounts on the consumer side, and we added more accounts and households in our Merrill Edge online brokerage.
In fact, the charge-off ratio has been below 50 basis points for 14 of the last 17 quarters.In Global Markets, we continue to see a strong return on our lower-value risk metric than many of our peers, all while continuing to generate growth and improve profitability.
Here, we display the results, and typically, Paul will cover these as part of the Consumer Banking dialogue, but I think it's important to understand how responsible growth and driving sustainable operating leverage works.
Provision expense was $827 million, $101 million higher than Q2 '17, driven primarily by the seasoning of our credit card portfolio, loan growth, and a modestly lower reserve release.Brian already covered the significant improvement in returns seen on this slide.
If you look at the first half of the year, we issued $3.7 billion of lower-yielding preferred stock ahead of redemptions of $2.8 billion of higher-yielding preferred stock, and note we have called another $900 million that we'll settle in the third quarter.Given a $1 billion decline in the value of AFS securities, which impacts OCI, common equity decreased by $0.5 billion as we returned 90% of net income earned in the quarter to our shareholders via dividends and repurchases.
Total loan growth continued to be impacted by the runoff of non-core consumer real estate loans.On the other hand, loans in our business segments were up $45 billion or 5% year over year.
Compared to Q1 '18, the increase was driven by commercial bouncing around the bottom.Our reserve coverage remained strong, with an allowance-to-loan ratio of 1.08% and a coverage level 2.6 times our annual net charge-offs for the quarter.On Slide 10, we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios.
This growth is even more impressive given Q2 '17 included $140 million of NII from the U.K. card business, which we sold in June of last year.Note we have presented the net interest yield excluding the impact of net interest income and related assets associated with our Global Markets segment.
For example, women make up 45% of these interns, and 55% are ethnically or racially diverse.Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 13, another great quarter for this business as client balances grew, revenues increased, and expenses were down.
Provision expense increased $110 million from Q2 '17, in line with the increase in net charge-offs.Turning to Slide 14 and key trends, looking first at revenue, we believe relationship deepening is driving improvement in revenue, predominantly NII.
Customer satisfaction in Consumer Banking reached a new high, with roughly 81% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale.Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, we continued to grow deposits, loans, and brokerage assets.
Absent the impact of tax reform, the business would have created modest revenue growth and operating leverage.IBCs of $1.4 billion for the overall firm declined 7% year over year, driven by lower advisory fees from a record quarter a year ago.
So, I would expect that kind of a range as you look out the next couple of quarters, and that would reflect seasoning and loan growth in the card portfolio in that number.John McDonald -- Sanford C.
So, I want to ask an NII question, and I saw the comments on ex Global Markets, the net interest yield being up 12 basis points, deposit betas are good, so the core business that we all focus on is good.
Page 9 of the supplement has the average balances.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerJust think of it -- it's a matched book, so it moves together pretty quickly due to the fact it's all short term, both on the liability side, and then, they're long assets, but they price up as the curve moves.
Next quarter, you might see it settle in a little bit more like it traditionally does.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorOkay, that's good, because the flattening out on total net interest income is really that as opposed to the core business.
And so, we had a record quarter in the second quarter last year, and so, the $1.4 billion-ish level is more in line with second quarters across time, but the team knows they can do a better job, and they're after it.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorAll right, thank you.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
On card, we've seen mid-single-digit year-over-year growth, which has modestly increased over the past couple of quarters.With respect to consumer real estate, originations are solid and balances are growing well, but there are headwinds continuing from the runoff of the non-core portfolio, and remember, we're booking 90% of our mortgages now on the balance sheet.
If you look at this quarter, we saw really good growth in small business, we saw good growth in structured lending and GWIM, so in any quarter, we might see growth, but it's always seemed to average out at that mid-single-digit level.Jim Mitchell -- Buckingham Research -- AnalystOkay, and in that context, as we think about deposit growth slowing -- I don't know if it's a large impact from the TruPS and your rate sensitivity -- how do we think about NII growth going forward given the implied curve today?Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, most of the deposit growth in Global Banking has been in interest-bearing deposits, so we are definitely seeing a shift there from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBut, it's very different by business.
So, in the business banking segment, it's 5 to 1 non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing, and when you get to corporate, it's more interest-bearing than non-interest-bearing, so again, it differs by the type of customer it is, too.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorOkay, but I guess part of the point you're making is that that's in the run rate already.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, and the point is that you'll see -- to go back since the tightening started in '15 and think about the global scheme of things, you can see that tightening moves across that, you've seen what's happened with the deposit rates.
They'll continue to move, but you've backed out and played through it all, you still see the asset sensitivity at just under $3 billion for a 100-basis-point rise, 70% is in the short term, and that takes all the stuff we're talking about and puts it into the forward curve assumption.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorAnd, the checking accounts that you're growing on the consumer side -- do you see that more in your branch expansion areas, or is that more in your legacy -- for lack of a better word -- legacy footprint?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt has to be in the legacy because the expansion footprint is so small.
If I could follow up a little bit more on that lower right part of the funding side -- Paul, can you walk us through the benefits you expect from trust-preferred redemption, and if you are going to refinance that, and what would be the net benefit as you think about that and forward NII?Paul M.
Is that how we should think about it?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think there's lots of trade-offs consumers make, but this is the money going in and out of their checking account on a given day, so if you're growing it, the average balance of $7,500.00 -- between our preferred and our retail segment, they'd be different each segment, but this is money in motion, for lack of a better term, Mike, as you're thinking about it.
Should we expect that to stay at 48%, or can you improve a lot more, and if so, where?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerLook, we never -- Mike, as you know, we don't sit there and say, ""48% is great and let's stop."" And so, I think if you look at that, they'll continue to work to improve it.
A little bit of that on the same expense base makes a heck of a turn, and if you think about it, 850 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year matched quarter is pretty effective.So, it's a combination of all those investments I talked about earlier coming true and the efficiency embedded in that, a combination of more sales digital and efficiency embedded in the sales process because this 48% counts everything, and a combination of continuing to grow checking accounts and the deposit balances, which are the highest potential revenue growth product for them in the short term with a big business like that.
Your marketing spend did not increase, at least in contrast to some of your peers, and the thought there is as you relate to customers less with branches, more digital, maybe you want more support from a marketing standpoint, but that, at least, is not showing through in your expense numbers.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah.
But, all told, I think it's about 35-40% of the sales transaction initiated by a marketing lead, for lack of a better term, driven by analytics into the branch system or into the digital experience.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystAll right, thank you.OperatorAnd, we'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerLook, in Q2 '17, we did have a small non-operating charge, so I wouldn't use this quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year growth rate as the growth rate going forward.
If you look more generally, we're seeing growth in our card balances, and we think that's going to continue in 2018.
So, all that together is a more complex thing, but at the end of the day, you put it all together, we made $2.8 billion after tax, 48% efficiency ratio, deposits grew by $35 billion year over year, $26 billion of which was checking, to give you a sense, which relies on all those great capabilities to fuel it and why we think we're taking share.Nancy Bush -- NAB Research -- OwnerSo, I guess what you're saying -- there has been a tendency in the industry to look at digital versus branch as sort of an either/or proposition, and you're saying that that's not necessarily correct at this point.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, because a half million people went to their mobile device, set up an appointment, came in the branch, another million responded to calls, and 50 million people walked in, and yet, we had 1.4 billion logins.
Are we in a new environment that's something we haven't seen before, where it's just consistent?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell, we could never -- we are a bank, Nancy, as you well know, and therefore, the general economy is always going to have an impact.
Good morning, Paul.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe missed you the first time, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystI know.
And, of course, while it's true that tax reform is benefiting our bottom line as well as corporations around America, income before taxes also grew and second-quarter reported pre-tax income improved 5% year over year, but after adjusting for some select items, which Paul is going to cover later, a better way to look at it is pre-tax income is up 11%.Our balance sheet from both a capital and liquidity standpoint remains extremely strong.
Our immediate priority remains to use capital to buy back shares that we don't need for business growth, but importantly, we increased our dividend by 25%.Our responsible growth strategy continues to work, growing earnings returns and capital returns, and doing so the right way.
Before I review comparative period performance, let me remind you of a few select items which I think are helpful in understanding our operating performance.In Q2 '17, we had a net after-tax gain from the sale of our U.K. card consumer business of roughly $100 million, which included a revenue benefit of nearly $800 million in other income, mostly offset by a tax cost of nearly $700 million.
We would expect the tax rate to be roughly 21% in the second half of 2018 absent unusual items.Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 7, overall, compared with the end of Q1, end-of-period assets of $2.3 trillion decreased $37 billion, driven by lower Global Markets assets as well as lower deposit levels, primarily due to seasonal customer tax payments.
We're seeing aggressive terms in structure; however, we remained disciplined, and from a consistency standpoint, as you can see in the bottom right chart, loan growth in our business segment has been mid-single-digit consistently for several years now.This chart compares year-over-year growth over the past five quarters.
Global banking deposits were strong, growing 8%, and included movement from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing.Turning to asset quality on Slide 9, total net charge-offs were $996 million or 43 basis points of average loans and increased as expected.
Excluding the storm-related losses, the credit card loss rate increased 22 basis points from Q2 '17.Consumer NPLs of $4.6 billion declined 5% from Q1 and 47% of our consumer NPLs remain current on their payments.
The net interest yield excluding Global Markets increased 12 basis points year over year to 2.95%, driven by broad improvement in asset yields relative to funding costs.Moving back to total NII, Q2 GAAP NII increased modestly versus Q1, as the benefits of higher interest rates and one extra day was offset by seasonal client activity in Global Markets and seasonal paydowns of credit card loans.
As I mentioned earlier, Q2 '17 included roughly $300 million in impairment associated with data centers that we sold, so, excluding that charge, expense still declined nearly $400 million or 3% with broad improvements across most categories, and I would emphasize that we achieved this reduction while continuing to invest in new technology, new financial centers, and sales staff.With respect to sales professionals, we continue to add relationship bankers in consumer, business banking, and commercial, as well as financial advisors in wealth management, and notably, despite adding sales professionals, our headcount is down roughly 3,000 from last year as we reduce non-client-facing roles by streamlining how we work and deliver for customers.
These types of improvements are fueling higher spending and more borrowing, and we believe we are gaining share and deepening relationships in this growing economy.Earnings in Consumer Banking increased to $2.9 billion, returning 31% on allocated capital.
Consumer Banking created over 850 basis points of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 8% while expenses were down.
Whether it is access to one of our 4,000 licensed advisors and a world-leading research platform or how integrated Edge is with other banking needs, we think customers are noticing and giving us more of their investment dollars.Expenses were down slightly compared to Q2 '17 as productivity improvements more than offset the continued investment in financial center renovations and technology initiatives.
This quarter, we opened 13 new financial centers and renovated another 65.Okay, turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 15, GWIM produced another quarter of solid results, nearing the record $1 billion of net income earned in Q1 and producing the second-highest pre-tax margin ever at 28%.
Strong client activity and a healthy equity market coupled with solid expense management all benefited the results.
Growth in households and deepening of relationships is helping offset industry dynamics driven by consumer behaviors.Strong AUM flows and market appreciation increased AUM balances, driving a 10% increase in asset management fees.
The business managed costs well, creating operating leverage.Moving to Slide 16, we continue to see strong overall client engagement in Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust.
Year-over-year client balances rose to record levels of nearly $2.8 trillion driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows, and continued loan growth.
Average loans of $161 billion grew 7% year over year with continued strength in consumer real estate and structured lending.Turning to Slide 17, Global Banking earned just over $2 billion, growing 16% from Q2 '17 and generating a 20% on allocated capital.
Earnings were up 35% as revenue growth outpaced expense increases from higher revenue-led costs and continued technology investments.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerAre you talking about the increase in the cost of our long-term debt quarter over quarter?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo, Fed funds.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorFed funds on the wholesale funding side.
It's not coming from CDs or other types of high-cost deposits -- driving the total deposit growth.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystAnd then, Consumer Banking efficiency ratio of 48% -- I'm not sure if that's the lowest in history, but maybe that's good news/bad news.
We're focused on attracting relatively high-quality card customers and rewarding them for deepening their overall relationship with us, and we think that strategy is driving incremental deposit growth, making our deposits more sticky, and it also lowers our cost because those people tend to interact less with the bank.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Managing DirectorOkay, thank you.OperatorWe'll go next to Saul Martinez with UBS.
Please go ahead.Saul Martinez -- UBS Group -- Managing DirectorHey, good morning.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Saul Martinez -- UBS Group -- Managing DirectorOn NII, Paul, obviously, part of the lack of clarity around the NII guide is in part due to the uncertainty around retail deposit beta and on the consumer side, where you haven't seen much of anything in terms of deposit rates moving up, but is there anything that gives you pause, that we are nearing a tipping point?

bankofamerica,q3,2018,"This capital return allowed us to reduce our share count by over 5% year over year and grow EPS faster than earnings.So, beginning on Slide 2, during the third quarter, our 200,000-plus teammates did a great job for you, our shareholders.
The value of our deposit franchise is showing both in our NII and our net interest yield improvement, and Paul is gonna take you through the details on that later.Our balance sheet from both a capital and liquidity standpoint remains very strong, allowing us to pay $4 billion in common dividends year to date and spend $15 billion to reduce our share count in the same period.
We have now doubled those assets twice in the past eight years, with plenty of room ahead for future growth.Overall, our client balances within our Wealth Management business -- the best business there is in the world -- exceeded $2.8 trillion.
This discipline, combined with great customer work, produces operating leverage.As we go to Slide 3, in 2015 and 2016, some of you also questioned whether we could drive operating leverage, were expenses attributable to run-off activities, or were they not generating enough revenue?
In our Wealth Management business, we are rolling out a sleeker Merrill Lynch digital platform with more integration between banking and investing, along with adding industry-leading capabilities of market data, enhanced documents, scanning, and texting capabilities between our advisors and our clients.In Global Banking, we enabled additional cash pro digital capabilities, giving CFOs and treasurers more mobile capabilities and insights to see and move cash at their companies, just as our consumers do.
NPLs, reservable criticized exposure, and delinquencies all declined, while net charge-offs were up $32 million year over year, mostly from seasoning of our credit card portfolio and loan growth.
These transactional accounts -- i.e., consumer non-interest-bearing and low-interest checking accounts -- are the most valuable types of accounts, and these two account categories combined have grown every quarter since 2012, and just since 2015, as shown here, have grown at a compounded annual rate of 9%.We believe this pace of growth and the aggregated level of these account categories is demonstrably better than the market.
This leadership reflects the value customers see in not only our deposit capabilities, but also their total relationship with us, including preferred relationship rewards, simple, transparent products, lower service charges, improved customer service, enhanced mobile capabilities, and improved physical centers.Turning to Slide 8, total loans on an average basis were $931 billion.
As Brian mentioned, competition for commercial loans remains intense, accommodating capital markets are a receptive alternative to bank loans, non-bank lenders have likely increased their market share, and companies remain flush with cash and are generating solid earnings.
Provision expense included a $216 million net reserve release, reflecting improvement in our consumer real estate and energy portfolios as well as other more broad-based commercial improvements.Turning to Slide 10, we break out credit quality metrics on both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios.
Higher interest rates and deposit growth also drove the linked-quarter improvement, aided by an additional day of interest.Net interest yield improved 6 basis points year over year and 4 basis points linked quarter.
In fact, if you recall, Brian mentioned last quarter that we increased our budgets for new initiative spending starting this quarter by $75 million per quarter through the end of 2019.Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 13, another outstanding quarter for this segment as client balances grew, revenues increased, and expenses were down.
Consumer Banking created nearly 1,000 basis points of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 7% while expenses were down 2%.Engagement with customers was strong.
Customer satisfaction in consumer banking reached a new high with more than 80% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale.This improvement in customer satisfaction is clearly an important factor, driving the strong growth in customer balance, as I mentioned a moment ago, and we are achieving this growth while lowering expenses.
Strong client activity and a healthy equity market, coupled with solid expense management, all benefited results.We are asking Merrill Lynch advisors to improve organic growth and we embedded incentives in our 2018 compensation program to drive responsible, organic household growth.
Year-over-year client balances rose to record levels of more than $2.8 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows, and continued loan growth.
Year-over-year revenue growth of 4% was led by a 9% increase in asset management fees and modestly higher NII, partially offset by lower transactional revenue.Turning to Slide 18, Global Banking earned slightly less than $2 billion and generated a 19% return on allocated capital.
Expenses were held flat versus Q3 '17 despite our continued investments in the business, including the addition of sales professionals to enhance local market coverage.Looking at trends on Slide 19 and comparing to Q3 last year, at 2% year over year, growth in average loans moderated this quarter while deposits grew 7%.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think the -- Paul actually can speak to this, too, because he was a leader in that business, but the team did a good job across the last several years of repositioning us after the crisis.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorI had two questions.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe question that you're hearing debated as you see some of the consumer spending numbers come up is they're very strong.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi, Matt.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Managing DirectorI was wondering if you could talk about the outlook for net interest income dollars, just given a little bit of the backup on long rates.
D'Onofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerSay that again, Marty.Marty Mosby -- Vining Sparks -- DirectorOther earning assets sequentially was up 55 basis points, so I was just curious why that was up so much this particular quarter.Paul M.
D'Onofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerOther earnings assets was up 55 basis points...do you think it was the margin?Brian T.
D'Onofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerI don't think there's anything unusual in the consumer loan portfolio that's driving those.
What I think investors are missing is there's a lot of headroom to still trickle up those deposit rates and still continue to improve net interest margin.Brian T.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Managing DirectorYou have worked very diligently with your team since 2010 bringing Bank of America to this level of profitability that you reported today, 123 basis points on assets and an ROE of 11%.
Our commercial loan growth, as you've seen in the market, moderated a bit this quarter, but keep in mind that many companies came into the year flush with cash.
This quarter, we're at $2 billion, up 9% from last year, and we continue to acquire new commercial banking clients, so we're optimistic as we continue to add more customers and deepen existing relationships.With respect to credit risk, here, too, we maintained our strong credit culture, and yes, we grew responsibly.
So far this year, we've hired 2,000 people from those communities, and across every line of business, we are hiring client-facing professionals, more relationship managers, more Merrill Lynch advisors, more Merrill Lynch financial advisors, more U.S. Trust advisors, more small business bankers, more business bankers, more commercial bankers, more middle-market investment bankers, and more corporate bankers, and so on.We're using our resources to invest in the future of the franchise, the people who work here, the tools we use to serve our clients, the capabilities our clients value, and the communities we live in.
Growth was strong, even if you adjust for the lower tax rate from the Tax Act. Year over year, pre-tax income -- as Brian noted -- reached a record $9 billion, up 18%.
The tax rate in Q4 should be marginally higher absent unusual items.Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 6, overall, compared to the end of Q2, deposit growth of $36 billion drove an increase in assets of $47 billion.
On this adjusted basis, NII is up $850 million year over year and the net interest yield is up 13 basis points, driven by broad improvement in asset yields relative to funding costs.With respect to deposit pricing, we continue to see a slow upward movement in rate paid and total interest-bearing deposits.
Mobile and ATM now account for more than three-quarters of deposit transactions, and lastly, mobile, with all its benefits for both our customers and our shareholders, is now approaching half of all digital sales.Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 15, GWIM produced another quarter of strong results, earning net income of more than $1 billion, which was the second-highest quarter ever for this segment.
So, that's how I think about the areas where, this quarter, we underperformed a little bit.To Brian's point, having said all that, I think we know we can do better.
One, just on deposits, I know that you spent quite a bit of time going through on Slide 7 the growth rates there.
We and the industry have not increased deposit rates appreciably in traditional consumer bank accounts.I think the reason for that is because Bank of America delivers a lot of value to depositors.
At some point, rates are going to rise in Consumer as well, and our focus is on balancing our customers' needs with the competitive marketplace and our shareholders' interest, and we'll do the right thing.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorAnd, your branch expansions that you're planning on doing over the next several years -- that hasn't materially kicked in yet.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt's been material relative to the start to finish, and we've crossed a $100 million branch, for example, in Denver within three years, which is very strong, but it's not material to the $1.4 trillion deposit base or the $680 billion in Consumer, so it's not contributing -- it will over time, but right now, it's marginally adding.Betsy, a couple things to think about: The amount of investment we've made in the global transaction services platform across the last eight or nine years have been over $2 billion, so those deposits come from the ability to provide better and better services to clients and that investment rate, and that's the thing.
This takes a lot of investment not only on the consumer side, which is obvious with the mobile and everything that you statistically see, but a lot of people forget on the commercial side, the institutional side, there's this likewise investment going on, so that, we think, is competitively advantaged and our customers respond to it.Paul M.
D'Onofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd, those deposits are up 7% year over year, so we're seeing the growth.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorOkay.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat's going to be...I don't know if I have that off the top of my head, Mike, but if there's 130-140 million households plus all the users, I think we have more than our fair share of it.
D'Onofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerI would think about it -- I mean, as we started Q4 -- and, it's early -- the NII growth we're feeling feels a lot like Q3 in terms of the movement in rate paid so far, and so, I would think about it as a year over year growth being something that feels the same this early in the quarter.
But, again, that increase is going to be dependent on several factors, including loan growth, mix shift -- particularly in Global Markets -- you've got the realization of the forward curve, you've got the competitive bottom with respect to deposit rate paid, and again, I would just think about it banking book versus the market's book.
We're seeing the benefits of our strong deposit base, how we've invested in our clients in a rising rate environment -- we're seeing that if you look at the ""banking book."" Obviously, Global Markets is going to impact that number, but if you look at the banking book, I think you get a better reflection of what's going on at the company.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Managing DirectorAll right, that's all helpful.
I just want to follow up on some of the comments you made on loan growth, and I hear you on high competition, good capital markets, non-bank lenders, corporates flush with cash.
D'Onofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerWhat we would emphasize is given the strength of our platform, given the bankers that we're adding, given our relationships globally, we should be able to grow loans the way we've been talking about, even with these forces, even with the non-banks, even with whatever you're seeing out there.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThere's a lot of discussion there, but at the end of the day, we think we can grow loans in the mid-single digits at 2-3% GDP growth, and you've seen us to that, and we'll continue to do that, and the ebbs and flows of the competition will come or go, and we'll be here driving it.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorLoud and clear.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say, Gerard, you've got to be careful because the mix of the business we have versus what people could have been familiar with at different times in our past is with the markets business and the way that business works in terms of ROA and things, but the reality is the team has done a great job of getting this company back to an earnings level, and we expect to continue to grow that, and we continue to expect to reduce the share count -- 1.4 billion reduction since we started.
Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerRight now, between the dividends and share repurchases -- $6.5 billion this quarter on earnings of $7.2 billion, so it's pushing to 100%.
We continue to perform well in this environment, and we're getting more than our fair share of business, and to do that, we've managed expenses well, drove operating leverage 700 basis points for the quarter.
",27.83,0.92394614
bankofamerica,q4,2018,"Revenue grew a little better than GDP at 3%, and when discussing the growth rate over 2017, we're increasing 2017 baseline as shown to add back the charges taken to the tax act last year.Our client base has expanded, and in our key business, our market leadership positions continued to improve.
And importantly, we believe the same focus on responsible growth and the laser focus on controlling what we can allows us to continue to improve results for 2019.As you can see on Slide 3, every line of business contributed to our growth and earned well above our company's cost of capital, and each line of business had superior efficiency through a focus on operating leverage.
In the fourth quarter alone, we added 70 new clients for our equities team.As you turn to Slide 4, one of the drivers of an expansion in our client base is the fruit of multiple years of continuous improvement in our franchise.
The two programs combined added over $1 billion to all but the top 5% of our team in annual compensation.If you go to the next slide, Slide 6, one of the things that helped us deliver these earnings and growth has been the net increase in net interest income over the last several years.
So, as we look forward into 2019 and consider the debate of whether NII can grow if short-term rate increases stop or slow, we will drive what we control with loan and deposit growth, and even in an unchanged rate environment, that should produce more NII.One of the other areas for improvement has been a continuingly increasing amount of capital we've been able to return to you, our shareholders.
It has more earnings, more capital, but 14% less shares than the peak, and we see much more head.So, we strive to deliver what we control: More customers, more activities from those customers, whether it's loans, whether it's deposits, whether it's assets under management, whether it's underwriting fees, whether it's trading revenue, we continue to drive what we control, and we control the risk and expenses, and we do this while driving our competitive advantage through increasing investments in people, technology, and physical platform.
It sounds like another year of driving responsible growth.Now, before I ask Paul to dive in the quarter, I wanted to give you -- we all are facing a perceived change in the operating environment, with predictions in the year ahead reflecting a range of outcomes from GDP growth in the mid-2s, to lower growth, to recession.
Year-over-year return on assets and equity improved significantly.Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10, overall, compared to the end of Q3, the balance sheet grew $16 billion, driven by commercial loan growth.
RWA decline was driven by lower global markets' RWA and the sale of non-core consumer loans, which offset the impact of loan growth across the businesses.Looking at deposits on Slide 11, overall, average deposits grew 4% year over year.
Also, as mentioned earlier, in global banking, we saw expected rotation from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits.Turning to Slide 12, total loans on an average basis were $934 billion.
As you look forward to 2019, keep in mind Q1 has two less days of interest accrual, which will negatively impact NII by about $200 million.Turning to expenses on Slide 14, we finished the year with another solid quarter of expense management.
The only thing I would note here is with respect to consumer, seasoning drove credit card losses modestly higher, but the loss ratio remained below 3%.Okay, turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 17, Q4 finished a strong year, generating $12 billion in full-year earnings.
And, customer activity in the quarter remained solid across all major product categories.Turning to Slide 18, you can see that 10% revenue growth was driven by NII, as we realized the value of our deposits through our focus on relationship deepening.
Mobile and ATM now account for more than three quarters of deposit transactions, and mobile, with all its benefits for our customers and our shareholders, is now approaching half of all digital sales.Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 20, GWIM produced another quarter of strong results, delivering client flows totaling $35 billion, one of the best quarters of client flows in the company's history, which is partially due to growth in net new households.
The business created more than 400 basis points of operating leverage, growing revenue 7% while holding expense growth to 2%.Revenue included solid growth in NII and non-interest income, overcoming some of the negative impacts of a decline in the financial markets early in the quarter.
On the banking side, we had deposit flows of $21 billion, as some investors increased their allocation of cash, and ending loan balances grew $3 billion.Turning to Slide 22, Global Banking earned $2.1 billion and generated a 20% return on allocated capital.
Revenue of $5.1 billion and pre-tax earnings of $2.8 billion were both up modestly year over year, but this growth is understated given the impact of the tax act on tax-advantaged investments in Q4 '18 versus Q4 '17.Revenue was led by 4% growth in NII from strong deposit growth and higher rates, but was offset by the small decline in investment banking fees.
And, while the market may now believe interest rate hikes have stopped, we believe we can grow net interest income without rate hikes, assuming modest levels of loan and deposit growth.With regard to things that are more in our control, because of all the hard work our employees are doing to eliminate duplicative work and root out inefficiencies, we expect expense in 2019 to be roughly the same as 2018, and as Brian said, we also don't expect any meaningful change in net charge-offs in 2019 based on our years of responsible growth and our view of the credit horizon.So, we enter 2019 positively, with a strong balance sheet and market share in businesses that positions us well for better earnings again in 2019.
Brian, I know you always say it's because you have good team members and everything else, but how much of that growth is due to mobile banking and digital banking, and of that component, how much would be due to millennials?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo, Mike, to put in perspective, I think we had $20-odd billion of fourth quarter '17 to fourth quarter '18 checking account growth in Consumer.
There are not enough millennials to meet those statistics, so this is a broad-based change going on, and whether it's people 80 years old, 70 years old, 60 years old, the way people use the capabilities that we have built for them is across the board.So, any technology adoption -- people often attribute it to millennials, but when you think about that kind of penetration of digital practice and 1.5 billion logins a quarter, 77% of the checks deposited not at the branch -- i.e., through ATMs and mobile deposit -- you just don't have enough millennials to go around.
I've asked this before, but what is your market share of digital banking users -- or, at least, how much of that checking account growth over the last year is due to digital banking?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt's always hard to -- our market share in consumer deposits, we think, is around 13-15% depending on what you calculate, Mike, and it's growing.
If the economy shrinks or something, that's a different question.We sort of think that this model -- all the things you cited in the opening to your question -- is the model, which is grow in a faster economy, keep the expenses flat, keep the credit risk in check, and drive that operating leverage and bring the share count down.
There was a fundamental resetting, obviously, through not only the operating performance, but the tax reform, but now, they'll grind forward a little bit, but they'll be in that range -- 14-16% return on tangible common equity -- and maybe move up higher than that on a given quarter, but I think we're in a solid place right now.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorI appreciate it.
Has anything changed from the past?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think the simple way to put it -- it's all of two weeks into the quarter or whatever -- is that we've seen the normal progression that you see from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, and it's solid out there right now, and the equities business is stronger, as we referenced earlier.
We could always choose not to invest, but I think if you looked at what we're investing in, you'd say, ""Keep going."" Honestly, as a shareholder, it'd be the better answer for the company because the technology investments allow us to take long-term expenses down and things like that.So, there's always leverage you can pull, but that's -- the business model we've been operating for many years now has been to constantly be pulling those levers with time.
So, those are always moving down into our benefit as we move through it, and so, I think if you look at that operating leverage, yeah, if revenues were flat because of whatever's going on out there, we should be able to manage expenses underneath it.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Managing DirectorAnd then, could you speak a little bit to the investment spend that you're making in the investment bank, and in particular, in which geographies you're really looking to increase your market share?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think the U.S. being the biggest...fee pool by far, as people talk about it -- we continue to do that.
Have you taken down the amount you're willing to put on the balance sheet, at least in the short term, or how do we think about how you manage today versus what you did a year ago?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAs I said earlier in response to another question, we're in the moving business, not the storage business as risk goes.
We expect to continue to drive incremental improvement in these businesses as we take advantage of our very strong franchise and continued investments in digitalization and operating efficiency, as well as our relationship management capacity and core products and services.Let me give you a few examples.
This continues to strongly help NII growth.So, you can see these on the right-hand side: Average deposits grew more than $150 billion after the past four years at a 4% compound annual growth rate.
Given our robust funding levels, we expect our parent debt issuances in 2019 will likely be less than maturities.Total shareholder equity increased $3 billion from Q3, as AOCI benefited from increases in the value of our AFS debt securities given the decline in loan and rates.
We returned 95% of net income available to common -- or $6.7 billion -- through the combination of dividends and share repurchases in the quarter.Turning to regulatory metrics, our CET1 standardized ratio improved 22 basis points to 11.6% from Q3 and remains well above our 9.5% requirement.
Strong improvement in our core banking activities was partially offset by the impact of lower-yielding global markets assets.Including our global markets segment, which primarily reflects our trading-related assets, NII from core banking activities grew almost $1 billion year over year, or 9%.
Average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits of 67 basis points rose 12 basis points from Q3 and is up 56 basis points versus Q4 '15, which was the beginning of this Fed rate hike cycle.Turning to asset sensitivity, as of 12/31, an instantaneous 100-basis-point parallel increase in rates above the forward curve is estimated to increase NII by $2.7 billion over the subsequent 12 months.
This expense level includes approximately $1 billion for increased spending in the aggregate in several areas: Normal yearly merit, healthcare benefits, primary from inflation, marketing, and the previously announced new investment initiative spending in technology as well as expansion and modernization of financial centers.On a full-year basis, we believe we should be able to offset these investments through lower FDIC insurance and other efficiencies.
We expect expenses should trend lower than Q1 through the remaining quarters of 2019.Turning to asset quality on Slide 15, asset quality continued to perform very well.
You will also note non-interest income improved year over year from account growth and higher levels of consumer spending.
It's important to note as you look at 2019 that the December drop in equity markets doesn't actually impact AUM fees until Q1 '19 due to the one-month lag in the determination of fees for assets under management.Moving to Slide 21, trends reflected strong client engagement in Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trusts.
Strong household growth and continued near-record-low attrition of experienced financial advisors contributed to the $35 billion in overall client flows this quarter.
Efficiency savings and lower deposit insurance costs more than offset continued investment in the business.Looking at trends on Slide 23 and comparing to Q4 last year, since we already covered loan and deposits, I'll start with IB fees.
Market volatility led to increased client activity, producing revenue and improvements in both derivatives and in client financing activities, where have been recently investing.On Slide 25, I would just point out the chart on the bottom left, which shows at roughly $13 billion in full-year revenues the relative stability of trading and sales over the past three years.
It'll ebb and flow a little bit by market values because of the way it works, but it's really because the equities business -- the investments we made in technologies and capabilities have now turned out into providing balance sheet capacity and capability of the prime brokerage business.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- Managing DirectorPerfect.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerWe're not disclosing what our TLAC ratio is, but I will say that as we sit here today, we have a comfortable cushion, and as you also heard in my prepared remarks, the debt issuances this year are likely going to be less than maturities.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Executive DirectorOkay, looking forward to more updates in the future.
Brian, you made an interesting remark at a conference recently in December, noting that you expect through the cycle loss expectations to come in well below 90 basis points, but at the same time, didn't really commit to an explicit level or expectation, and given the late-cycle rhetoric, the focus on -- particularly from long-onlys with longer horizons as to what through-the-cycle loss expectations might be and all the balance sheet cleansing you've accomplished, I was wondering if you could maybe provide us with some sort of benchmark or target expectation that we can compare you guys against versus peers, just given many have provided at least medium-term or through-the-cycle loss expectations already.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerEarlier, I said what I expected for '19 -- charge-offs in the range of where they are now.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerFirst thing to think about as we look at that securities book -- we're always balancing earnings against capital and liquidity.
Longer-term, NIM is really going to depend on the forward curve and our ability to lag deposit rate paid.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Managing DirectorOkay.
Please go ahead.Saul Martinez -- UBS Investment Bank -- Managing DirectorHi, good morning, everybody.
",16.77,0.6402067
bankofamerica,q1,2019,"Provision expense is up year-over-year to match those net charge-offs more closely and we had a small reserve build this quarter against the net reserve release last year.Through disciplined capital deployment, after meeting all the requirements to make loans to our customers and support their businesses, we continue to drive our share count lower.
We are well under way with our goal to wring out the dilution in shares caused by the increased capital build after the crisis.Through share buybacks, our diluted shares are down 7% compared to the first quarter of 2018 and down 1.5 billion shares in the past four years.Turning to Slide 3.
We're getting more business as we add relationship management capacity, increase our marketing and drive deeper penetration of U.S. markets through the full franchise entry and more and more markets across the United States.We also continue to invest in our people with industry leading benefit plans, both in health and retirement, with industry-leading capabilities and universities to train and reskill our teammates and plus the pay plan we announced recently, we are going to increase our minimum wage over the next 26 months from $15 an hour plus to $20 an hour.
And as we have discussed many times, our initial spending for technology has been running around $3 billion for many years now, but is currently, the savings (ph) from tax reform expected to be 10% higher in 2019.We continue to enhance both our physical network for delivering products and services to clients, as well as the facilities we operate in communities and countries around the globe.
Customers value the capabilities and rewards of their relationship and continue to see lower attrition and 90% plus primary bank status.
Particularly promising was a strong rebound in our middle market customer base, where we saw growth and line usage increase.
Long-term debt increased $4 billion, common shareholders' equity increased $1.7 billion from Q4, as the value of our AFS debt securities benefited from the decline in long-end interest rates, thereby increasing AOCI.Partially offsetting the increase was the return of more capital than we earned this quarter.
Net interest yield of 2.51% improved 9 basis points year-over-year, but was down 1 basis point linked quarter.Deposit rates in our Wealth Management and Global Banking businesses increased, however, we saw minimal movement in our consumer business.
We also typically see less benefit from loan growth, driven by paydowns on year-end credit card balances in Q2.Finally, long-end rates have fallen across Q1 and remain lower.
This perspective assumes today's forward curve and loan and deposit growth, consistent with the current economic environment.Turning to expenses on Slide 12.
With the expected expense levels for full year 2019 and 2020, as you know, we increased for 2019 our planned level of initiative spending, supporting both physical and digital expansion and we've made announcements of further investments in our people, like our minimum wage increase.
However, please note that the quarterly progression of expenses in 2019 may look a little different than the past years, as it will be impacted by the timing of planned technology and marketing spend.Turning to asset quality on Slide 13.
In Q1, there was also one charge-off related to a single utility client, which increased losses by $84 million, impacting comparisons against both periods.The net charge-off ratio was 43 basis points.
Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to approximate this quarter's $1 billion level for each of the remaining quarters in 2019, assuming current economic conditions continue.On Slide 14, we break out credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios.
Investment assets in the consumer segment ended the quarter up $29 billion from Q1 '18 on solid flows and a Q1 '19 market rebound.
Within revenue, positive impacts from the banking activities and AUM flows were not enough to overcome lower market valuations, declines in transactional revenue and general pricing pressures.
We also saw growth in custom lending.Okay, before discussing Global Banking and Global Markets separately, I know many of you look at these segments together.
These increases more than compensated for a decline in investment banking and loan spread compression.The business created more than 400 basis points of operating leverage, as revenue growth was matched with a 1% decline in expenses.
Lastly, provision expense increased year-over-year, driven by the single-name charge-off mentioned earlier, as well as the absence of the prior year's energy reserve release.Looking at trends on Slide 20 and comparing to Q1 last year, let's focus on IB fees.
Much lower market volatility this year resulted in less client activity and weaker performance in equity derivatives.
The year-over-year expense decline was a reflection of lower revenue-related costs.On Slide 22 you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remained weighted to domestic activity, where fee pools are concentrated.
Within FICCs, we remain more oriented toward credit products than macro.All right, finally on Slide 23, we show All Other, which reported a net loss of $48 million, which was relatively unchanged from the prior year period.
This moved the tax rate in the quarter from our expected full year rate of 19% to the reported 17% rate in Q1.Okay, with that let's open it up to questions.Questions and Answers:Operator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
The third bucket of revenue, which are more market related would be the sales and trading revenue, the investment banking fees and asset management brokerage revenue, which are both dependent on market levels at a given moment and market activity, giving rise to those levels.So, if you think about this quarter versus last year, our market related types of revenue was down 12%.
All in, Bank of America invests around $2 billion a year in capital expenditures to build out, enhance our buildings, facilities and infrastructure.As it relates to our financial centers, our ATMs and other physical build-out, the point is we haven't just announced what we'll do, we're halfway through the broad-based build-out in our consumer business.
The ratio was flat, because the increase in AOCI, mentioned earlier, was offset by higher RWA, primarily in Global Markets.Turning to Slide 11, I want to spend a few moments on NII, given the changes in the rate environment.
The improvement was driven by the value of our deposits, as interest rates rose, as well as loan and deposit growth, partially offset by lower loan spreads.On a linked quarter basis, GAAP NII was down $128 million.
Q1 reflects continued strong momentum from 2018, as deposits grew $23 billion, or 3%, revenue grew 7% and expenses were down 4%, creating operating leverage of 11%.
The business created 360 basis points of year-over-year operating leverage, as expense declined 4%, while revenue was down only modestly.
Strong household growth in both businesses and continued low attrition of experienced financial advisors contributed to the $17 billion in overall client flows.On the banking side, deposits were up $20 billion year-over-year, which included inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds to deposits near the end of 2018.
It sounds like you expect NII to be down sequentially in the second quarter on a few of those pressure points that you mentioned, and then to grow some in the back half, as loan and deposit growth and day count get more favorable.Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, look, we -- we're not a hedge fund, we're a bank and so we are customer-driven, and our asset sensitivity is driven by our loans and our deposits and the activity that our customers do with us.
I'm just looking for some color on how real-time is that, in other words, if we get no hikes for this quarter, next quarter, do you think you see an almost immediate stop in that shift?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think -- Glenn, what I was saying was that the -- you got to look at what drives the value of the consumer deposit franchise in the Company and that's the consumer side.
We have 0.5 million more checking accounts than we did a year ago, to give you a sense, in a book of 34.5 million, went to 35 million.On the non-interest bearing side, the reference was in the commercial side, which, because the way cash management services are priced, when the rates rise, you people have to hold less balances to get the fees, hence (ph) credit rate goes up.
Is that a customer behavior thing, or has Bank of America changed anything on how it charges fees?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe continue to think about and continue to change our policies on overdrafts, which has a downward effect on it.
Just given the current outlook for loan and deposit growth and expectations for expenses to increase year-on-year at least for the remainder of '19, are you still confident, given the NII guidance and your ability, to continue that momentum and deliver positive operating leverage even in the absence of higher rates?Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I mean, look, the way I would think about it is, we've given you guidance on expenses, we've told you that in '19 and '20, we expect that our expenses will be approximately what they were for full year 2018 on an adjusted basis.
Can you give us some color on where you think the efficiency ratio could eventually get to, and you can operate consistently at that level?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell Gerard, I think it's just -- as we said, it continues to drift down.
So, I don't -- if I say to you guys on this call, or my team will say, oh, we made a goal, so the goals to continue to drive it.Gerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystVery good, thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
And then can you speak a little bit to the loan growth side, because we got the NII overall and understand the NIM trajectory here, but can you just give us a sense as to what's in your outlook there for loan growth and if there's any variance between the different buckets that would be helpful to?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think, Betsy just to give you -- for our Company and for the U.S. economy, especially, where we saw some strong -- strong, relatively strong performance was in our middle market business this quarter, in our small business.
So, expect us to see the core loan growth in that mid-single digits and expect maybe a little bit more, but come through the bottom line as the non-core runs off.Betsy, just to follow up on your question to Paul on expenses.
And I'm wondering do you feel that you are fully baked there with your headcount, or is there still some more room to ramp that, and thinking about what the impact is going to be on the loan growth, as you indicated earlier?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo, if you look at it, think about this time last year and into the summer, we continue to look at our position, we've been adding people.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerJust to give you a sense on progress, if you look at hiring year-to-date versus last year in investment banking and capital markets, commercial bankers, it's at three-times the pace as it was last year.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, from a capital perspective, it's going to get phased in over three years.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystYeah, understood.OperatorAnd our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Essentially, are there revenue opportunities that you can control, independent of the macro, if the expenses are kind of lined up and flat and there is not too much more to do there?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think if you think about a growth rate and economy of 2 percentage points or so and you think back about the last decade, we've been at that level more than we've been at any other level.
So, we feel good just grinding out more customer relationships and more loans and deposits and more wealth management business from them and that will give us a pre-tax -- ability to grow pre-tax in the mid- to upper single digits and then the share count through the capital management.So, that's the model of the 2% growth economy.
And how will you know if we are entering a ""new credit cycle""?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell, we continue to -- those are great questions, Nancy, when you think about it in a broader context.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerI'll just point out, I know, you're asking how will we know, but the one thing I do want to stress is, how much we've transformed the Company over the last 10 years by sticking to responsible growth, by changing the mix between consumer and commercial, by focusing on prime and super-prime.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, look, we're -- look I would expect low single-digit year-over-year growth to sort of continue.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerLook, I just think it's good economy and we have high-quality customers in our card portfolio and they're taking some of their excess deposits and paying off their balances.Vivek Juneja -- JPMorgan -- AnalystOkay.
But can you point anything specifically, I think (ph) you're actually seeing an improvement on the commercial side, like line utilization up year-on-year, are you seeing more CapEx spending?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, there has been a lot of talk, if you think about the last couple of years, of the economy -- the last year and a half on economy, and commercial loan growth.
That was down like over $1 billion and that's now flattened out in terms of core linked quarter impact.Second thing is as the small business continues to grow, it does a good job in that and you can see that separately.
As the market settled in and we liked the credit risk better, we've actually seen a little better growth in the commercial real estate segment, very high and very capable, very strong quality, that's helped us a little bit too.And then the last thing, which I think is good news, the economy overall, is the line usage went up about a point in middle market, which is -- which means that -- that's across a lot of lines, obviously.
Was the seasonality impacts greater than the rewards impact in that linked quarter decline in card income and consumer banking?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe impact of -- if charges were up and fees were down, obviously, the impact of the rewards, credits and other credits, both to the merchant and everything else exceeded the growth in the revenue.

bankofamerica,q2,2019,"However, what we saw on our client base during the second quarter 2019 was solid consumer activity, pointing to a continued growing economy in the United States this year, albeit at a slower pace.
In that environment, our company reported the best earnings quarter in the company's history, that is made possible through the hard work of my 209,000 teammates who are driving responsible growth.We reported $7.3 billion in after-tax net income and $0.74 per share.
In those 18 quarters, you've seen many different market environments, changes in interest rates, economic growth that's sped up or slowed down, but we still managed to drive operating leverage for 4.5 years and successively.
If you look at our digital-only clients, meaning customers have not used a financial center in the past year, we have 30 million consumer customers across our platform who have -- are primary digital who have more than $400 billion in balances with us today.
To better serve the 0.75 million customers that come into our centers every day, this quarter, we added another 17 financial centers to help drive the growth in our consumer business.
Improved the CET1 ratio, while higher loan balances and commitments mitigated some of that improvement.Moving to client activity and starting with average deposits on Slide 9, average deposits grew nearly $75 billion or 6% year-over-year.
Deposits with consumers grew $37 billion or 4% within that global wealth management was up $18 billion year-over-year, reflecting client growth with a preference to hold cash of mid-market uncertainty as well as inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds to deposits near the end of 2018.
Growth of loans to consumers was led by an increase in mortgages as lower interest rates stimulated more originations and allow many of our customers to lower the cost of owning their existing home or buying a new one.
In Q2, we benefited from additional day of interest as well as loan and deposit growth, which was more than offset by three factors.First, lower long term rates resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage-backed securities, which caused higher write-offs of bond premiums.
With LIBOR rates lower than Q1 and the forward curve predicting further declines, we would expect client deposit rates to begin to move lower over the third quarter.Turning to asset sensitivity of our banking book.
If rates follow the forward curve and the fed funds rate were indeed to be cut twice this year starting this month, we think it would likely shave another 1% of NII growth for 2019.Turning to expenses on Slide 12.
We expect increased technology investment in the second half, plus the cost of adding new client-facing professionals to be roughly offset by the seasonally lower incentive costs.
Absent this recovery net charge-offs were just over $1 billion or 43 basis points of average loans and consistent with the net loss of rate ratio in Q1 and the prior year quarter.Outside of the normal expected Q2 seasonality in our credit card portfolio, we had a modest increase in commercial driven by a couple of single name losses.
And in commercial, we also saw a modest decline in non-performing loans, while reservable criticized ratios remained near historic lows.Turning to the business segments, and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 15.
Consumer Banking produced another strong quarter, earnings grew 13% year-over-year to $3.3 billion.
Customer satisfaction improved, asset quality remained strong as a net charge-off ratio was 124 basis points decreasing 4 basis points year-over-year.And I would note that much of the loan growth that we have added to our balance sheet is high quality consumer real estate loans.
However, as with card versus Q1, we saw a modest improvement in service charges.Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 17, strong results were driven by new investment accounts and more traditional banking products as well as the markets rebound in the quarter.
The business created 240 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year, as revenue increased more than 3% and expenses grew 1%.
Within revenue, positive impacts from banking activities and higher rates, growth NII higher, while fee improvements from AUM flows and market valuations more than offset general pricing pressures, with respect to expenses higher revenue related incentives as well as continued investment in new advisors, technology and brand were modestly offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs.
For example, GWIM clients used e-signature twice as much as they did only a year ago.Moving to Slide 18, GWIM results reflect continued solid client engagement in both Merrill and the private bank, strong household growth in both businesses, contributed to the $2.9 trillion in client balances.
On the banking side, deposits of $254 billion were up $18 billion or 7% year-over-year driven by client growth and the desire by some clients to hold more cash amid the market uncertainty.Linked quarter deposit outflows reflected seasonal tax payments by our customers.
Revenue was down modestly year-over-year as loan spread compression and ALM activities offset the benefit of loan and deposit growth.Strong deposit and loan growth reflects the hundreds of bankers we have added as well as continued investment in how we deliver our loan product and treasury service.
With respect to expenses, lower deposit insurance costs, mostly offset continued investment in technology and bankers.Looking at trends on Slide 20 and comparing to Q2 last year.
The decline in equities to $1.1 billion reflects weaker performance in EMEA derivatives compared to a stronger year ago period.Fixed lower revenue was due to a weaker trading environment with lower overall client activity across most products.
The 2% year-over-year expense decline was a reflection of lower revenue related compensation.On Slide 22, you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remains heavily weighted to domestic activity, where a global fee pools are centered.
Remember that if you think about the industry's thought process over the last three years basically as rates rose, that was one thought process in how people price deposits and other things.
And how you know that it's going to continue to fuel that growth, maybe something a little bit more of growth coming from current customer base versus new ones, things like that?
Thanks.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo just starting at end of your question and working backwards, we generated another 1 million plus cards this quarter.
That seems like a big number for such an already big business and the related question is, do you think of there being a ceiling to margins because they're already huge at 29%?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerA couple things.
They got their teams sort of moving along and as you said, growing at a consistent 5%, 6%, 7% depending on the product set, the type of -- whether real estate is lower versus core middle market, and so we feel very good about that.
Brian, I know you touched on this a little bit, but could you talk about your feelings or your ability to maintain the strong checking account growth that you had given the stance on rates paid?
But the one piece you're missing is that in addition to being modestly liability sensitive in the trading book, when you look at those disclosures about the impact of 100 basis point shock on the downgrade scenario on the short end, remember, that's below the forward curve.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- Analystright.Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerSo you're looking -- you're literally talking about a scenario where short-end rates would be shot down to 75 basis points and long end would be at 1 percentage point.
But when you put all the factors together, you kind of get to roughly 100 basis points -- I mean $100 million on that first rate cut.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystOkay.Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerAnd remember, when I went through the script and talked about how that we still end up growing year-over-year, 2019 versus 2018, you've got to factor in loan and deposit growth.
So maybe if you can speak to some of the factors that are driving more benign impact in terms of the rate sensitivity that you cited versus was explicitly disclosed in the 10-Q, whether it's volume growth, some issues relating to your comparing it versus the forward curve, deposit offsets or anything else you can speak to?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerJust one thing to be precise.
Thank you.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI'll let Paul hit that one just because he talked about it.
So I think Paul said, we'll talk about that next quarter when we know a little bit more.Vivek Juneja -- JP Morgan Chase & Co.
It depends on the rate environment.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerRemember, it really is a question of looking at the different businesses because consumers had checking grow 41 consecutive quarters.
For further information on any forward-looking statements, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or our SEC filings.With that, I'll turn it over to you, Brian.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Lee, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results.
And in the end, responsive growth continued to prove strong earnings, returns and shareholder value.As we look at Slide 3, we start to highlight how we achieved these results.
At the same time, we saw strong investment flows from those customers.Loans in our businesses grew $34 billion or 4%.
As a nice start, we saw market shares across many of the products in investment banking in the first half of this year.
But also, most importantly, the drive we've had toward being the core relationship bank from an American consumer.Now in the recent past, from offsetting those rate of fee reduction by increasing the growth in the actual counts, the number of accounts we have that our primary household relationships in the past last few years.
And at the end of the day, when you look at the total relationships in those consumers, it's great economics for our shareholders.Now next couple of slides, we're going to do something we've done in each of the earnings reports for some time, but we're going to add a piece to it.
This is why we continue to invest heavily in enhancing our number one ranked digital platform while, at the same time, enhancing our best-in-class financial centers.And again, this quarter, you see the interaction of those two in the lower left-hand side of this slide where the record number of appointments that were set up.
Overall, compared to the end of Q1, the balance sheet grew $19 billion driven by loan growth, which ended the quarter more than $20 billion higher in our business segments.
Consumer Banking deposits grew by $19 billion or 3% year-over-year.
As a result of these impacts, net interest yield of 2.44%, declined 7 basis points linked quarter, but was up 3 basis points year-over-year.With respect to deposit rates.
The lower current forward curve also caused increased asset sensitivity in the falling rate scenario.In the second half of the year, we expect NII to benefit from growth in loans and deposits, as well as an additional day of interest in Q3.
Even as we invest in new markets and renovate financial centers, the all-in 162 basis point cost of running the deposit franchise was relatively flat compared to Q2 '18, as the decline in the cost of deposits component offset the increase in rates paid.
Looking at them on a separate basis and beginning with Global Banking on Slide 19, the business earned $1.9 billion and generated a 19% return on allocated capital in the quarter.
Please go ahead.James Mitchell -- The Buckingham Research Group -- AnalystHey, good morning, guys.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerMorning,James Mitchell -- The Buckingham Research Group -- AnalystHey, just might as well ask the question on NII.
The quarterly impact of that is a little more than $175 million, but it'll be even less than that because that $3 billion is measured relative to the forward curve, which already includes rate cuts.
And I think if you look at some of the statistics and materials on the -- especially on the corporate GTS type business that the necessary increase for the highest balance customers and et cetera, that's occurred, will slow down and come back the other way.
But if you look at the more recent quarterly trend, you're going to see that you've seen the impact decline, although it's still going to hit, but you're seeing that help fuel our deposit growth in checking deposits, especially at 6% year-over-year in consumer.
And this year, we'll do 7 million referrals across all the businesses in the markets that we're doing.And so -- and then on the margin, if we move to 29%, as you see that NII type activity as loans and deposits continue to grow, that margin will continue to grow.
And if so, how do you change the price of products for that millennial customer set?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerOne of the things and I don't want to sound perspicacious in terms of people's views of big banks don't do big business with millennials, it's just to set the tone.
The answer is they have in the past, and we expect in the future as long as we keep driving the great experiences we have and going back to the comments on Page 6 to 8 of the slide deck on consumer strategies just look at the activity levels, and those are generally would have a stronger cohort to younger below 40-year old people.
The assumption is that once you get new customers, maybe they will stay with you longer than they would've, say, 10 years ago.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell, that goes back to your colleague's question about the rewards and things like that.
I mean we don't see anything on the horizon to suggest that we can't continue to grow kind of what we've been telling you, which is kind of the low to mid-single digits for the company from the business segments.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI'd just add two thoughts, though.
What's your outlook for that checking account growth to continue or maybe relative to GDP or to the industry?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerIf you look at it, we have maintained that pace.
If you look in the money markets and stuff and see the rates, that's where the people get paid for the excess balances, but this is the money that's flowing through the household on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, and we feel very good about it and figure we can continue it because we have in all the environments and all the rate changes.John McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- AnalystGreat.
So you've got to factor in both of those things.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystNo, understood there, but is the logic right, I guess, is my question that you'll get an offset and that offset is sort of in that magnitude of, for every 25 basis point something in the neighborhood of $75 million on the trading book?Paul M.
So all those things impact it.Saul Martinez -- UBS -- AnalystAnd you're also baking in a little bit of a benefit, a little bit of an offset then from expanding margins and trading book on the rate cuts in that guidance?Paul M.
I think this is a result of all the things that we said we were going to do, not that we ever had a problem in Investment Banking.
It's only an impact when the rates go down, you get a live effect on some increase in write-off of premium, and so that's what's going on.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerPaul, just on that this quarter, a couple of basis points of the compression due to the amortization of the premium, which goes away next quarter if rates -- if the tenure doesn't fall by 50 basis points again during the quarter, so -- and another basis point sort of seasonality.
Thanks.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo I think if you think about it over the last two years plus, I think we've ran around $13.1 billion, $13.2 billion, $13.3 billion in quarterly expenses.
But right now, we think '19 is going to come in a couple of hundred million under what we said, which just goes -- by the teammates here is good management.
We just kept driving the basic efficiency of this platform through and we'll continue to do that.And if that comes in to be lower than the number we're talking about for '20 and we get there, it's going to go to you.
And should we assume the timing if you do apparently you use all that is spread even or do you have the flexibility to front end if you wanted to?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYes, we plan to use all of it and it's spread equally over the quarters under the way the method works and the sort of the guidance they gave you.
Brian, you mentioned in your opening remarks just how strong credit is and expected to continue and you guys have talked about charge-offs kind of living in the $900 million to $1 billion range a quarter.
And if we see the -- if we think the environment stays the way it is, that's what we think it's going to be and then provision will follow that.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd when you think about it, cards the number, right?
We all see the employment numbers, which are very strong, but what are you guys seeing both in small business and midsized and larger businesses?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo the core loan growth is strong.
So if you look at the pass-through rate and the down scenario an average we're talking approximately 40%, and again, consumer would be a lot lower, GWIM and Global Banking would be a lot higher kind of in 60%, 65% range.Brian Kleinhanzl -- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And if you think about that, if you add that in the cost of deposit rate paid, you're basically flat year-over-year in total cost of goods sold, for lack of a better term, to produce this wonderful transaction franchise and consumer.
When we were talking about earlier in this call somebody asked about what was the next 25 basis points, and we went through what we thought the impact of that was.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerRight, and I think Paul's statements early in the prepared remarks are exactly what you're saying, which is stable rates and follow the forward curve with the rest of '19.
So what you should focus on is the fact that we grew deposits in Global Banking 12% year-over-year, that reflects the sophistication and value we're bringing clients from that treasury services platform, and it reflects the bankers we've added and the relationships that they have in the US and around the world, 12% growth in a kind of is going at 2% feels good to us.
We're not paying attention to a few basis points here or there.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWe look at the long term, Mike, as you're well aware.

bankofamerica,q3,2019,"We'll then open up for questions, please try to limit your questions so that we can get to all the callers and for more information on the forward-looking comments we may make, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or the SEC filings.With that, take it away, Brian.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Lee. That's what we've been telling you, which has been what we call responsible growth.The investments we are making in the franchise for many years and our disciplined responsible growth approach or even across every line of business results in respective customer basis you'll see in the materials.
So, before Paul dives into the quarter's results, through the lines of business, I wanted to cover a little bit about client activity, costs and operating leverage at an enterprise level.
This means, the US consumer continues to benefit by strong employment prospects.Now, interesting on the commercial side clients, at roughly $325 billion in average US commercial loans outstanding, we do see a lot of client flows as the market leader in United States.
We have been investing in the client facing team mates in our commercial banking for a few years and we've increased our investment banking covers, especially in the middle market and we've added new traders and sales staff in Europe as we opened our Paris brokerage office.As you can see, these efforts and deepen relationships with 3% growth in solutions for household, customer relationship and commercial.
Since the end of 2015, our average consumer banking deposits are up $145 billion in balances, three quarters that coming from checking accounts.
Our rate paid remains low due to that superior mix of deposits.Now, when you look at global banking in the lower right-hand side of the slide, $23 billion in deposit growth reflects a rising rate environment and the additional bankers we have deployed over the last few years to continue to sell our superior global transaction services, capabilities.
And even as we continue to invest, the cost of deposit year-over-year declined to 150 basis points nearly offsetting the increase in rate paid, which is now 11 basis points.Deposit growth was up $22 billion or 3% and centered in low rate checking.
One of the reasons for growth in deposits and Global Banking has been our consistent investment over multiple years and digital capabilities within our transaction services platform.Referring to slide 19, note the growth in mobile and digital usage at the top of the page, and our focus on solutions for clients on the bottom of the page.
I know there's a lot of moving parts, but given the forward curve and maybe you could also help us think about the premium amortization, year-to-date, what that drag has been and how that would play out in a stable rate environment from here.
I think, we have -- if you go back many quarters ago we discussed, our thought process is to tell our team mates to price to achieve sustainable deposit growth of 3% or more faster in the economy, which means you are in -- point there as you're gaining share at all times if economy is growing less.
So what's your confidence in growing revenues faster than expenses over the next year, even though you're not giving specific guidance, but more generally, what's the role technology inside the firm that's enabling this operating leverage.For example, how many data centers do you have and how many you are going to close, of what percent of your applications, you expect to migrate to the cloud, just a little bit more color on what's happening behind the scenes that enables your operating leverage and your expectation for continuing that.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerNo. And Mike those a good questions.
But the real key is back to your -- sort of your second question, which is we are -- we are getting the benefits of sustained long-term investment in the change, the way this company operates that continue to push through.
One on loan growth, I think, growing loans, core loan, 6% and a 2% world like you described would be considered great by most metrics, just curious if you think that's sustainable, if we're going to sustain 2% world.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah.
So I think it's sustainable and mid-single digits, maybe six a little higher, maybe five, maybe four, maybe six, if economies are two, but this taking market share, because of the deployment of the capabilities into the -- into the middle market and business banking franchise is along with some of the work that's going on with investment banking and others is a good place to be.
And remember that disclosure is beyond the forward curve, which has three rate cuts in it right, but if you look at that disclosure you will see that full 100 basis points would equate to around $3.3 billion on the short end, you just divide by 16, and you're going to get the impact on quarterly basis of about $200 million.
It's going to be -- it's going to be less than $200 million and I'd even tell you it's going to be meaningfully less than $200 million.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerJohn, these things -- I know, you guys would like us to round it out to six digit each time and give it to you [Indecipherable] years, but the reality is, we gave you an estimate for this quarter, last quarter, I mean, fourth quarter -- the current quarter and we gave it to you last quarter.
I realize it's a small piece of the revenue line you've got, but just want to see if you think that this is at all, something that you need to address in the marketplace?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThe -- so, Betsy, let me take that.
Is that a fair way to read it?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThat's really not relevant here, because that's in the wealth management business, where this stuff shows up is actually back in the consumer side, because Merrill Edge is in that area and that's where the lion's share is.
And as you will know and so that's a constant change of fighting the average yield for the total client assets in that business, but that's not affected by this decision.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGot it.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd you -- you will see us push a little bit on some of the qualification for to open up this capability and another set of clients, but we only have 13% less to go, so.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGot it.
You're largely around all the CCAR stuff, but ultimately in some of the work we are doing, but really to get all the data rates actually the parts and things that can operate are operating on good data and that investment then allows us to take advantage of it and we're still in the early days, quotes that we invested in the markets business, so it's from one side of the company, the other.And going to the earlier comment, what target do you have?
Can you get into a little bit more detail, if there is still more that can be done on expenses in there, I mean -- the positive operating leverage with expenses down.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah.
Correct.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I think it's just -- the third quarter was just a little bit of timing.
Just ebbing and flowing on marketing and other areas, which will rebound investments we expect some of that to rebound in the fourth quarter.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd Matt, that's why, if you go back to that earlier page in the deck, why we should.
And whatever doesn't go to loans is going to go into the securities portfolio.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd then you have the markets business, which also because of the financing activities and equities, not a lot of risk, but notional growth of balance sheet that you've seen.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystYeah.
Our loan and deposit growth, above industry averages and above the market on a conservatively responsible growth basis continues to help offset the NII pressure due to rate changes which is -- which all of you are focused on, it should be.
Our total commercial loans grew 6% compared to the third quarter of '18 with good middle market utilization rates.
On a consumer business on the left hand side of the slide, our deposit growth has consistently been above the average -- the industry average for many periods.It's actually dramatic [Phonetic] that we're gaining market share.
And we're expanding the franchise by being our retail franchise, our consumer banking franchise to markets where you had long established wealth management or commercial client coverage.Paul is going to cover the continued growth and digital uses across our client base, which provides an important deal of benefits of strong customer service and lower cost structures.
Earlier there this quarter, my team mate, Tom Montag highlighted some of the gains we are making in middle market investment banking coverage at a conference.
The value of our leading digital capabilities and our unique preferred rewards program.Global wealth manager was responsible for $16 billion of that $38 billion in consumer deposit growth, reflecting client expansion and preference to hold cash and move investments as well as inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds and deposits at year-end 2018.Our consumer banking deposits grew by $22 billion or 3% year-over-year.
Average loans on line of business had grew $52 billion or 6% year-over-year, as both consumer and commercial loans both grew at a 6% pace.Middle market borrowing as I said earlier, continued to complement large corporate financings.
Within consumer, you'll note that strong residential mortgage growth, but also the more stable credit card balances which reflect our decision last year to continue to manage less profitable promotional balances down or driving core balances and our relationship, especially in preferred rewards capabilities.
Part of that is to have sustainable growth, which it means we self fund our investments and find ways to handle the inflationary cost to keep expenses relatively flat -- while, continue to invest heavily, $3 billion in technology, new branches, new team mates.Slide 6 shows a two-year expense trend here.
Despite the immediate revenue impact of a lower interest rate environment and other revenue challenges with a slowing economy, we have a good track record of generating operational savings, we're able to keep it operating leverage relatively flat, essentially expenses and revenue grew about $500 million less than $500 million each.
The year-over-year improvement reflect solid loan and deposit growth as well as modestly higher average short-term rates year-over-year.As you know lower rates are a headwind.
First, lower short-term rates reduce yields on floating-rate assets and second, because of lower long-term rates, we experienced faster prepayments on mortgage-backed securities, increasing the level of bond premium write-offs.Offsetting these negative impacts were one additional day of interest, loan and deposit growth, reduction in the cost of our long-term debt and a small decline in the interest rate paid on deposits.
While NII improved in Global Markets, results are better assessed by studying together, both NII and trading account profits as client activity from one quarter to the next can shift in mix between these two revenue lines.
In any case, this asset sensitivity increased compared to Q2, driven by the forward curve at the end of September, which was lower than the curve at the end of Q2.Looking forward, on our Q2 earnings call, we reviewed our expectation that net interest income could grow roughly 1% for the full year of 2019 over 2018.
Similar to Q2, we sold some non-core consumer real estate loans where the sales price was above our carrying value due to prior charge-offs.This resulted in recoveries that reduced net charge-offs and provision expense in both Q3 and Q2 this year.
We believe our efficiency ratio of 45%, which is one of the lowest among our peers is driven by our digital delivery platform and simplified product offerings which enables not only ease of use, but also efficiency.Our investments in this business continued at a steady pace and client activity remained strong with it back to loan and deposit growth, as well as consumer spending.
Again this quarter, we added salespeople expanded in new and existing markets, renovated financial centers and improved capabilities for consumers, as well as small businesses.
The low long-term rate environment continue to generate momentum and consumer real estate as new originations nearly doubled from last year to more than $20 billion.
Asset [Indecipherable] segment remained strong as the net charge-off ratio was 118 basis points, down modestly from both last year and the previous quarter.In addition, we saw origination spreads improve in both mortgage and consumer vehicle lending during the quarter.
Consumer investment assets grew $19 billion to $223 billion, a strong client flows were partially offset by market declines.Turning to slide 13, note that our 3% year-over-year improvement in revenue was driven by both NII as well as fees.
Within revenue positive impacts from growth in deposits and loans drove NII higher asset management fees grew year-over-year as fees from AUM flows and market valuations more than offset general pricing pressures.
Mobile channel usage among wealth management household grew 45%.Moving to slide 16, GWIM results reflect continued solid client engagement in both Merrill and the private bank.
AUM flows were nearly $6 billion in Q3 or $21 billion in the past 12 months, boosting AUM balances to a record $1.2 trillion.On the banking side, average deposits of $254 billion were up $16 billion or 7% year-over-year driven by client growth and 2018 year-end conversion of balances from money market funds.
Strong deposit and loan growth reflects the benefits of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years, as well as continued advancements in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services.
A few other items impacted results here, first provision benefit from the recoveries totaling $200 million related to the sale of primary non-core consumer real estate loans totaling $1.8 billion.Second, the elevated litigation expense Brian mentioned is booked here.
There were some adjustments made on the wealth management business, if you look back, last year we had some growth there that we slowed down because it was a little to -- tied to bidding too much rate.They change that process, they flattened out, now they are growing again.
How difficult does it become or does it become more difficult to be more proactive in terms of lowering your deposit costs?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI think back to the -- in the earlier discussion that sort of general guidance we give our teams is you have to get us 3%.
On the wealth management side, we're driving not only the investment cash, but all the transactional cash and you have to think of those as two separate executions and putting team mates investing by putting team mates into the Merrill Lynch offices who can help the client associates and others who have always done a good job, doing better job of getting core checking relationships and mortgages and things like that, which will help.
It seems like a pretty attractive environment or good environment for you guys to take share and suck up demand deposits at maybe a faster rate than some of your peers.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI think, yes, we expect to grow at a faster rate than our peers.
Thanks so much.OperatorOur next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystHey guys, just a quick one, Brian, you mentioned that obviously delivering positive operating leverage gets harder with -- and rate environment where it is, but as you look ahead and you've done this good job of keeping this $53 billion or so, what are the incremental things that become more productive underneath that allows you to fund the incremental investments, like do we transition to other parts of the business becoming more productive or other pieces that yeah have it maybe still haven't yet attack that could still provide that underlying support.
As you think about the overall balance sheet should that grow in line with deposits or are there some opportunities to bring down debt and you'll see a little bit less earning asset growth?Paul M.

bankofamerica,q4,2019,"At the same time, we deployed capital to support growth for our clients, committees and teammates.Let's start on slide 2; I'm referring to the full year results, excluding our third quarter '19 joint venture impairment charge.
The costs saw all these enhancements incorporated [Phonetic] in our run rate of expenses, providing the capacity to keep investing in the future without increasing expenses.Also for 2019, for the third consecutive year, we shared our financial success with our teammates, with special compensation awards to approximately 95% of them, Three years of special compensation awards, totaled over $1.6 billion, in compensation addition to all other bonuses and merit and everything else, allowing our teammates to do more with their families.Last year, we also delivered more than $5 billion of community development and financing for affordable housing, another important local priority, who made more than $250 million of philanthropic contribution to help drive economic mobility, including workforce training and development and many other local priorities, where we help to make a difference.We also completed our 10 year $125 billion environmental business initiative goal in 2019.
Consumers' record level efficiency and customer satisfaction scores reflect our hard work done the right way.Andy Sieg and Katy Knox together run our Global Wealth and Investment Management businesses.
We generated $1 billion plus in quarterly earnings in the quarters of 2019, and topped this quarter $3 trillion in client balances for the first time.Tom Montag and his team across Global Banking, Global Markets franchises are running one of the biggest commercial lending business in the world and were the top market making investment banking platforms.
Returns remained strong in Q4, but the return on assets of 113 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 15%, well above the company's cost of capital.Our results were driven by our team's focus and solid progress on managing what we can control and gaining market share, in an economy that grew at a low single-digit pace.
Client activity remained solid, allowing the benefits of loan and deposit growth to aid in offsetting the negative impact of lower short-term rates over the past three quarters.
Lastly, our TLAC ratio also remained comfortably above our requirements.Looking at how client activity impacted average balances, let's start with deposits on slide 9.
But I would note, the more stable linked quarter balances here as revolver utilization moved a bit lower.We also saw growth in lending to small businesses growing 7% and within consumer, we saw strong growth of residential mortgages.
The benefits of loan and deposit growth coupled with disciplined pricing, mostly offset the impact across short-term rates of a linked quarter 47 basis point decline in the average fed funds rate.
Third, reinvestment rates are expected to dilute securities yields, despite fractionally higher long-end rates.Moving to Q2, we typically experience seasonally lower NII for two reasons; first, we typically see higher interest expense from funding, increased seasonal Global Markets client activity in equities.
With respect to headcount, year-over-year savings from improved processes and workflows allowed us to fund an increase in the number of sales professionals, as our LOBs added nearly 4,000 associates over the past 12 months.With respect to outlook, our expectations for expense in 2020 haven't really changed from where we provided it in 2016.
All else equal, this would lower our CET1 ratio by roughly 20 basis points, but as you know, it is phased into regulatory capital evenly through 2023.Okay; turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 15.
Our efforts to move customers past enrollment to engagement in digital capabilities are stronger than ever, and we believe industry-leading.Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 18; strong results were led by growth across AUM loans and deposits, as well as good market conditions in the quarter, but also reflected the headwinds of lower interest rates.
With $256 billion in deposits, this segment would rank stand-alone as the seventh or eighth largest bank in the U.S. Asset Management fees grew 5% year-over-year due to higher market valuations, and the fees from AUM flows, which more than offset general pricing pressures and lower transactional revenue.Expenses decreased slightly, as investments in sales professionals technology and our brand were more than offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs.
Average deposits rose 3%.Turning to Global Banking on slide 20; the business earned $2 billion and generated a 20% return on allocated capital in the quarter.
Continued strong deposit and loan growth reflects the benefit of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years, increasing our client coverage, as well as continued advancement in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services.
Bank of America was involved in seven of the Top 10 debt deals, and six of the Top 10 equity deals in the quarter, based upon Dealogic data this performance drove a 50 basis point improvement in market share for the full year.Turning to slide 22, one of the reasons for the growth in deposits and Global Banking has been our consistent investment over multiple years in digital capabilities and transaction services.
And just given some of the moderating U.S. and global GDP growth expectations you cited earlier, just trying to think about how we should be modeling or forecasting fee income expectations in the coming years?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerI think each category -- if you think about the broad categories, where most of them come through, the strategy in the consumer business has been to reduce reliance over the last decade plus on penalty fees and things like that.
That's because people are paying us through balances.So I think that Steven, a guy like me who has been around banks for a long time, the differentiation between types of revenue fee versus spread is becoming harder as the business models have morphed them together in just terms of total revenue.
So it's a complex set of things, but hopefully that gives you some colorMike Mayo -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystYeah, I guess I'll try one more time, in terms of [Phonetic] your check number, like you are expanding to new markets, you are opening new branches, you are hiring new associates, how much does this investing increase the growth rate of expenses?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerIt's $3.3 billion.
The only thing that works against that is -- so yes, if you thought about how much is going to sort of new business initiatives, the mobile banking feature functionality, it's higher in 2020 than it was in '19 than it was in '18, largely around this issue that you are running off some of these long-term projects, which is good.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystAll right, thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
We also have to manage our cost base carefully, while making the required investments, and we have to take advantage of a strong balance sheet to provide good capital return to our shareholders.At Bank of America, we checked the box in all of these in the quarter.
The team continues to get its fair share of the fee pools across the globe and became the more important partners for many of the world's largest clients.With a renewed focus, our Investment Banking team had gained some of the lost market share from a couple of years ago, and Paul will give you those numbers later.
At Bank of America, spending by our consumers grew at 5.9% over $3 trillion in spending from 2019 over 2018.We saw solid loan demand in our commercial client base throughout the year, but that moderated in the second half of the year, as worries about global economic uncertainty and all the issues that are talked about, have been dragged on.
Global Banking deposits grew $19 billion or 5% year-over-year, and reflected both our strong GTS platform, and the additional bankers we have deployed over the past couple of years.Looking at average loans on slide 10, we see pretty consistent client activity.
On the other hand, in Global Banking and Wealth Management, the decline from Q3 and the rate paid on interest bearing deposits, was more in line with the 38 basis point drop in average one month LIBOR.Looking forward, as we move into 2020, let me start by saying, our expectations assume a stable economic and interest rate environment, i.e. flat rates relative to the end of the year.
From there, we would expect NII to rise modestly in the second half of the year, driven by an additional day of interest and continued loan and deposit growth.Turning to slide 12 and quarterly expenses over the past two years; at $13.2 billion this quarter, expenses were 1% higher than Q4 '18, as increased investments throughout 2019 in people, real estate and technology initiatives were largely offset by savings from operational excellence and lower amortization of intangibles.
Client investments increased $54 billion, up 29% year-over-year to $240 billion driven primarily by the market, but we also saw $20 billion of client flows and our total net accounts grew 7%.Loans were up a healthy 7%, driven by home loans, debit and credit spending by our customers was up 6% year-over-year, consistent with a record holiday season, and asset quality in this segment remained strong, with a net charge off ratio of 118 basis points, down modestly from last year.Turning to slide 16; I will quickly note continued positive trends across deposits, loans and investments, all of which I touched upon earlier.
So when rates fall, [Indecipherable] feels it, but much of the impact of foreign rates was offset by advisory fees, generated from our industry-leading Wealth Management platform.Net income was just over $1 billion, down 4% from Q4 '18, reflecting lower interest rates and the absence of a prior year gain from the sale of a non-core asset, which also impacted the revenue comparisons.
Global Markets produced $639 million of earnings, year-over-year revenue was up 10%, from both higher sales and trading results, and improved investment banking fees.
We run and invest in the company for the long-term sustainability and for growth, and by the way these investments over many years lay the foundation for operating leverage.So having said all that, we're not blind to changes in the operating environment, but we are also not managing rigidly to quarterly financial metrics.
We are focused on the things that we can control, like driving client activity, deposits, loans, investments, efficiency improvements, we are focused on operational excellence.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerI think it's more a reflection of responsible growth, and how we run -- how we're focused on the customer and how we're focused on total revenue, and not necessarily NII or fees.
So I think that line is going to start to grow from here.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerI think, Glenn, just to be -- with Paul's lost point, production of new customers taking the card product from us and the usage continues to grow.
But there's a lot of things forward, and I think we can continue to improve them.It would appear to be easier -- if in fact rates stay stable and drive loan growth, which is what our projection is, and if rates start rising again, it will -- we will look like heroes in terms of margin, but we've been able to sustain it, even in a falling rate environment.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore -- AnalystThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
But remember, that part of the strategy is to invest in our client base, loyalty to our company and our products, and so there'll be modest, because of the NII growth -- think about 8% growth in checking balances year-over-year in consumer, that is helped driven by people consolidating a relationship with you, what you pay back to the reward system through the card usage.
So got to get revenue slightly faster than the economy and have the expenses grow below that by couple hundred basis points, and we've been able to do that, and as this twist in rates ends this quarter, you'll see us get back on track, as we move through 2020.Steven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThanks for that color, Brian, and maybe just a follow-up for you Paul.
And I'm just wondering, as we prepare for CECL, does that inform your appetite or your willingness to continue down the same path, and just separately, just given the strength of your credit position and a relatively clean balance sheet, was sort of hoping you guys could be CECL pioneers, and maybe the first bank to provide some more concrete guidance, in terms of day two provision impacts or expectations?Paul M.
When you're doing $60 billion in deposit growth and your loan balances grew by $10 billion or whatever -- $10 billion or $20 billion, the other half has to go to be invested somewhere and you're raising this money in all-in costs in the 40 basis points of deposit pricing across the whole board, and a lot of it's coming in non-interest.
Please go ahead.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, good morning.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Betsy.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystBrian, 10 years of excellent management here, driving the bus on improving operating leverage, especially over the past three, four years.
Can you give us a sense, as to how you see the rate of change go from here, because we've had obviously significant improvement in the consumer side, and the question I get from people is, is it over and by the way, how do you generate positive operating leverage in global banks and global markets, given the skew to producers, and is there that much opportunity in the back office side?
Leave aside that the rate environment is low, we've been able to push forward the activities that can produce more efficiency, and we think that there is a lot ahead of us.And so I'd like to -- we'd say nice start to our team, saying thanks for all the hard work you've done.
If you think about the cost of deposits and consumer, I think it went down by 4 basis points year-over-year something like that.So it's a grind, and it's a lot of hard work, but the incremental efficiency that we can get at this scale, by these investments and by the digitization and the further taking out of activity which costs more.
And by the time you get to the third quarter, we would expect, assuming the current sort of economic environment, we would expect our loan and deposit growth, the lack of that seasonality, the deposit pricing to have an effect and we'll start growing again.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerI'd just add to that, your question and John's question go the same direction, which is, you've got this quarter and the first couple of quarters because of the dynamics Paul just described that.
How do we think about when, in the current rate environment, the sort of net interest margin, assuming mix is unchanged, obviously it's a big assumption, but do we assume that NIM starts to stabilize in the second half of this year?Paul M.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerI think if you look at page 9, when you have rate movement due to the types of things that are -- reestablish the reserve levels by the Federal Reserve, etc, etc, etc, that's going to affect the lower -- our markets business in the lower right hand, and banking, stuff like that.
So if you could just put a wrapper around the spending and put a number to it, then we, as analysts, can figure out, OK, a more core efficiency level, if you would.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerSo one of the things that just in our efficiency ratio compared to other people, or 58% for the year.
What are [Indecipherable] and where do you think they are headed?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerYeah, the $3 billion plus, obviously with Brexit behind us with -- by the regulatory environment rules behind us in terms of implementing the CCAR and the capital rules and then lot of modeling, and you're still spending money improving that data to make those models work.
When you move it from the paper to the digital, can you share -- remind us what the cost savings are when you do that, per unit?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerSo that was kind of checks written by our customers, which is this good point, because that stops the thing before it starts.
If you could comment on that, if you're seeing that in your customer base as well?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerI'll take the second half and I will let Paul.
So that's just smaller, so I think that helps the overall nominal growth for the company.Brian Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive OfficerIt's going to be $1.5 billion, $2 billion a quarter.Matt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay.
",24.72,0.6772105
bankofamerica,q1,2020,"Global Markets client's needs for liquidity temporarily increased our balance sheet during the quarter by as much as $130 billion from year-end.
Small business originations, not from any of the special programs were $2.4 billion during this quarter, showing support for that segment of the economy.We also met our larger commercial borrowing customers' demands with commercial loans increasing $67 billion as clients drew down against their unfunded commitments and new commitments were made.
And as you know, during the quarter we voluntary chose to suspend the buyback portion of those distributions to share capital for expected customer growth.We did all of that and our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.8% still finished 130 basis points above our 9.5% minimum.
Driving that increase was deposits, increasing $149 billion, far exceeding our $67 billion expansion in our loan portfolio.Moving away from the balance sheet and onto earnings, a couple of highlights, I'd point out and I finished a bit better than expected at $12.3 billion on an FTE basis, flat with fourth quarter.
As those markets opened up, we also saw a strong debt capital markets issuance to support clients.In fact, March ended up being the business month ever for U.S. high-grade market with approximately $260 billion of total issuances.
Again the investments made over the past years to our trading platforms delivered more speed and capacity to make that possible, and all doing we'll remain at maintaining good controls.The clients we serve in that business had witnessed severe volatility markets and we are providing liquidity when they need it.
45% of these fundings came from large commercial clients; 40% were from large corporate bank customers and remainder is spread across all the businesses.As for the asset quality what we funded 92% of these were collateralized or were made to investment grade clients and less than a $100 million were made to clients as loans became non-performing.
Year-over-year average growth has been consistently in the mid-single-digit range and early Q1 trends were similar to that, note the significant increases across consumer and GWIM which was driven by residential mortgage, given continued low interest rates.This quarter we originated $19 billion in first mortgage loans retaining 94% on our books.
Average credit card loans were down a bit more than the typical seasonality given the drop-off in consumer spending later in the quarter, while customer payment rates continued at a fairly steady pace.
The lower rates also allowed us to price our deposits more efficiently in wealth management and global banking.Before I discuss our forward view of NII, I want to emphasize that future NII results will be influenced by interest rates as well as loan and deposit balances which will likely be highly influenced by the virus' impact on the economy.
On the short end, one month LIBOR, which impacted variable-rate loan pricing as well as longer term rates which impacted mortgage and mortgage-related assets have both dropped nearly 80 basis points on a spot basis.As you think about our NII for the rest of the year.
Banking book sensitivity from an instantaneous parallel drop of 100 basis points in rate at that time was estimated to reduce NII by $6.5 billion over the following 12 months.
Since these rates moved less than 100 basis points, the change in NII over the next 12 months is likely to be less than $6.5 billion.I would also note some additional items to consider that are expected to mitigate some of that decline.
Considering all these factors, particularly the virus' impact on the economy and interest rates, we believe NII could approach $11 billion in Q2 and then begin to stabilize with loan and deposit growth mitigating the negative impacts of longer-term asset repricing.Turning to Slide 12 and expenses; at $13.5 billion this quarter, expenses were up 2%.
As you all know, what really impacts banks in recession is not the loans put on your books during stress, but rather the quality of your portfolio booked during the year's leading up to stress.One independent indicator of the relative quality of our balance sheet is the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR stress test.
And our consistent focus on asset quality has been reflected in our results for many years now.Adjusted for the recoveries of loan sales in some periods as described before, we have reported net charge-offs between $900 million and $1 billion for many quarters.
Total net charge-offs this quarter were $1.1 billion or 46 basis points of average loans.
Having said that, given the rise in unemployment claims, we do expect consumer losses to increase later this year and potentially into 2021.Turning to Slide 15, this table provides a full picture of our allowance increased since 12/31/19, including the 01/01/20 implementation of CECL as well as this quarter's build given the worsening economic conditions.
Average loans increased 8% and we continue to add consumer investment accounts and saw solid flows into our Merrill Edge platform.Let's skip Slide 18 as I think I covered much of the trends on Slide 17 already, the ability of our customers to connect through digital banking has never been more important.
But here again pre-tax, pre-provision income was down a more modest 4%.Revenue grew 2% year-over-year as a strong increase in AUM fees and brokerage fees were partially offset by a decline in NII as a result of lower interest rates.
Expenses increased from revenue related incentives as well as investments we made in the past 12 months in sales professionals, technology and our brand.Okay, let's skip Slide 20 and move to global banking on Slide 21.
Lastly, COVID-related credit costs are higher in this segment as the reserve build was more heavily weighted to commercial loans.The business earned $36 million which included adding $1.9 billion to the allowance for credit losses.
On a pre-tax pre-provision income basis, results declined 21% driven by lower interest rates and by roughly $450 million of net markdowns in the value of loans and underwritten commitments recorded at fair value and our capital market books and FVO books.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah.Mike Mayo -- Wells Fargo Securities, LLC -- AnalystWell, just -- how much -- I mean, how much more could the reserves get built into the second quarter?
As you think about our quarter, our decade-plus long discipline of responsible growth has resulted in a strengthening our balance sheet and making investments in technology and people and talent over the decade has helped us prepare for this environment.Today, we're going to do three things with you.
This was led by the reserve build.I think it's useful to draw your attention to the pre-tax pre-provision income line as we believe it helps illustrate the underlying earnings power of the Company to support the credit costs that are inevitable in a downturn.
And in fact that would have shown that the economy this quarter probably is going to grow faster than people expected.That changed as the virus spread and you can see that -- the impact here on Slide 6.
The request have come down in every one of the last three weeks.And as we've seen -- we turned to April, draw request, new credit request have mitigated these -- at these levels, We're seeing client's attentions turn from securing liquidity to more structured view of their capital position and their needs to better understand how they will prosper and fare in the COVID-19 impact to business model.We observed earlier that as commercial paper market froze the middle of the quarter, as new round of buyers where some clients were unable to access the CPP markets, as the Fed announced their programs we saw that market stabilize and over time here, we've seen it lengthen out so draws can be for long periods of time.It's worth noting, since we have one of the premier global treasury services platform in the world, we saw many of those draws come back in our balance sheet as deposits.
Deposit growth in excess of our loan growth was invested primarily in cash or cash equivalents.As Brian mentioned, the team did an incredible job of not only providing our global markets clients, the needed liquidity from a mid-March spike, but also reducing those levels by the end of the quarter.
I will skip the discussion on average deposits on Slide 8 and move to Slide 9.Earlier, Brian also discussed our loan growth near the end of the quarter, which was driven by revolver draws.
And last, the asset sensitivity of the banking book does not include the benefits to NII of the trading book, which is a little liability sensitive.With that said, we would expect the largest decline in NII over the balance of 2022 to impact Q2, as the bulk of the repricing of our variable-rate loans should happen fairly quickly.
Compared to Q4 '19, expense increased roughly $250 million, reflecting nearly $400 million in seasonally elevated payroll tax expense.With respect to our outlook, we are still assessing the impacts, both positive and negative, that the virus has had on the Company's expenses and as such are not in a position to provide any updates to our previous expectation that expense would be in the mid-$53 billion range this year.
Our reserve build of $3.6 billion reflects the expected increase and life of loan losses given the weaker current and expected economic conditions as a result of the virus.On Slide 14 we breakout the credit quality metrics for both consumer and commercial portfolios.
These ratios reflect our underwriting standards over the past 10 years as well as our loan mix with a large concentration of secured consumer loans.We size the increase to our allowance in the quarter by weighting a number of different scenarios, all of which assumed a recession of various depth and longevity, including an assumption of some tail risk, similar to what is in the severely adverse scenarios.
And as you heard that -- and as you heard, that moved higher in the last few weeks of the quarter.We learned a lot from our digital auto and mortgage experiences and what we learned enabled us to quickly launch a digital pathway for our small businesses to apply for loans in the paycheck protection program.Turning to Wealth -- turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 19; here again, we saw lower rates and COVID-19 related credit cost impact an otherwise solid quarter.
Growth in investment banking fees, loans, and deposits reflected not only what we believe to be a flight to quality in uncertain times, but also the addition of hundreds of bankers over the past few years, increasing and improving client coverage.Turning to Slide 22, Brian covered the most important points around loan and deposit growth, I just want to reiterate one point.
Not only were we able to capture as deposits the bulk of the cash that customers drew on the revolvers that wasn't used to pay down debt or for other purposes, we were also able to attract billions more in additional deposits even as pricing deposits lowered with falling rates.Turning to Slide 23, as in consumer and GWIM, our digital capabilities are more important and useful than ever, enabling clients to work from home and seamlessly manage their treasury needs and it's no surprise that in this environment, we continue to see increased use of these capabilities.Switching to Global Markets on Slide 24.
I know we've been through stress test here for 10 years now, and it would just be helpful to understand how you decided to size this very significant increase in the reserve and how you think it trajects from here?Brian T.
I went back and started saying sort of are we sure how much different we are and you people forget things that it won't mean a lot to the people on the phone, the Gold Option Program, which was a restructuring card debt that went on in the mid-2000s.That was -- it started going into the crisis in 2008 time frames at $25 billion, eight quarters later or six quarters later something like that, it's down to $12 billion.
Donofrio -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I mean just to be clear, what I said was it's a significant drop in GDP in the second quarter and then negative GDP growth to extend well into 2021 I think approaching all the way to the end of the year.
We are developing scenarios based upon the information we had at the end of the quarter, but it is interesting and it may be helpful for all of you in terms of comparing reserves to really think about the loan mix, the quality of the portfolio and then, of course, what people assumed about the future.
So our reserve build reflects what we think as of the end of this quarter we're going to have to have in losses for the life of the assets on our books.Now, when we get to the end of the second quarter, we may have a different view of the future.
It's just a little premature to call anything, Mike.And so that's the factors we're looking at as we look at not only, to your point about how you said, potential losses based on our customer base and their behavior and what happens to them; but also based on our view of the economy opening up and frankly our advice to people who wonder as to what parts of the economy could have a faster impact with less -- they're the healthcare experts but with less risk of people congregating versus others that might help support a reopening of good activity.Go back to the dentists or something like that you know that can put dentist back to work that will open up part of the economy that is usually not closed down for these things and it's a relatively few number of people in a given space at a given time.
The -- if you look at U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial in and around 1%, that's obviously a lot more than we've had lately but not necessarily the worst thing you could predict, given the world we're looking at.So I guess my question is, when you talk about the quality and the mix of business and all the things that you gave us, is the -- what I consider not as severe reserve on the commercial side a function of not knowing the timing, the mix of business or it where you sit in the capital stack meaning even if some of those companies who run into issues your historical experience in last bunch of years has been actually really, really good.
Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board & Chief Executive OfficerLook, we've got 2.16% on commercial real estate, given how we have run our commercial real estate business over the last 10 years, especially relative to others, we feel that's up from 1.6% at January 1.
Let's go back to the beginning on the pre-tax PPNR which we all learned at the last crisis that; is that earnings power to absorb pay as you go losses on the consumer side in terms of card charge-offs and things like that or building reserves and then going through on the commercial side, which is what happens typically?That earnings power is, I think, what we feel has us in good stead in terms of the ability -- the ability to absorb whatever circumstances play out here and still with more liquidity than the start of the year, more capital than we need, a 130 basis points more capital and the PPNR volume that lets us drive through it.
And if you think about that PPNR, when you look at this stress test and stuff, we are running a lot higher than those stress tests assume because they assume there's market losses and things like that, which we didn't experience even in the one of the most volatile periods of time in the market's history.And so I think as you play this out that whether we can all talk about the reserve of X or Y or Z per thing, which is what you should -- you all are focused on and should be focused on, the route is, is how much earnings capacity you have to keep generating capital and keep generating earnings that you can offset whatever comes at you and that's what we feel good about.Glenn Schorr -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystThank you, both.Brian T.
But I would think as you kind of look to the back half this year and beyond, some of those line drawdowns in commercial start to get paid off so that maybe it's tougher to grow the balance sheet or maybe it's tougher to grow loans if that's the right way to think about it.Brian T.
Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board & Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I mean there is no question that commercial revolver lines which spiked in March will start to pay down once economic conditions start to improve, but obviously the timing of that is very uncertain.
All that's factored into our perspective that we think with loan and deposit growth we can -- you will see NII kind of at that $11 billion level, give or take roughly through the end of the year.Ken Usdin -- Jefferies -- AnalystSo when you say, with all the cash that's sitting on the balance sheet and like you said earlier, you're expecting some tapering of that.
Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board & Chief Executive OfficerJust start on that, just -- generally customers put more cash and you saw that in the wealth management deposits being up $19 billion.
My guess is two-thirds of that was more what you're speaking about a third or so was sort of the core growth building up that we saw coming into the tail end of last year into the quarter, maybe a little less than that.But a lot of it was moving.
Moynihan -- Chairman of the Board & Chief Executive OfficerNo. Okay, another one, and small business, the deferrals that you've seen so far probably going to rise.
