creditsuisse,q2,2019,"Let's look at our 2Q performance in more detail on the next slide, please.So, two quarters post our restructuring, we believe that the operating leverage which we created in those three years is starting to bear fruit.
In Wealth Management, our revenues have remained resilient in difficult markets reflecting the strength of our diversified franchise and the effectiveness of our ultra-high net worth focus.
We have been able to build on our strong first-quarter inflows in light blue here and generated 9.5 billion CHF of net new asset in the second quarter in dark blue here.
Let's look now at how this has translated more importantly not only in earning but also in pre-tax income on the next slide.Over the last three years, we have grown our Wealth Management related pre-tax income at a CAGR of 15% achieving a pre-tax income of 2.6 billion CHF in the first half of 19.
Moving on to IWM, we delivered a resilient performance with strong net new asset inflows across both private banking and asset management delivering a return on capital of 29% at the bottom here of the page.
This is the first time since 2015 that we do so and roughly 2/3 of those are focused on emerging markets to accelerate our growth going forward and this may explain to some of you why the costs in IWM were up year on year, 70 RMs hired.In APAC we had a strong quarter with revenues up 9% both year on year and sequentially for Wealth Management and Collective.
You can see that the benefits of these actions are starting to come through in our Q1 performance and even more so in our 2Q performance on the next slide.Looking at the second quarter, we have been able to grow revenues in both equities and fixed income and sales and trading and outperforming the Street and gaining market share.
I would now like to take you through our financial results in more detail.For the second quarter, Credit Suisse had net revenues of 5.6 billion CHF broadly flat against the same quarter of last year.
This lead to a 30% reduction in revenues.If we turn to costs, as we said before, we remain committed to delivering year on year productivity increases across our businesses and our operations, with the pace of reinvestment depending on the market and economic environment.
Including the benefit of the reduction in the tax rate, net income attributable to shareholders stood at 937 million CHF in the second quarter, up by 45% year on year.
Again, well above our target level which as you know is to exceed 5%.Looking at risk-weighted assets, they increased by 1 billion CHF to 291 billion CHF at the end of the second quarter.
The Swiss Universal Bank generated 1.48 billion CHF of revenue, up by 4% year on year including the gain from the real estate in the quarter that Tidjane referred to.
Included in the Swiss real estate game, that resulted in a pre-tax profit of 654 million CHF for the second quarter of 2019, equivalent to a return on regulatory capital of 20%.
We saw a further good performance in terms of net new asset accretion in both our private clients and our corporate institutional client businesses across the first half of the year.
That's lifted CNIC assets under management to 411 billion CHF up by 15% year on year at the end of the second quarter.Let's turn to slide 32 to look at International Wealth Management.
Our IWM division delivered a robust second quarter with revenues of 1.37 billion CHF an increase of 2% year on year and a 3% increase in pre-tax income to 444 million CHF.
The quarter also saw a record NNA level in IWM's private banking segment with 5.5 billion CHF of net inflows in the second quarter.
If we look at Wealth Management in connected, we saw a continued strong performance across our main businesses, private banking advisory, underwriting, and financing.
Overall, we made a pre-tax profit of 216 million CHF in WMC, an increase of 29% compared to the same quarter of last year.In private banking, we saw net new assets of 2.8 billion CHF in the second quarter following on from the 5.0 billion CHF that we received in the first quarter to take the total to 7.8 billion CHF for the first half of the year.
However, combined with a cumulative benefit of the cost measures that we undertook during the quarter of 2018, we reduced total operating expenses year on year by 7% in our Markets operations leading to a pre-tax income of $21 million for the quarter.Let's turn please to slide 34 and the Investment Banking and Capital Markets division.
As you've already seen, fees across the Street fell by 23% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter of last year and our advisory business was impacted by a reduction in the number of transactions that we closed in the period.
We reduced expenses by 15% year on year to $447 million and this combined with the increase in revenues quarter on quarter resulted in a return to profit in the second quarter.Finally, let us conclude, please, with Global Markets.
We saw good momentum across all of our business, which combined with continued discipline in terms of expense and capital resource usage as well as the benefit of the reduction in funding costs that we talked about last year.
We've remained very disciplined with the deployment of capital to the GM business with RWA and leverage uses similar to the level seen in the second quarter of 2018 and that resulted in a return on registered capital of 11% for the quarter and as Tidjane has mentioned 17% in terms of the return on risk-weighted assets.With that, I would like to hand back to Tidjane to close the presentation, please.Tidjane Thiam-Chief Executive OfficerThank you, David.
Navigating through these markets requires our teams to stay close to our clients executing on transactions when windows of opportunity present themselves.On the next slide, in the environment we just described, we have continued in Q2 to grow group net income, as you can see here, reaching 937 million CHF in the second quarter.
And this takes our bottom line close to a billion CHF for the quarter with a 45% year on year increase and it is our highest quarterly net income since 2Q 15 four years ago.On the next slide, you remember that at our 2018 Investor day we outlined a path to drive our returns higher even in a challenging revenue environment.
So, I think a lot of the things we're doing ourselves, as Tidjane has referred to already, will actually benefit us.Tidjane Thiam-Chief Executive OfficerThen you asked what's the role of ITS in the equities progress.
And I say in my remarks, I believe our PTI at 164 million CHF in our Private Bank is the highest in Asia in absolute terms this quarter, although some players are much bigger than we are.
I think that's the most I can tell you at this point in time.Daniele Brupbacher -- UBS -- AnalystYes. No, that's good.Tidjane Thiam-Chief Executive OfficerYes. I would merely say that we will exceed both of those numbers, both in total and for the Global Markets division.
I think it is noteworthy that the RM count was up by 70 net in terms of those numbers, but do keep it in the context on page 45, please.Tidjane Thiam-Chief Executive OfficerYes. But it will remain a high return on capital business, which is really how we drive the business.
We achieved this during the second quarter when markets remained challenging as we will see on the next slide, please.So, while equity market on the left in green here has performed strongly in the first half of 19 and are at or near all-time highs globally, credit spreads on the right remain at elevated levels compared to the same period in 2018 even if they started decreasing in June.
We believe that the sustained reduction in fixed costs that we have achieved lowering crucially our breakeven point and our continued focus on productivity improvements leave us well-positioned to benefit from improving market conditions with any uptick in revenues dropping directly to our bottom line.So, let's move to the operating performance of our businesses in more detail and I'll start with general comments about our Wealth Management franchise and performance.
Our broad range of capabilities gives us various options to generate client revenues which have proven very valuable in challenging markets as we have seen in Q1 and Q2.Let's look now at our asset flows on the next slide.
To put this performance into perspective, we have added organically the equivalent of a mid-sized asset manager or private bank for asset inflows alone.Let's look now at the development of our Wealth Management net revenues on the next slide, please.
As you see on the right here, we believe that we can more or less double the revenues with an ultra-high net worth client that are pure pay Wealth Manager would generate in dark green here.
This slide illustrates the interest of our integrated one-stop-shop approach with a case of a leading Asian ultra-high net worth entrepreneur client whom I've met many times and who has become increasingly active with us as his business has grown exponentially over the past years.
We also added in 1H 19, and this is important, 70 experienced RMs. We saw higher revenue growth across all of our three business, Private Banking, IBCM, and Financing, with APAC private banking delivering its second-highest revenue quarter ever.
In APAC IBCM we achieved the 11th consecutive quarter with revenues above 200 million CHF and we were ranked number one in advisory and underwriting for APAC ex-Japan as well as for the first time ever number one in the share of wealth for greater China.
Finally, ATS, the newly created ATS, APAC Trading Solutions, our regional setup to deliver asset and liability solutions for our ultra-high net worth clients is off to a good start with already five deals in the quarter and a high level of client engagement across the region.You can see here, we have generated strong results across all our Wealth Management businesses in 2Q and as you can see on the next slide we believe there are significant further growth opportunities.
So, on the next slide having defined a clear strategy of being the leading Wealth Manager with strong investment banking capabilities, we believe that having a strong Global Markets business was key.
We are reestablishing our historic electric trading relationships and adding new prime mandates.Moving on to Fixed Income Sales and Trading revenues were up by 11% in 2Q with a strong performance from our leading products which benefited from lowest rates and credit franchises.
We achieved a PTI of $359 million in 2Q which represents our best quarterly performance since 2Q 15 when we had more capital and a different risk profile.We said that post-restructuring the return to Global Market would increase and they have as is presented on the next slide.
We are gaining market share in key products and we are driving returns higher.To wrap up here, I wanted to pause to congratulate our teams across the globe and highlight some of the recognition they received for our client-focused integrated approach.
Our Wealth Management related revenues increased by 4% compared to the second quarter of 2018 a reflection of strength across all three divisions.
Revenues in our Markets activities rose by 3% year on year while our IBCM division continued to suffer both from the reduced industrywide levels of primary issuance and from the bias in M&A closings toward the final quarter of the year.
That includes an increase of 8 billion CHF primarily in our Wealth Management related divisions, offset by 12 billion CHF of currency moves.Let's turn to cost, please, on slide 30.
In terms of underlying business trends compared to the second quarter of last year, we saw some improvement in transaction revenues offset by weaker recurring revenues as well as some pressure on net interest income.
Operating expense was reduced by 2% to 812 million CHF with a cost-income ratio of 55%.Let me turn now to net new assets.
Whilst we remain very focused on continuing to increase the productivity of relationship managers both in terms of revenues and assets under management, I would note that since the fourth quarter of 2018 we've expanded by a net of 70 relationship managers.
I'd also remind you that in the first quarter of 2019, IWM's operating expenses were reduced in part by the release of certain litigation provisions.Private banking revenues were stable reflecting continued robust client activity and a higher dividend from SIX offset by a lower net in interest income and recurring fees as we saw clients move away from alternative assets to more risk-averse products such as fixed-income similar to the trends that we saw in the Swiss Universal Bank.
The 5.5 billion CHF of NNA equates to an annualized growth rate of 6% largely from ultra-high net worth clients with solid inflows in both emerging markets and in Europe.Now, turning to asset management we saw strong net new asset inflows of 8.6 billion CHF across both traditional and alternative investments.
Net revenues in our Asia Pacific division were broadly stable at 913 million CHF in the second quarter while pre-tax income increased by 9% to 237 million CHF.
That leaves us with total assets under management of 219 billion CHF for the Asia Pacific region.Our Markets business continued to be adversely affected by the weakness in trading volumes across the Asian markets.
I'd return to what we said last quarter, our investment bankers remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook and we continue to have a significant pipeline of deals to close albeit it is likely that the revenue recognition from these deals will be weighted toward the end of the year.Clearly, given these market conditions, IBCM remained very focused on cost discipline.
That means that total pre-tax income for the first half of 2019 for GM came to $642 million.Looking first at fixed income, we saw trading revenues in GM up by 11% which compares to an average decline of 7% in US dollar terms so far posted to the close of last night by American and European peers.
It was a good performance credit overall but particularly for our securitized product operations where we continue to see further opportunities to grow this business.
Like our peers, we did see lower revenues in equity derivatives but this was offset by an improved return on assets in our prime business and by market share gains elsewhere.Turning to costs, we continue to see the benefits from our past restructuring measures with total operating expenses falling by 7% year on year to $1.2 billion for the quarter.
This was based on executing against a number of known actions and we had said that we expected that we could achieve 10% return on tangible equity in a flat revenue environment because we didn't want to embed any strong revenue assumptions in our assessment.
We expect market sentiment to continue to be impacted by geopolitical uncertainty and punctuated by periods of lower client activity that will not surprise anybody.Finally, before we take your questions, Adam Gishen has asked me to make one more announcement.
Sorry, the same numbers if I may just in terms of ultra net new money and in cash wealth management.Tidjane Thiam-Chief Executive OfficerIt varies from one quarter to another, but yeah.
That's why we keep talking about it because it's really core to the strategy and the performance and that's also where our emphasis on trading capability, execution platform, Global Market, IBCM, really makes sense because for all the ultras it's extremely important.David Mathers-Chief Financial OfficerAnd cash balances in Asia was 26%.
I think what we said last year is that the restructuring measures we took, together with the runoff of certain positions within the SRU would reduce our group's funding cost by at least $700 million, of which at least $300 million would actually be in the Global Markets division.I'm not really going to add to that now.
David, do you want to take the gross margin?David Mathers-Chief Financial OfficerYes. I think, Andrew, I mentioned it actually in my comments that we had an 87 million CHF real estate gain in Switzerland here in the second quarter.
And it's had its 10th consecutive quarter of year on year revenue growth driven by strong new issue volumes.And finally, the kind of fixed income, linked to wealth management also did OK despite a very high comparative in 2Q 18.
Is it now more sort of net increases in cost as you make investments with attractive returns?Tidjane Thiam-Chief Executive OfficerYes. No.
",39.23,0.6540229
creditsuisse,q3,2019,"Credit spreads, on the right, have remained at somewhat elevated levels, while we saw continued lower activity levels in ECM, Equity Capital Markets, and leveraged finance, products where we have historically enjoyed a leading market position.In 3Q, going into some of the geographies, we have seen a slowdown in Asia primary and M&A activity, primarily in Greater China with one of the lowest-activity quarters in the last five years in terms of market fee pool.
This combined with the strength of our private client and Private Banking franchise, brought our total divisional nine-month NNA to a record level of CHF47 billion this year.So after SUB, let's move now to International Wealth Management, where we had a good quarter.
Our Asset Management franchise is one of the highest-returning businesses at Credit Suisse, with a return on regulatory capital of 33%.So let's look now at APAC Wealth Management & Connected on the next slide.
So overall, it's the highest PTI quarter ever for our private bank in Asia.In addition, looking at IBCM, we hold the Number 1 market share in APAC underwriting and advisory this year at October 15.
Looking forward, our IBCM teams believe that their improved pipeline will lead over time to an improvement in our performance versus The Street.Next comes a slide that we've used a few times with you, at the 2018 Investor Day, moving on to Global Markets, we presented a path to improving our returns in Global Markets and identified a number of revenue initiatives to achieve this, as we felt that a priority after the deep restructuring was to grow revenue: increasing collaboration with wealth management through ITS, benefiting from a reinvigorated Equities platform and lower funding cost, which is a big benefit because GM has no natural funding and we carried for a number of years very expensive funding, of which GM was the main -- was carrying the weight of, if you wish.
So GM has been able to generate this performance without taking more risk in absolute terms and by making also the capital work harder, they have significantly increased in particular capital velocity, which has been a big area of focus, with very good results.So looking at our aggregated Investment Banking footprint.
As you know, we do provide more segmental disclosure on our individual Investment Banking businesses compared to our peers before -- because we think that that is the right management structure to manage a business well, as some of these results show, but in order to assess the overall progress that we have achieved across the franchise, it is helpful to look at the aggregate global IB performance beyond the existing divisions.
Significantly lower funding costs and the completion of the restructuring provide a continued tailwind for our global IB franchise going forward.So before I hand over to David, I'd just like to summarize our performance this quarter on the next slide.
We've now completed this change and realigned our capital hedging strategy, which leads to a higher proportion of our capital being held in US dollars rather than in Swiss francs.Given the spread that exists in the interest rate curve between US dollars and Swiss francs, that is expected to lead to an initial gain of approximately CHF60 million of additional net interest income in the fourth quarter of the current year.
Just looking forward, I'd also remind you that we expect this NII benefit to continue into the future, with an estimated 50 basis point contribution to the return on tangible equity in 2020.Let's turn to costs, please, on Slide 33.
Throughout this period, we've continued to fund strategic investments for growth across the bank as well as further investments intended to improve front-to-back digitalization efforts and to boost our overall productivity.Let me turn to tangible book value per share please on Slide 34.
Whilst the interest rate environment remains challenging here in Switzerland, I'm pleased to say that our transaction activities, although seasonally lower than the second quarter, shows an improvement on last year's level, while recurring revenues were stable.
In September, in common with certain other Swiss banks, we informed our Private Banking and our corporate clients with deposits greater than CHF2 million that they would start to incur a negative interest rate as a result of the continued negative rate environment in our home country.We believe this is the appropriate balance in terms of continuing to shield our retail customers here in Switzerland from negative interest rates while also protecting the overall profitability of our franchise for shareholders.We saw substantial pension fund inflows into our corporate and institutional client business totaling CHF6.3 billion of net new assets in the third quarter, and these inflows lifted C&IC assets under management to CHF425 billion by the end of the third quarter.With that, let's turn to Slide 36 please, to look at IWM.
Private Banking delivered net new assets of CHF3.6 billion, while Asset Management CHF5.9 billion.Overall operating expenses increased by 4% to CHF908 million, including the cost of the increased number of relationship managers who we've hired during the year.
However, advisory, underwriting and financing revenues for Asia Pacific fell by 18% year-on-year, reflecting the significantly lower M&A and equity underwriting activities across the industry in APAC.And I'd also note that the WM&C business saw an increase in credit provisions to CHF20 million in the quarter, including a final provision relating to the default last year of an Indian infrastructure company.
However, our Markets business in Asia Pacific continued to be adversely impacted by the weakness in trading volumes across Asia and by difficult conditions generally.On a US dollar basis, equity sales and trading revenues fell by 11% year-on-year, approximately in line with our understanding of market performance, but our fixed income business saw a much sharper fall in revenues to only $17 million in the quarter.
Our fixed income business saw a very strong performance across the credit franchise, with revenues increasing by 43%.
I think the balance sheet has sort of stabilized there, so I'm not sure if you can do more there or I know you're looking for more progress on cross-selling derivatives into wealth there, but I'm just wondering if you can help us quantify what difference that can really make and kind of what the blue sky scenario can really be for the APAC markets.And then secondly, in IWM, have you got more hiring planned there?
David, I think you highlighted [Technical Issues] of deposits to which Credit Suisse now applies negative --Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerSorry, Jernej, we lost you for 10 seconds, so can you just go back to the question on Slide 35, please?
Wealth management Asia, can we talk a little bit about environment in terms of cash holding, deleveraging process and also investor appetite and -- for taking risk and transacting with you both on the lending side as well as on -- clearly on the transaction side on the traditional business?And then secondly, on the Investment Bank, you clearly make a very strong point here of Investment Banking improvement and particularly in fixed income business, but the ROE is still below 10% if I would add the Global Markets business on top -- sorry, the Investment Banking business that's loss making, Asia loss making.
That's where you've seen a decrease of something like 39% but not on the PB side.Kian Abouhossein -- JPMorgan -- AnalystThank you very much.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd maybe just one final one, just reflecting on a discussion we just had on the environment.
So, what I said on the 2nd is that our total expected increase in net interest income across both wealth management and the Markets businesses for 2020 would be approximately CHF350 million compared to 2018.
Maybe it's a question for December.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerAs I said, I mean, we'll come back December, but the numbers haven't actually changed versus since we spoke last December, so...Jeremy Sigee -- Exane -- AnalystAll right.
And then, secondly, maybe you can elaborate on the initial discussions, I know it's early days, of your relationship managers with clients that are being charged negative rates; and more broadly, with less-attractive cash holdings globally, how these discussions are going to moving into higher-margin product for you?
I mean there's no question that we are cautious, and we need to see then, by the time we come to Investor Day, what it means more precisely for 2020.Anke Reingen -- Royal Bank of Canada -- AnalystThank you very much.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerOkay.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerI think one point I would -- I'm sorry.
For a detailed discussion of our results, we refer you to the Credit Suisse third quarter 2019 financial report.With that, I will now hand over to Tidjane, who will run through the numbers.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Adam, and good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining our call.
We believe that our 2019 results year-to-date support this assertion notwithstanding the fact that Q3 is, for us, typically a seasonally weak quarter.So in Q3, we generated pre-tax income of CHF1.1 billion, up 70%, 70%, and net income of CHF881 million, up 108% year-on-year, leading us to a return on tangible equity, an RoTE of 9%, double the RoTE of the same quarter one year ago which was 4.5%.We have been able to grow our tangible book value, and we have continued our share buyback program, leading to an increase in tangible book value per share, and more on that later.
But first, let's look at the context in which we operated during the third quarter on the next slide.The interest rate environment, on the left here, has continued to be a headwind for some of our clients and has weighed, on the one hand, negatively on market sentiment and investment decisions while being, on the other hand, supportive of debt refinancing and debt issuance.
We have delivered our twelfth consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage in the challenging environment of the third quarter, with revenue up 2%, on the left here, and costs down 1% year-on-year.So moving now to net income on the next slide.
The cost of the SRU wind down, the restructuring charges, legacy fines and litigation expenses as well as capital raises, which were both key and indispensable elements of the restructuring, had led to a significant reduction in tangible book value between 2015 and 2018, and that was the strategy.Since the start of '19, though, we have been able to achieve a material increase in profit, and therefore, in the first nine months of this year, we have been able to increase our tangible book value, the absolute tangible book value, by CHF1.2 billion, and to grow our tangible book value per share at a 9% CAGR, taking it above CHF16.
In nine months '19, we have attracted net new assets of CHF72 billion across wealth and asset management, an increase of 28% compared to the same period last year.Looking at our individual wealth management focused businesses, which is SUB private client, IWM private bank and APAC private bank, we have grown assets respectively as you see on the right here at nine months at 3%, 4% and 7% rate, a strong performance for a player of our scale.
We feel that, although there is often an understandable focus on our ability to save costs, we have also delivered on our growth agenda for those activities that we choose to grow.So on the next slide, we're giving you some insights on the components of our wealth management revenue.
David will talk about this in more detail, but we have continued our prudent approach to loan growth and we have also taken measures to protect our deposit margin through repricing.A particular bright spot for us was our transaction-based revenues, up 19%, 19 -- 19% in APAC private bank and 16% in IWM and about 12% year-on-year in total, particularly driven by the continued strength in ITS.
So overall, on the right here, we have increased our wealth management revenue by 3% year-on-year in a challenging quarter.So let's now turn to our divisions, starting with SUB, the Swiss Universal Bank.
And I want to salute here our IWM teams; and Philipp Wehle, for his first quarter as CEO of IWM, and who produced very good results.We have also performed strongly in our Asset Management franchise, as we can see on the next slide, which we want to give more emphasis to this time in these results because it's -- maybe a part of the business we haven't talked enough about in the past.
So yes, we have -- the revenues have gone down but much less so than the market, and we actually gained share of wallet.So now let's talk about wealth management.
In prime, we have been able to continue to improve our return on asset, and that's the third consecutive quarter where we do so.Simply put, we are generating more revenues in Global Markets with less balance sheet, and we believe that we continue to gain market share and increase our share of wallet without mobilizing more capital.
We have grown tangible book value per share at a 9% CAGR since 2018 and we have returned CHF1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first nine months of the year.And with that, I will now hand over to David.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Tidjane.
Good morning, everybody, and I'd now like to take you through our financial results in some more detail.So for the third quarter, Credit Suisse had net revenues of CHF5.3 billion, an increase of 9% compared to the same quarter of last year, that includes the initial benefit of CHF327 million relating to the first phase of the transfer of InvestLab, our open architecture B2B investment fund platform, to the Allfunds Group.
Now if we exclude the initial gain from the transfer, our revenues totaled CHF5.0 billion, which was an increase of 2% year-on-year.If we look at our business lines.
I think this growth demonstrates the strength and the resilience of our franchise across all three of our wealth management-related businesses.If we look at our other operations.
In Global Markets, however, as Tidjane has highlighted already, we have continued to see the benefits of the investments that we've made into this business and of the substantial restructuring that we finished by the end of 2018 as well as a favorable operating environment, which led to revenues increasing by 34% year-on-year.We remain very committed to delivering year-on-year productivity increases across our businesses and our operations, as well as to careful resource management.
Now including the benefit from the reduced tax rate, our net income attributable to shareholders stood at CHF881 million in the third quarter, an increase of 108% year-on-year, that equates to a return on tangible equity of 9% for both the third quarter and for the nine months to the end of September.Next, let's turn to Slide 32, please, and look at capital.
I would note that, for 2019, we continue to expect FINMA-related model and parameter updates to have an adverse impact of approximately CHF6 billion to CHF7 billion in 2019, of which CHF5.8 billion has been absorbed during the first nine months of the year.The net result was a CET1 ratio of 12.4% at the end of the quarter compared to 12.5% at the end of the second quarter, but I would note that this would have been 12.6% absent the update in capital calculations due to the Eurozone exposure runoff that I mentioned before.Now if we turn to leverage.
Incidentally, that means that our risk density currently stands at 33%, approaching the 35% of which the Swiss capital regime has been calibrated.Now I did just want to provide a follow-up to the announcement that we gave on the 2nd of October regarding our decision to continue to report our financial results on overall basis in Swiss francs but to start calculating our operational risk RWA in US dollars, with effect from the beginning of the fourth quarter.
So before distributing capital to shareholders, that led to a tangible book value per share of CHF16.42.As Tidjane said already, growth in book value is a key financial indicator, and we're pleased with the progress in this over the last year.
Now for the sake of clarity and just in order to focus on the underlying operating performance of the divisions, I will focus the bulk of this discussion on their performance excluding the gains from InvestLab. Now without the gain from InvestLab, the Swiss Universal Bank generated CHF1.3 billion, a reduction of 2% year-on-year, driven by lower net interest income as a result of adverse movements to the Swiss franc curve, primarily in our corporate and institutional client business.I'd also highlight that, in the third quarter of 2018, i.e., last year, we booked a CHF15 million gain from the sale of real estate in this division.
And in particular, SUB's collaboration with Global Markets and IWM, International Trading Solutions or ITS made an increased contribution to the division's revenue performance.Now if you exclude InvestLab, pre-tax income was stable at CHF509 million in the third quarter of 2019.
Operating expenses were down by 2% year-on-year at CHF782 million, with a cost/income ratio of 55% and a return on regulatory capital of 18%, including InvestLab.Turning to net new assets.
And as a consequence, the APAC Markets sub division made a loss of USD34 million in the third quarter of the year.Let me turn now to Slide 38 and IBCM.
Whilst we continue to be extremely disciplined on costs across the division this year, IBCM recorded a pre-tax loss of USD16 million for the quarter compared to a pre-tax gain of USD72 million in the same quarter of last year.As we've previously highlighted, we are encouraged by the progress that's being made in technology and healthcare, and we expect to hold on this as we develop our plans to develop incremental revenue growth over the next few years within the division.Let me conclude then with a few words on the performance of Global Markets.
Global Markets pre-tax income for the first nine months this year now amount to USD914 million, a 150% increase compared year-on-year.As we said already, we've continued to see a strong performance in our ITS collaboration, with higher revenues from increased wealth management activity.
This has been combined with a continued sharp focus on resource management, with operating costs down marginally year-on-year at USD1.1 billion.We've also remained very disciplined with the deployment of capital to the division, with RWA and leverage usage similar to the levels that we saw in the third quarter of 2018.
And once we reach book value, we'll have to reconsider this, but until that point, we intend to continue using it, yes.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerI would also be clear that we do intend to increase the dividend by at least 5% per annum from that base.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. On the negative, we charge, and I'm looking at Thomas here, 75 basis point, but we have not disclosed the proportion by level.
As I said, the impact on net interest income is CHF61 million for the fourth quarter of the year.
I think -- I mean, I think, we talked about it a lot at the Investor Day last December and that we wanted to have a culture in which every year both our business divisions and operating functions generate cost savings.
So, I think the first point is we did see, as we said, continued strong capital generation in the third quarter, up at CHF37.4 billion of CET1, which I think is the most important point.
So you get this slightly, I think, perverse result from the mathematics in which a reduction in risk, because I'm very happy we have redeemed those Eurozone exposures, actually leads to about a CHF6 billion increase in RWA in the third quarter.
And then I think, as you said, Tidjane, even with as our work on ITS is still ongoing, 19% increase in PB transactions in the third quarter.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerYes. So I don't see that as a one-off.
",25.23,0.8893403
creditsuisse,q4,2019,"Made CHF2 billion in the third and more than CHF3 billion in the fourth year, with a return on tangible equity of 9%, which we believe is a creditable performance in the challenging environment for the industry that we experienced last year.But let's look at '19 in more detail, and this is quite important to me.
And I will come back to this, but you know that we have a similar commitment for 2020.So, what I'd like to do at this point is just pause because we're at the end of a period and look back at the strategy we are following at a kind of high level, getting a little bit away from 4Q and the '19 results.
We wanted our capital level to be adequate, that we would operate with a lot of discipline in costs and generating positive operating leverage, that we would reduce our absolute levels of risk and improve our risk management capabilities and also deal with some significant legacy issues, of which the DOJ and the RMBS issue was the biggest back in 2015.So, looking at growth, the first block.
We've told you many times that IBCM contributes a lot of NNA to the private bank, and that's also unique to our model, very significant, depending on the quarter, 40%, 50% of the flows in Asia, but we've gained market share, as we show you here, every year for the last -- no, sorry, for the last four years.
We said that we would first rightsize and derisk the business, but we aim to achieve in the end cost of capital that we've connected to wealth management, but equities in that strategy was key.
And the return on RWA is now at 11%, so double digits.So I will pause here and summarize this first section to say that we have had a continued improvement in performance in 2019, with a particularly strong fourth quarter, but we have continued to deepen a key aspect of the strategy which is the collaboration between wealth management and investment banking and that we believe, having achieved 9% now, that consistent growth and continued disciplined execution will drive us to double-digit RoTE, which is our ambition.And with that, I'll pass to David to continue and take you through the financials.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you very much, Tidjane.
To be helpful with comparisons and to better illustrate our financial performance, you'll see that I've included a table on this slide that includes our results excluding the gains related, first, to the transfer of the InvestLab fund platform to Allfunds Group that we reported in the third quarter which totaled CHF327 million.
If we were to exclude these, net revenues for the year would have been CHF21.7 billion, an increase of 4%, including the benefit from reduced funding costs.Now if we look at our fourth quarter performance, net revenues increased by 29% year-on-year.
If we look at our major business lines, in 2019, wealth management-related revenues increased by 9% compared to 2018, and that's including the gains from InvestLab and from SIX.
And during the fourth quarter, Wealth management-related revenues increased by 23% year-on-year.
Again excluding the gains from InvestLab and SIX, Wealth management revenues would have been up 2% for the year and up 8% in the final quarter.
Our Markets business across GM and APAC continued to see the benefits of the investments that we've made and of the significant restructuring that we concluded at the end of 2018 as well as a more favorable operating environment, with combined revenues increasing by 10% year-on-year in 2019 and by 43% in the fourth quarter, again both stated on a US dollar basis.Turning to expenses.
Our total operating expenses in 2019, including the increased provision for major litigation items that we took in the fourth quarter, stood at CHF17.4 billion, an increase of 1% compared to 2018.
Now, the bulk of the litigation costs sit in the corporate center, as they primarily relate to legacy matters previously recorded in the Strategic Resolution Unit.Overall, we generated a pre-tax income of CHF4.7 billion last year, an increase of 40% compared to 2018.
Excluding InvestLab and SIX, as well as the major litigation provisions, our pre-tax income would have been CHF4.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 18% year-on-year.
For the fourth quarter, our pre-tax income was CHF1.2 billion, up 104% year-on-year, or up 54% excluding these three items.Now, I previously indicated that we'd expected to reduce our effective tax rate from 40.4% in 2018 to between 28% and 30% for 2019, and I'm pleased to announce today that the rate for last year was 27.4%.
We still expect our tax rate to drop to between 26% and 27% for the year, although it may be lower than that in the first quarter of 2020.Now, including the benefits of the reduction in the tax rate in 2019, our net income attributable to shareholders stood at CHF3.4 billion last year, an increase of 69% year-on-year.
Now, just excluding the impact of SIX and the major litigation provisions, we'd have ended the year at 8.2%, and just for reference, I've included a slide in the appendix to show this reconciliation.Let's turn to Slide 39, please, and let's look at the capital base.
We have already begun our 2020 share repurchase program and I would remind you that we intend to buy back at least CHF1 billion worth of shares in 2020, subject to market and economic conditions.Now if we look at risk-weighted assets, these decreased by CHF12 billion to CHF290 billion, of which CHF6 billion was due to foreign exchange moves, specifically from the strengthening of the Swiss franc against the US dollar at the end of the final quarter of the year.
We also saw a CHF7 billion decrease in net business usage in the fourth quarter, reflecting a continued discipline to RWA deployment, particularly in GM and IBCM.
We continue to expect to see an approximately CHF12 billion impact from the implementation of the first phase of the Basel III reforms in the first quarter in January, of 2020, which we expect will reduce our capital ratio by about 50 basis points and increase our risk density on a pro forma basis to 33%, close to 35% level at which the Swiss capital regime, the TBTF2 regime, had been calibrated.Let's turn now to the cost base, please, on Slide 40.
Throughout the year, we continued to fund strategic investments for growth across the bank, particularly in our wealth management related divisions as well as investments intended to improve digitalization efforts and to boost the bank's level of efficiency, but I would also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm that, as we said at our Investor Day, we would expect to have an adjusted operating cost base of between CHF16.1 billion and CHF16.9 billion for 2020, depending on market conditions.
Now, excluding the gains from InvestLab and SIX, the Swiss Universal Bank generated CHF5.6 billion of revenues in 2019.
Net new assets for the year totaled CHF3.4 billion, a growth rate of 2%.
Revenues for the year excluding InvestLab and SIX were CHF5.6 billion, an increase of 3% in the year.
Net revenues, excluding the InvestLab contribution in the third quarter, were up by 3% year-on-year at CHF3.5 billion in 2019.
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, IBCM revenues were down by 8% as a result of lower M&A and corporate bank results, partly offset by better underwriting activity.
RWA and leverage exposure in the fourth quarter were down compared to the end of the third quarter of 2019, including the impact from certain position exits that we executed in the corporate bank.
This performance, strong performance, and the market share gains we've seen were supported by a significantly more favorable environment, particularly in the fourth quarter, after the slow start to the year, but we are pleased to see the progress as we continue to execute against the strategic initiatives of the division.
Thank you.Mark Smart -- Investor RelationsWe will now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference...Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerSorry, sorry.
And we always believe that there was a missed opportunity in terms of entrepreneurs and ultra-high and that we are -- we were uniquely positioned to leverage our investment banking and global market capabilities to drive profit growth and this is why we are quite confident in the future.I will pause here and then effectively, Marc, move to Q&A.Mark Smart -- Investor RelationsWe'll now begin the question-and-answer part of the conference.
So, that's the first question.Second question, I just wanted to pick up on your outlook statement where you talked about strong start to the year and in particular get a view on what you're seeing on the Investment Banking side both in Global Markets and IBCM in terms of activity levels as we're sort of about halfway through the first quarter.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerOkay, thank you, Jeremy.
I don't think about anything particularly planned in the near future, but we obviously do continue to look carefully at our level of real estate usage, particularly in high-cost locations.And the page reference, by the way, Jeremy, would be Page 8 of the media release, which has -- the earnings release, which has the reconciliation because it's -- there's obviously gains in the Swiss Universal Bank and IWM and then there's obviously exit losses in both GM and IBCM.Jeremy Sigee -- Exane BNP Paribas -- AnalystOkay.
And so, yeah, it's the best start of a year we've seen in a while, but you guys have to caveat that with potential discontinuities, etc, but so far, so good.Jeremy Sigee -- Exane BNP Paribas -- AnalystGreat, thank you very muchTidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerOkay, thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Magdalena Stoklosa from Morgan Stanley.
If we look at the Global Markets and the IBCM, of course, we have seen very strong end to a year in one and the strong beginning to the year in both, but when you think about it overall, what's the acceptable range of return on regulatory capital that you show that you would accept going forward for those two businesses?Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerOkay.
And I think it's been, I think, just -- I mean Asia, the wealth management thing, I think, has been -- I think that Number 1 in IBCM is remarkable, but ITS is really very important for how we actually organize our bank.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, absolutely.Andrew Coombs -- Citi -- AnalystWell, thank you very much for your detailed answer and for the past 18 quarters as well.
And I think, we come into 2020 with, as Tidjane and Thomas already said, a very strong start to the year.
So if you actually look at Slide 56, you can see that in the fourth quarter of 2018 we had CHF0.9 billion inflows in APAC, CHF0.5 billion in IWM; and an outflow of minus CHF1.1 billion.
And we want to increase continuously the distribution of the structured lending product to ultra-highs and grow -- we like it because it's kind of annuity-based revenues and income.And more generally, if we go back -- I think Slide 27.
So, generally I think there is an expectation and a need of consolidation but not only in Switzerland, but I think it's true for most European countries.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think, thanks to the good work of Thomas and his team, Antoine and others, we are well positioned in that context because in any case, you want to be the low-cost producer, which is the position we got ourselves into, cost/income ratio of 57%.
For a detailed discussion of our results, we refer you to the Credit Suisse fourth quarter 2019 earnings release and remind you that our 2019 Annual Report and audited financial statements for the year will be published on or around March 25.I will now hand you over to Tidjane, who will run through the numbers.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Mark.
It allows you to be close to your clients, to be nimble, and the logic of this market is so different that it makes sense for us to have Switzerland, for instance, and China in two completely separate divisions while extracting the synergies between both businesses.This is possibly one of the most important slides for us.
I'm speaking too fast -- lower-volatility, less capital-consumptive, more capital-efficient, higher-return businesses is what's driven largely the improvement in profitability that you have seen.So we just -- you've seen this slide before, but really this is -- this integration between advisory, underwriting and financing, sales and trading, global market and private banking is -- yes, if there is a secret sauce, it's the secret sauce for us.
So we're quite convinced that we have a very unique model with a unique capability to implement it well and without taking undue risk, and we think that this will show in the coming quarters and years.Another point I'd like to emphasize is that our investment banking capabilities have not suffered from this focus on wealth management.
And that's exactly what's happened with not only revenue growing, but costs continuing to decrease, very good positive operating leverage and which led to the next slide.This is interesting.
I think this growth demonstrates the resilience of our franchise across all three of our wealth management-related businesses.So, if we look at our other operations, our Investment Banking & Capital Markets activities continued to face significant challenges.
Our adjusted operating cost base, consistent with our usual definition, which excludes major litigation items, was CHF16.9 billion, an increase of approximately CHF0.5 billion compared to 2018.
We have also seen accretion in our book value from net share plan accruals and net credit from our UK and Swiss pension funds as well as an increase in retained earnings following the change relating to the accounting of leases.
As you know, the interest rate environment last year was challenging and our net revenues for SUB including the benefit of real estate gains and higher revenues in the year as a whole from International Trading Solutions, the collaboration between SUB, Global Markets and International Wealth Management.
Operating expenses were down 3% year-on-year at CHF3.2 billion, leading to a cost/income ratio of 57% for 2019.Now turning to Private Clients, our pre-tax income excluding the gain from SIX would have been CHF1.2 billion for 2019, an increase of 16%.
And one reason for that resilient performance was the solid inflows that we saw in our high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth segments.Corporate & Institutional Clients pre-tax income, excluding the gains, would have been CHF1.1 billion for '19, stable year-on-year.
I think this concluded a successful year as a whole, with net new assets totaling CHF32.5 billion.
I would note that expenses for the year included the cost of the increased number of relationship managers that we hired during 2019.Let's turn now to Asia Pacific.
We also had a record fourth quarter in terms of pre-tax income at CHF235 million, largely due to momentum in Wealth Management & Connected, with particular strength in advisory, underwriting and financing.Now, if we look at WMC, net revenues for 2019 were also supported by higher private banking revenues with increased net interest income and higher transaction-based revenues.
If I exclude InvestLab, we made pre-tax income of CHF790 million in WMC for 2019, an increase of 14% compared to 2018.Turning to net new assets, we did see some deposit outflows in the period primarily due to continued pressure on margins.
Net new assets totaled CHF8.7 billion in 2019 and CHF700 million in the fourth quarter.Looking at markets, a significantly stronger finish to the year compared to 2018 as well as higher tangible benefits from the Asia Pacific Trading Solutions venture enabled us to breakeven for this business in 2019 in APAC.
Revenues for the fourth quarter are up by 75% against a weak comparative for 4Q '18, within which equity sales and trading revenues increased by 32%.Let's turn to IBCM, please.
Wealth management-related PTI increased by CHF2 billion.
We said 10% RoTE in 2020, expecting to distribute 50% of these, at least CHF1 billion of share buyback and a sustainable ordinary dividend increasing by at least 5% per annum and you see in our announcement today our position on that.So just to wrap up on this story.
We've always believed in the importance of being strong at home and that has been all the strategy behind developing the Swiss Universal Bank, creating it, setting it up and growing it the way we've had under Thomas's leadership.
I mean we don't expect that to happen, but it's a prudent way to manage the capital position of the bank and protect ourselves from downside, yeah.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerI wouldn't read too much into, Andy.
I think it's an appropriate caveat, and I think we are going to say the same thing last year...Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, we said the same thing...David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerSo, it's just an appropriate caveat.
It's really -- it was there before.Andrew Stimpson -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystBut you wouldn't be halting the buyback if you go above tangible book suddenly.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerI don't -- I mean I think that's -- I think we've said that we intend to buy back at least CHF1 billion of shares this year, subject to market and our conditions.
So, I remain among the people who think that this is going to be managed, but clearly if it lasts a long time, it will have an impact on sentiment and client, consumers, but we have not seen that yet.Andrew Stimpson -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystOkay.
Please ask your question.Jeremy Sigee -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst[Technical Issues] all the clarity you gave on the costs because I was wondering why they haven't flexed down like last year...Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerJeremy, sorry -- Jeremy, we missed the first part.
Those do reduce coming into the new quarter.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerRight.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah, OK.
Is it, would you manage to positive jaws at all times or the absolute cost guidance that you have given us?Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerOkay.
Gottstein -- Chief Executive Officer, Swiss Universal Bank and Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AGYes. I hope you can hear me.
And we think that on average it should be able to hit 14%, 15% return on capital.Magdalena Stoklosa -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystThank you.Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerYes, thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi.
I think the number of banks organized regionally is increasing now.
I think the second question was actually over the...Tidjane Thiam -- Chief Executive OfficerStructured products.
And I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about, within Asia and as well as within Europe, pressure within the private banking compensation levels and fighting for talent and, in that context, breakeven points of new advisors that you hire and how we should think about net expansion of those.And then the second question is to, Tidjane, to your comments about environment that you gave earlier where you indicated wealth management Asia is very strong so far, this year.
",35.88,0.64967346
creditsuisse,q1,2020,"Before we begin, let me remind you of the important cautionary statements on Slides 2 and 3, including in relation to forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial measures and Basel III disclosures.
We would also like to remind you that our Annual General Meeting of shareholders will be taking place next week, on April 30.I will now hand over to our CEO, Thomas Gottstein and CFO, David Mathers, who will run through the numbers.Thomas Gottstein -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Kinner.
And, to further protect our capital base, we have suspended our share back -- buyback program and delayed the decision on the second half of our 2019 dividend until later in the year as previously communicated.Finally, and as you may have seen from our announcement last week, we received regulatory approval to become a majority shareholder in our securities joint venture, Credit Suisse Founder Securities Limited, marking a significant milestone in the Bank's China strategy.Next, let's turn to Slide 6 to look at our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in a little more detail.
Overall, Private Banking net revenues rose 9% and this excludes the gain from InvestLab, showing continued strong momentum in these businesses.Next slide, please.
During periods of market dislocation, as we are currently in, Private Clients are often seeking innovative solutions in order to protect their positions and best-in-class trading execution across all asset classes, including equities, bonds, FX, OTC derivatives and structured products.
As Thomas has mentioned before, Credit Suisse's businesses delivered a resilient first quarter despite the challenging market and operational environment.
Now, these are similar but substantially more conservative than IFRS 9, which was introduced for reporters a year ago and the difference -- there was a number of differences but the most important one relevant today is the CECL includes a provision for losses over the entire life of the loan, which we continuously assess depending on our assessment of the economic outlook, whereas IFRS 9 requires that for only one year under most conditions.So, if we look at the chart on the left, first we're reflecting our allowance for credit losses for our loan book.
Now, this is important because Credit Suisse has a higher proportion of fair value-related assets on its balance sheet than many other banks.
The Swiss Universal Bank saw strong results across all major revenue lines with increased client activity and higher revenues from International Trading Solutions.
Operating expenses in SUB was stable with investments in growth offset by ongoing cost discipline measures.Now, as Thomas has already said, as part of our efforts to support our home market, our clients and our communities, we granted bridging loans worth approximately CHF2.4 billion to support small and medium enterprises as part of the Swiss gain.Now, if we turn to Private Clients, net revenues increased by 8%, with increases across all major revenue categories and exceptionally high levels of client activity.
However, we also recorded net asset outflows of CHF4.2 billion, mostly driven by a single, low margin outflow in the ultra-high net worth segment.Corporate and Institutional Clients, excluding the gain from InvestLab transfer, reported an 8% increase in net revenues year-on-year and that was driven by strong ITS and by strong Investment Banking revenues.
Our International Wealth Management division saw high levels of client activity during the first quarter with resilient asset-based revenues and net interest income, but we did suffer unrealized losses on fund investments within the asset management business.
Net revenues excluding InvestLab were down by 9%.If we look at Private Banking, pre-tax income was down by 7% year-on-year, but that does include the CHF15 million gain from the InvestLab transfer.
Net revenues excluding InvestLab were up by 17% at CHF1 billion in the first quarter and this was largely due to strong results within Private Banking within WM&C, as well as by APAC Markets.
This offset unrealized mark-to-market financing losses on the fair valued lending portfolio in our financing businesses and included in WM&C.So, if you look at WM&C, if we exclude InvestLab, pre-tax income was CHF60 million and that included CHF160 million unrealized mark-to-market moves on our fair valued lending portfolio in the financing businesses and CHF96 million of provisions against credit losses, mainly related to three single cases, the largest of which was caused by a single default on a share-backed loan linked to a Chinese food and beverage company.We saw record Private Banking revenues this quarter as transaction-based revenues increased by 67% year-on-year.
Net new assets totaled CHF3 billion, I think that's a stable performance given market conditions.If we turn to APAC Markets, we saw a strong performance with high level of transaction and gains from hedging.
If we would exclude those, then division would have seen net revenues up by about 4% year-on-year.As I've already said, IBCM's results were adversely affected by negative developments in our Corporate Bank, which is split with Global Markets.
Amid this profound market dislocation and despite significant reserve building, we delivered solid first quarter financial results and saw a good revenue momentum in Private Banking, as well as in our sales and trading businesses.
I actually also included the leverage finance exposure numbers, which I think we did give at the MS conference last last month.
So hopefully that answers those two points, in terms of that component reserve build.I think on the Asset Management point I made before, there's about CHF100 million of impairments, of which around two-thirds relates either to seed money or to joint ventures or partners.
I think it's actually on page 30, that we take net losses of CHF51 million for hedges on uncollateralized corporate derivative exposure.
Excluding the provision for credit losses, mark-to-market losses and gains from the InvestLab transfer, our pre-tax income for the quarter would have been CHF1.9 billion, a 66% increase year-on-year.
Excluding the gains from the transfer but including the over CHF1 billion reserve build, which we will cover later in this presentation, pre-tax income was down 11% on the same quarter of last year.Next slide, please.
Excluding the mark-to-market losses of $459 million incurred in the first quarter, overall, Investment Banking net revenues stood at CHF2.9 billion, up 23% on the same quarter a year ago.Next slide, please.
At CHF1.9 billion, this represents a CHF773 million increase compared to the same quarter of last year and shows that we have further strengthened our combined Private Banking and Investment Banking franchise, our profitability and delivered substantial operating leverage.And with that, I would like to hand over to David for the discussion of our financial results in more detail.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Thomas.
If we were to exclude those gains, net revenues for the quarter would have been CHF5.5 billion and that's an increase of 2% year-on-year.Now, just looking at our business lines.
In the first quarter, Wealth Management-related revenues increased by 7% compared to the same quarter in 2019, again including InvestLab. Wealth Management-related results excluding that gain, suffered from mark-to-market losses, say in Asset Management and in the APAC Financing Group portfolio.
We saw an increase of 9% compared to the prior year, and overall within Private Banking, we saw significant growth in transaction revenues, as well as a resilient result in net interest income and in recurring commissions and fees.If we look at our other operations, our markets businesses across both GM and Asia Pacific, we saw a combined revenue growth of 22% for the quarter, stated in US dollars.
These businesses benefit from a significant increase in market volumes and volatility during the quarter.Our Investment Banking and Capital Markets activities had an initially strong start to the year and we saw a pick-up of momentum and deal closings in January and February.
We saw these provisions across all divisions, but in particular, they were focused on the Corporate Bank, which adversely affected IBCM and GM, as well as our credit exposures in Asia Pacific.I think it's clear that given the deterioration in the operating environment, cost management is going to remain critical this year.
We're going to remain very disciplined on costs for the whole of 2020, with adjusted operating expenses expected to be around the CHF16 billion level.Overall, and notwithstanding the substantial reserve build, we generated pre-tax income of CHF1.2 billion in the quarter and that's an increase of 13% year-on-year.As we've noted, and as Thomas has already referred to, our effective tax rate for the quarter was negative.
And if I look forward to the full-year 2020, given this improvement, I'd reduce our guidance for the 2020 tax rate from the 26% to 27% level that I gave at the Investor Day last December, to be at the lower range of 20% to 25% for the current year.Net income to shareholders stood at CHF1.3 billion and that's an increase of 75% year-on-year, and equated to a return of tangible equity of 13.1% for the first quarter.
Now, already included in this capital ratio, both at the end of last year and at the end of the first quarter, is a full capital reduction for the full-year 2019 dividend, both for the first payment of CHF0.1388 that our shareholders will vote on at the AGM next week, and for the second payment, the Board will review in the autumn and would intend thereafter to propose to an Extraordinary General Meeting at the beginning of the fourth quarter.Now, given market volatility and the overall pressure on the global economy, the Swiss regulator, FINMA, has decided to phase in the CHF12 billion of RWA inflation from the Basel III reforms, primarily related to SA-CCR and certain other measures, which we briefed you on the past, over the whole of 2020.
And clearly, as I've noted already, we also saw a CHF3 billion increase in RWA from the phase-in of the SA-CCR and related Basel III reforms.Our share buyback program is on hold until at least the third quarter of 2020, when we will then reassess our position, and I would hope that will give you a better understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the markets and the economies in which we operate.Just in terms of guidance for the CET1 ratio for the balance of 2020, given the industry and marketwide increases in risk-weighted assets due to the heightened level of volatility and increased lending drawdowns and adverse migrations, together with the phase-in of the SA-CCR measures, I think it's prudent to say that I would expect us to operate at a CET1 ratio of around 11.5% for the balance of this year rather than the 12% that we previously guided.Let's turn now to leverage, please.
The CET1 leverage ratio, excluding net cash held at central banks stood at 4.2% at the end of the first quarter.Now, our leverage ratio increased through the quarter on a like-for-like basis due to the market volatility that we saw and the increases in net cash positions that we held at central banks, but this was then offset by the exclusion of those increased Central Bank deposits, subject to the dividend adjustment as FINMA permits.If you look at the chart, you can see -- that you can see first the impact of the strength in the Swiss franc, which led to a CHF10 billion reduction in leverage.
We then saw a CHF43 billion increase in leverage exposure in certain parts of our businesses in the first quarter, and that was primarily in Global Markets and reflects the market volatility, increased margin requirements that we saw in March, increased sales, drawdowns in the corporate banking book, as well as reduced netting at quarter end.
These increases were then offset by the exclusion of the Central Bank deposits, so that led to an overall reduction in leverage of CHF40 billion.Now, just in terms of the absolute amount of leverage, I would expect the adverse impact on leverage from volatility to largely normalize during the course of 2020.
Clearly, COVID-19 and the move to remote working for some -- much of our workforce does provide the potential to reduce our costs in certain areas, but it will increase in others.Just in terms of guidance, as I said, we're going to be very disciplined for 2020, and I think I'd expect adjusted operating expenses to be at around the CHF16 billion level.Let's turn to tangible book value per share, please.
Now, just recognizing that this should only be a temporary change, without it, our tangible book value per share would have been CHF16.44, an increase of 4% on the quarter.So, let's now turn to our credit provisions, please, and look at the overall reserve build that we took in the first quarter.
Net write-offs and other adjustments, i.e., things we've realized charge-offs generated a reduction of CHF55 billion, and that left our allowance for credit losses on loans amortized cost of CHF1.7 billion, an increase of CHF585 million compared to the previous quarter.Now, if we move to the second chart, we combine the movement of credit provisions with other unrealized credit-related exposures.
Net new assets for Private Banking in the first quarter pretty good, CHF3.7 billion, that's a 4% annualized growth rate.Just turning to Asset Management, excluding the CHF203 million InvestLab gain, as well as the unrealized losses on seed money in the Asset Management funds of CHF101 million, we made a pre-tax income of CHF60 million.
Pre-tax income in the first quarter increased by 21% year-on-year on a 14% increase in revenues, and as Thomas has already said, we saw robust ITS revenues in the first quarter, reflecting higher volatility and continued momentum with Wealth and Institutional Clients.If we look at the main business lines, fixed income revenues were up by 17% year-on-year with higher trading activity in macro and global credit products, offsetting unrealized mark-to-market losses in leveraged finance.
Clearly, GM has also suffered its share of the increase in credit provisions in the Corporate Bank, both specific and CECL linked, which I've already covered.Now, as I mentioned before, RWA and leverage exposure for Global Markets increased due to the significant increase in market volatility in the second half of the quarter.
That's up from $58 billion in the same quarter a year ago.With regard to leverage, we saw a similar step-up due to volatility, increased margin requirements, a high level of fails at the end of March, GM's share of the drawdowns in the corporate banking book, as well as reduced netting.
I think if we looked at the CET1 ratio that we reported for the end of the first quarter of 12.1%, I mean, it was similar to what we guided to back on the 13th of February when we did our end -- year-end numbers, but obviously the components were notably different, because rather than CHF12 billion of SA-CCR and related impact, we only had CHF3 billion and yet you end up with the same number.
The one point I just want to make clear too, Magdalena, is that -- I think I did refer to this middle of last year at some point, which is the capital deductions under the IRB approach for credit losses actually exceeds the the CECL effect.
Over the next, you know, two, three quarters with COVID-19 and the impact of it, the RoTE is going to be challenged, but it's still clearly our goal to be at or above 10%, because that's where we think in a normalized world, the cost of equity is of our business and we want to earn in excess of that.Maybe I will hand over to David for the risk cost, then I will take IB franchise question and then the fourth question around on credit, back to David.David Mathers -- Chief Financial OfficerOkay.
So at the limit and obviously there was a degree of comfort, and what we said on March 18, you'd be talking about a loss between CHF106.2 million to CHF933 million, which I think is CHF129 million.Now so -- if we then look at the various provisions we actually took, you really have got the mark to market move in the leverage finance book, which was CHF284 million that was taken entirely in March.
Obviously the biggest thing was, this transfer of a single, low margin ultra high net worth mandates from Credit Suisse to a different bank, which was the bulk of what you actually saw in SUB, and that was definitely not related in any way to a leverage loan.I think we have seen some deleveraging as you'd expect and face these markets and if you actually look at the components of assets under management, it's up to about 32% cash now across all three of our private banking business.
If CECL losses were to increase by CHF200 million that's some subsequent call it -- some subsequent quarter from the level they are now, than basically we would start see a capital reduction and then we'd be -- then I think that's when the phasing question actually kicks in.
