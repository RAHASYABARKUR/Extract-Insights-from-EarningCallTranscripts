jpmc,q2,2015,"The improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation, along with an overall reduction to risk weighted assets primarily from lower risk across market and counterparty credit as well as some data enhancements with loan growth offsetting run off.
On the previous page you may have seen that HQLA was down $82 billion this quarter, primarily reflecting those lower levels of cash.
Quarter-on-quarter the reduction in cash drove a 4 basis point improvement was partially offset by lower yields and as I said, Firm NII was flat.
Net interest income was flat sequentially with modest spread compression offset by deposit growth and NIR was up 7% seasonally and 2% year-on-year on continued strong client investment and debit revenue.
WeÂve recently signed several new strategic clients, including Chevron, Cinemark, Gap Inc., Marriott and Rite Aid. Together they represent an incremental 5% to our volume and the majority have signed up for ChaseNet. Lastly in Auto, results continue to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales and stable used car values.
This quarter we continued to rank number one in global IB fees with 8.2% wallet share and widening the gap for number two.
Given the reporting changes weÂve made going forward, we should expect that for treasury services revenues would be about $875 million plus or minus per quarter and lending approximately $350 million and thatÂs given the trade finance transfer.
WeÂre fully expecting to see normal seasonal declines in the third quarter markets revenues.
We also saw continued momentum in IB revenue off of a record last quarter which was driven by a large transaction.
C&I loans grew 3% sequentially in line with the industry with middle market growth being somewhat challenged by strong competition, but with more strength in corporate client banking, driven by short-term financing activity and new facilities for our existing client base.
Driven by continued net long term inflows marking the 25th consecutive quarter at $13 billion with strength in North America and multi-asset flows, driving record AUM of $1.8 trillion up 4% year-on-year and client assets of $2.4 trillion.
My first question is the capital progress has clearly been solid this quarter.
So we actually havenÂt really changed our point of view since Investor Day and previously about the fact that we are expecting retail deposit and there are other people who have slightly different views, but we are expecting retail deposit to reprice higher and faster in this cycle than in previous rising rate cycles, given the competition so good high quality LTR compliant retail deposit, given the advancements in mobile banking, given the awareness in the general environment around low rates and the desire to participate in rising rates.
I see your markets revenue are down 1% year-over-year the way you look at this, but IÂm trying to reconcile that with JamieÂs comments two months ago at a New York conference where you said there is repricing in rates, derivatives, prime brokerage clearing and trade finance.
Yes. I mean, I just give you some very specific things and I will tell you why it's hard to figure out exactly what shows up.
In other categories, clients are like deposits we haven't seen repricing effectively.
Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
Marianne mentioned it, but emphasis, Chase Paymentech which youÂre seeing really good growth probably 50% fast in the industry.
I think weÂre doing a great job servicing clients.
Can you give us some color on what youÂre seeing whether itÂs underwriting standards and what kind of product type in the middle market that is most competitive?
But then I look at like total assets in the CIB, its $845 billion this quarter versus $846 billion last year.
Just following up on the markets discussion, curious whether or not youÂve seen some of the drama around Greece impact the M&A discussions in Europe this quarter and maybe an update on the IB Bank backlog at this point?
The M&A we donÂt Greece has expected the M&A dialogue very much, because itÂs been very active pretty much around the world.
And mostly around the world itÂs also like European companies coming to America, American companies going to Europe et cetera and those conversations continue Â
Psychologically maybe itÂs going to affect some people, but I donÂt see why a company that has its own ambitions is going to change them because of Greece.
Marianne gave you all very specific guidelines which you donÂt normally do on treasury services, investor services and expenses in the commercial bank because a lot of you have your models wrong.
Because I got a few questions on whether the deposit betas being a little faster means that the NIM trajectory is likely to be different from last time rates rose for you guys.
Okay, because the last time rates rose your NIM didnÂt move up that much.
The quarterÂs performance was characterized by strong underlying fundamentals across each of our businesses with stable NIM and NII, good growth in fee drive as well as strong IB fees, good expense discipline with adjusted expenses flat quarter-on-quarter at $14.2 billion and an adjusted overhead ratio of 58% and low levels of charge offs and core loans up 12% year-on-year.
Year-to-date our balance sheet is down over $120 billion on a spot basis, driven by a reduction of over $100 billion of non-operating deposits across our wholesale businesses partially offset by continued growth in consumer deposits.
We also saw a $36 billion reduction in trading assets and secured financing as we continue to make progress simplifying our balance sheet.
The performance for the combined consumer businesses was characterized by sequential revenue growth on stronger fee revenue and positive operating leverage, generating $2.5 billion of net income, an ROE of 19% and an overhead ratio of 56%.
Moving to consumer business banking on Page 6, CBB generated net income of $831 million, flat quarter-on-quarter and down 8% year-on-year with an ROE of 28%.
Average deposit balances up 9% or $41 billion year-on-year and weÂre pleased to see that 30% of this growth is driven by our investments in Business Banking and CPC and new builds.
Client investment assets were a record, up 8% to $16 billion and in Business Banking Average loan balances were up 6% with loan originations flat against a record last year and in a highly competitive environment.
Total revenue increased sequentially, primarily driven by higher MSR revenue, but as you can see -- you look at our non-interest revenue itÂs down $500 million year-on-year.
We still expect non-interest revenue to be down about $1 billion for the full-year in line with previous guidance.
Expenses of $1.1 billion were down $200 million or 15% year-on-year and down 9% quarter-on-quarter despite higher volume as we continue to manage down our costs.
On credit, we continue to see improvements in home prices and delinquencies and as a result we released $300 million of NCI reserve this quarter and you can see our charge-off rate were 21 basis points.
Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 3% year-on-year on Card sales volume and Auto loan and lease growth, partially offset by spread compression.
Moving on to markets, revenue of $4.5 billion was down 1% year-on-year, excluding business simplification and the gain in the prior year on the IPO of market which we previously disclosed, but with strong relative performance and rates and in equity markets.
And as I mentioned, equity market had another strong quarter, up 27% year-on-year on revenue of $1.6 billion with strong performance in all three regions relative to last year and outperformance in Asia, particularly China and Hong Kong on the back of client interests first to participate in the rally and later to hedge.
Looking forward, business simplification would drive a 9% decline year-on-year in third-quarter markets revenues with a corresponding decline in expenses.
And as I look into the third quarter in analyst models, I see relative to our markets results this quarter you have revenues in markets going up sequentially.
In commercial Banking the underlying businesses continue to perform well with strong loan growth, up $6 billion quarter-on-quarter and record end of period loan balances with good credit fundamentals and low non-performing loans.
Revenue was flat year-on-year driven by continued spread compression in loans and deposits, partially offset by growth in loans and flat sequentially despite the record investment banking performance in the first quarter.
CRE loans grew 5% and continue to exceed the industry on strong activity in both commercial term lending, which had record originations in the quarter and in real estate banking.
Moving on to Page 11 and Asset Management, net income of $451 million on revenue of $3.2 billion, reflected solid growth up 6% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter.
So to wrap up, strong reported and strong underlying results this quarter across our businesses and an environment that continue to remain somewhat challenging with double-digit core loan growth, with broad-based strength in our underlying drivers, and with continued execution and excellent progress against our capital, our balance sheet and expense commitments.
And I guess the question is in two parts: one, what do you think the chances are of the -- any or all of the CCAR surcharge or the CET1 surcharge to be included in CCAR; and two, what are the next steps in terms of business model adjustments, if that did pass?
Meanwhile, as you know, we are -- and by the way, it happens for us, it happens for everyone and weÂve shown you before not that -- good outcome, but weÂve shown you before that we think that regardless the competitive peers set that we have is going to cluster at or around similar capital levels.
So it's kind of a whole of the amount of things taking place in there, but the goal is to get a proper return to your capital not necessarily to show revenue growth in that line-item.
But the second is we will likely look to potentially push a little farther, but if we get harder and harder, each margin, the next $5 billion or $10 billion, as you get more and more closely aligned operating accounts in operating business and we have always said that we want to do this for the right reason for capital efficiency, but not do it in a way that its going to materially harm our clients.
In terms of revenue impact, not very much right now as you might very well know, because you can see that the balance is much more on a spot basis than on an average basis, but the equation looking forward will be much the same as said at Investor Day, approximately 25 basis points revenue on approximately $100 billion average for half a year, but that would be some expense benefit on FDIC cost etcetera, so not a very big number.
Yes, so let me do this in two parts and I'm going to start with the consumer businesses where the commitment is actually a couple of years old and we are sort of well low on our way to delivering against, the commitment $2 billion in Â17 versus Â14 and its not exactly linear, but you can consider it to flow through time and if you look at the CCB page on whatever page that is, I think we show that for the first half of the year our expenses are down over the first half of last year by $0.5 billion.
So if I have to look at the first half of Â15 versus the first half of Â14, take the 500 in consumer and business simplification in the CIB space, thatÂs probably the right way to size it about a quarter so far this year.
So thatÂs a little better, but obviously on the standardized you have somewhat put pressure as we continue to grow those really great loans that weÂre growing.
We built another modest reserve at this quarter, and we said we donÂt -- we might expect more reserves in the second half of the year, thereÂs another redetermination cycle in the fall and its -- IÂm not going to say likely, but its possible weÂll be selectively downgrading some time.
Your commentary about credit, so the second half is in line, youÂre $4 billion plus and you had a $1 billion of charge offs this quarter again.
Are we getting to a point where youÂre lapping some of these higher reward costs in growth and new accounts, we should start to see that revenue line track more closely with spending or is this something unusual this quarter.
And yes over time as spread compression abates and we continue to drive strong growth with the quality of our products and our partnerships, we would expect that to start too agile.
I just want to point out that trading, if you look at it over a long period of time itÂs been -- weÂve become very consistent.
We know that that the refis have started to come down but the purchase market has been stronger I think than people expected in the second quarter.
And remember if you look at the whole relationship side, I forgot the exact number, but if you look at middle market relationships, I think somewhat like half maybe even a little bit less of the revenues are from the lending.
So you would see, I think Gordon said approximately 150 net down in each of the next couple of years and thatÂs probably still the right way to look at it, but its really perfecting that it worth moving branches to the areas we like, whether the high density of affluence.
Hi, I was just curious about the reduction of the non-operating deposits, and I would have expected that to come mainly out of the Corporate and Investment Bank and -- but when you look at the disclosures on your average asset level itÂs essentially been $850 billion plus/minus each over the last five quarters.
You see securities going down but strong loan growth offsetting and then small reductions in trading and secured financing.
Yes, I think if you go back to last quarter Brennan and take a look at the remarks in last quarter, we talked about the change in presentation of some expenses versus revenues for the ADR business, that drove a reduction but just a classification issue and then in addition we did loose a large client at the end of last year and that is having an impact.
And I think itÂs a mistake not to grow because youÂre going to have tough times.
We expect that and weÂre going to look right through that and the fact that their -- and also the market went from $4 trillion value, so its $10 trillion economy.
Marianne, earlier on you were talking about deposit betas and for a lot of very good reasons, expecting that deposit betas will be a little bit faster this time around.
ThatÂs what weÂre trying to do and itÂs all in that number that we present it and we donÂt think thatÂs changed dramatically.
",44.92,0.7672526
jpmc,q3,2015,"If you exclude tax adjustments, legal expense and net reserve releases, our adjusted performance was $1.32 a share with a 12% return on tangible common equity.
The consumer business had strong performance with loan growth across products driving overall firm-wide core loan of 15%.
And asset management revenues reflected lower market levels, driving weaker client sentiment and transactional revenues.
Also reflected in our results is a net reserve release of $281 million pretax, which reflects a little less than $600 million of consumer reserve releases as favorable credit trends continue, offset by a build of a little over $300 million in wholesale, approximately $160 million of which is additional reserves associated with the oil and gas sector, given expectations that energy prices will remain lower for longer.
We continue to make progress against our capital targets and, as expected, advanced and standardized fully phased in CET1 ratios in line with each other at 11.4% this quarter.
Total deposits are only down $90 billion, reflecting growth in more stable balances, particularly consumer.
The combined consumer businesses generated $2.6 billion of net income and an ROE of 20%.
Underlying business drivers are strong, and based on the 2015 FDIC deposit survey which just came out, we grew our deposits nearly two times the industry growth rate.
CBB generated strong results, with net income of $954 million and an ROE of 32%.
Business banking loan growth remained strong, with average loan balances up 6% year on year and originations up 4% from a strong 2014.
Expenses of $1.1 billion were down 13% year on year despite higher volumes as we continued to manage down our costs.
Expense was $2.2 billion, up 8% year on year driven by higher auto lease depreciation and higher marketing spend.
We grew wallet share by 150 basis points year over year, maintaining our number two ranking.
We maintained our number one ranking, gaining 30 basis points of share.
Treasury services revenue were flat quarter on quarter but down 4% year on year on lower deposit spread, with underlying transaction volumes remaining stable.
Revenue of $4.3 billion was down 6% adjusted for business simplification, with mixed results in fixed income but another strong performance in equities.
Equity markets had another strong quarter with revenues of $1.4 billion, up 9% year on year, driven by reasonably broad strength across products and regions, with good performance in cash, but particular strength in Asia and derivatives.
If markets remain at these levels, fourth quarter revenues will also be lower than previous guidance.
Commercial banking generated net income of $518 million on revenue of $1.6 billion and an ROE of 14%.
Pipelines are trending higher in C&I and remain robust in commercial real estate, our expansion market loan balances are up 20% year on year, calling activity is up substantially across client segments, and we've added around 400 new middle market relationships this year.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect revenues to show normal seasonality from this low base, assuming current market levels.
And AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $3.3 trillion held up well and were relatively flat year on year, with negative markets and outflows driving a 4% sequential decline.
And lastly, we continued to report strong investment performance with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years.
And finally, firm-wide NIM was up 7 basis points quarter on quarter given the mix shift away from cat and securities towards higher loan balances and on an overall smaller balance sheet.
Yes. The most important thing we want you to take away from talking about our co-brand partners is that we feel great about having signed up United Airlines and Southwest Airlines and partnering with them again for the medium term.
I would take a slightly different perspective on the jobs report, the non-firm [ph] payrolls, and not to sort of overthink it, but while I know it was somewhat lower than people were expecting or possibly hoping for, it still at around 140,000 was almost two times what would be required to have stable unemployment.
So the fact that we've got a smaller interest-earning asset base and more loans and less cash and less securities should be supported, even on flat rates.
You noted that you think that net interest income could grow next year even if rates stay low.
So we've taken some modest reserves in the last few quarters and our overall reserve number obviously is consistent with our expectations based upon the outlook for oil prices.
Obviously I'm not saying that there may not be any net incremental reserve build, but we're not expecting them to be significant.
So if energy prices stay around these levels and recover slowly, we're expecting net not to have material incremental reserves in the next quarter.
While we're on the balance sheet, you can see on the call-out on the page that on a spot basis our balance sheet is down $160 billion year to date and an incremental $32 billion this quarter, as we reduced non-operating deposits by over $150 billion, exceeding our commitment.
Originations of $30 billion were up 41% from the prior year and up slightly quarter on quarter as we benefited from a strong pipeline and continued improvement in the purchase market.
We continued to add high-quality loans to our balance sheet, totaling $19 billion this quarter.
We expect non-interest revenue to be down around $250 million year over year in the fourth quarter.
And revenue of $4.8 billion was up 2% year on year, on higher operating lease income in auto, as well as card revenue up slightly, reflecting higher NII on volume, spread and lower interest reversals, offset by the impact of changes to some of our co-brand partnerships.
However, expect the revenue rate for the fourth quarter to be 11.75% plus or minus.
In banking, it was a strong quarter with IB revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% year on year.
Equity underwriting fees were down 35%, generally in line with the market but from a particularly strong prior year.
It was a low quarter in credit with lower volumes as clients were on the sidelines given the challenging market conditions.
Compensation expense was down 13%, with [inaudible] revenue ratio of 30% in the quarter, and non-compensation expense was up 14%, driven by higher legal expense, partially offset as we realized the expense benefits of business simplification.
However, the pipeline for the fourth quarter is solid and we still expect record gross IB revenues this year, exceeding $2 billion.
Loan balances were a record at $162 billion, up 13% year on year and 2% quarter on quarter, driven by continued outperformance in commercial real estate where quarter-on-quarter growth of 4% exceeded the industry across both multifamily and real estate banking.
Loans are the primary driver of nearly $250 million improvement in NII, and given market implied NIM and NII should be relatively flat in the fourth quarter.
First, you'll see we updated our adjusted expense target to $56-1/2 billion plus or minus for the full year, which is better than our previous guidance and would equate to the fourth quarter adjusted expense being relatively flat to the third.
We're expecting core loan growth of 15% plus or minus to continue in the fourth quarter.
Starting with business simplification which will drive a 2% decline year on year, in addition, we expect to see normal season of the clients in the fourth quarter versus the third.
But could we talk about what you're actually seeing in terms of where the financial markets are maybe drawing the line, meaning, are the deals that underwriting you expect to fall off in the fourth quarter based on your pipeline, is that a function of timing that you think could come back next year, are these marginal deals where markets are drawing the line?
My comments about the seasonality in the fourth quarter were most particularly towards markets revenues and less so towards the IB revenue space.
With respect to DCM, our sort of guidance there was that, you know, commentary really to the strength of the fourth quarter last year, and on relative basis, the pipeline is down.
Marianne, can you talk a little bit more about the card business and try to help us understand, the card revenue pressure that we saw this quarter into the fourth, how much of that is the NII side of things and how much of that is kind of the partner repricing, and how far past the fourth quarter do those resets continue before growth can overcome it?
And so it's really the fact that we're seeing that is going to come through in our revenue rate in the fourth quarter, which is going to push it down to below 12%.
I know your prior comments have focused on obviously always needing to invest, but in terms of just your focus as you think about next year and building the expense budget against the environment that we're seeing.
I think I said earlier that, adjusted, the consumer businesses in the three quarters so far are $700 million down year over year in expenses.
So, $700 million, if you adjust for legal expense in the consumer businesses, year to date we'll do some more in the fourth quarter.
I think, Marianne, you said it would be relatively flat in the fourth quarter, yet you're still expecting some pretty strong loan growth.
So with respect to the fourth quarter, we are expecting our loans to grow, and overall net-net sort of rotation of our cash and securities to loans would be supportive of NII.
And I'm just wondering, how should we think about how much is left on the consumer side over the next several quarters, especially given the 23% loan growth that we saw this quarter and your note saying that this momentum should continue?
Is there something going on there that we might see further improvement in the expense space in the mortgage side of the business in the fourth quarter or are we sort of -- are you at where you think you need to be in terms of the $1 billion to $1.1 billion a quarter in that business?
With respect to year over year, I do want to make this clear, with respect to the guidance year over year that we should expect non-interest revenue for the mortgage company in totality, to be down $250 million, that brings our total year-over-year NII [ph] down around $1 billion, maybe a little more, which is what we guided to at Investor Day. And it's more off the back of lower repurchase reserve releases, lower gains on Ginnie Mae sales and [inaudible] against [ph] the, you know, sort of non-fee-based revenues that are to do with third-party UPB, as well as runoff in the UPB.
And the reserve-based lending, you basically take essentially current prices, you discount at a discount rate, you assume expenses, you have to really engineer your cores [ph] and things like that, and you see if you can make -- roll over the loan at a sound, call it 65% LTV, and we think it's pretty good.
So you are right that, at this kind of 2-1/2%, one of these base point levels in card, it does speak to the quality of the loans we're originating and the engagement with the customers, which is much more now about driving, yes, some NII, but really, really good spend and therefore lower credit quality.
",48.98,0.8224996
jpmc,q4,2015,"And in the quarter, we continued our trend of strong balance sheet, capital and expense discipline and exceeded targets.
Shifting to the full year's results, if you skip over Page 2, on Page 3, the firm earned record net income of $24.4 billion and record EPS of $6 a share and a return on tangible common equity of 13.5% on revenue of nearly $97 billion.
With obviously the biggest area of stress in wholesale being oil and gas, against, which we built about $550 million in reserves this year including $124 million this quarter.
And as the outlook for oil has weakened, we would expect to see some additional reserve build in 2016 but prices would need to remain at this level for an extended period for them to be significant.
The increase in NII reflects a mix shift to loans but also includes gains on certain securities and the impact of the rate move in December on this quarter's NII was not significant.
Looking forward to the first quarter, expect firm NII and NIM to be flat to up slightly on higher rates and mix, substantially offset by the absence of those security gains as well as normal seasonal day count.
However, for the full year, with the December rate hike alone so in a rate flat scenario, together with the loan growth that we have seen and expect, we would expect to deliver about $2 billion of incremental NII.
So the task ahead is to solidify this position, which we'll talk more about at Investor Day. But with reference to my earlier comments on redeploying balance sheet, a portion of this reduction will likely reverse in the near future.
The combined consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income on revenue of $11.2 billion and an ROE of 18% for the quarter.
CBB generated strong results for the quarter with net income of $968 million and an ROE of 32% on relatively flat revenue of $4.6 billion.
And excluding an $85 million gain on the sale of a branch, non-interest revenue was down 3% seasonally and up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher service fees and strong debit volume.
Overall net income was $266 million, originations in the quarter were $23 billion, down seasonally and we continued to add high-quality loans to our balance sheet, $16 billion for the quarter and totaling $70 billion for the full year.
For the full year, our non-interest revenue was down relative to 2014 by $1.2 billion brought in line with our guidance and that downward trend will continue.
Expense of $1.2 billion ticked up this quarter related to exiting the OCC's consent order but it was down 10% year-on-year as we continued to manage costs.
The first was a loss in the prior year of over $200 million that related to non-core portfolio exits and a gain we saw this quarter of about $160 million on the IPO of square.
And in terms of core performance, business drivers were strong and growth offset the impact of co-brand renewals on non-interest revenues while driving growth in NII.
Finally, on credit, in auto net charge-offs were 50 basis points and while higher, they were still below our long-term expectations and in card, the net charge-off rate was 242 basis points for the quarter, 251 for the year, and given our underwriting discipline, client selection and the improving economy we expect net charge-offs to stay at these levels in 2016.
With that backdrop, the markets businesses delivered $3.6 billion in revenue in line with our expectations and normal seasonal trends.
With respect to the first quarter, reflecting low levels of client activity we were light risk going into the year-end and inventory was low and so far our trading businesses are performing well.
For the first quarter, expect revenue to be approximately $900 million which includes seasonality.
The Commercial Bank generated net income of $550 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 15%.
We saw record average loan balances of $166 billion, up 14% year-on-year, with growth in Commercial Real Estate of 17% exceeding the industry as we continue to invest in this business and gain share.
Asset Management reported net income of $500 million with a 27% pretax margin and 21% ROE on revenue of $3 billion, down 5% year-on-year driven by lower performance fees in alternatives.
So in summary, a solid quarter and a record for the full year, both in terms of net income and EPS, which even on higher capital translates to a good return on tangible common equity of 13.5%.
So the way we do our reserves, just for context because I think it's important is obviously the oil price outlook is important and instructive and it's very clearly going to drive how we think about probabilities of default and loss given default [for certain] [ph] customers.
Oil, we said last quarter, if oil reached $30 a barrel, here we are and stayed there for call it 18 months, you could expect to see reserve builds of up to $750 million and that assessment hasn't fundamentally changed.
It just seems as though $124 million in additional provisions for oil and gas could be low, at least based on the one year forward prices for oil, which are still in the 30s and so my question's for Jamie.
So just the oil price decline and the decline in the forward curve that we saw towards into December and to the end of the year, that's the impact it had on our reserves.
Marianne, I was wondering if you could remind us where you are on your expense reduction targets in the consumer and the investment bank and how does that translate to some thoughts about the expected trajectory of total firm-wide expenses for this year?
I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about the benefits from rates as they come through, obviously your commentary that NII will be even flattish in the first quarter adjusted for day count and even with some securities gains in the numbers this quarter presumes that a nice helper from that first move.
We are seeing a nice lift associated with the rate hike in December across businesses as well as the continued benefit of the mix towards loans in our balance sheet, but we were flatted in our NII this quarter by $178 million on securities gains in CIO.
And remember, if not nothing in the year that we started the year thinking we would exit $100 billion of non-operating deposits and while there still could be some volatility in that number of course, we've almost doubled that or doubled that in fact.
I hate putting words in your mouth but what do you think the disconnect then is between what's going on in the markets versus what's going on in the trends in your business, both in terms of growth and forward-looking credit books.
So you gave us the -- I think you said $68 million of full year reserve build and you gave us the not significant if things stay where they are.
Although it is clear that net-net despite factors the faith and intention of the committee wasn't necessary to increase market risk capital across the industry, it will be higher but by how much it's really going to need to be sifted through and for that same reason, for both those same reasons, I'm sorry, for the reason that the rule has not been stable and there have been significant questions, many of which have been either addressed or partially addressed many I guess that have not.
And I was just hoping you can give a better sense, Marianne, just given some of your prepared remarks, as to how much of that incremental $50 billion reduction was a function of more proactive mitigation efforts, maybe even tied to the mitigation efforts that you guys had talked about which should presumably remain in the run rate versus balance sheet shrinkage that may be due to the risk loss environment that we're experiencing today.
But the bigger points on the RWA outlook is that we expect to be bound over the medium term by standardized and standardized is going to always have a neutral to upward pressure as we continue to grow these high quality loans.
So but having said that, our buffer has been pretty consistent at the 50 basis point level for a reasonable period of time and we'll update you on all of that at Investor Day. Plus -- well, it is CCAR I should say because as you know the first two quarters of this year, our capital distribution plans have already been approved.
The number at middle market lending, if I remember correctly, if you look at it by client, 60% of the revenues are not loan related.
Revenue was down 1% or $1.3 billion driven by non-core items, most notably by business simplification in the investment bank and also in private equity.
With net loan growth being more than offset by lower market risk, reductions in derivatives, as well as secured financing balances.
Expenses was down 3% year-on-year on lower headcount from branch efficiency and additionally client assets were up 2% and Business Banking average loan balances up 6%.
Total revenue of $1.7 billion increased 8% sequentially on strong loan growth as well as on higher MSR risk management.
While on auto, 2015 set a record for new car sales with strength in the fourth quarter continuing through December and we gained nearly 40 basis points of share year-over-year with the strength of our manufacturing partnerships driving growth.
In Fixed Income, rates markets were up given U.S. and ECB monetary policy actions offset by year-on-year declines in currencies in emerging markets as the strong dollar and emerging markets uncertainty being persisted as well as the commodities on reduced hedging and declines in credit on all those same things plus a number of single name corporate events.
Equities delivered solid results, flat excluding the exit of broker dealer services last year with strong performance in Europe being offset by lower deal flow in North America and Asia compared to a strong prior year.
Security services revenue was $933 million in line with guidance given the continued impact of lower emerging markets on asset based fees.
Revenue was up sequentially but relatively flat year-on-year with NII up 3% on higher loan balances despite spread compression offset by lower IB revenue from a strong quarter last year.
In C&I loans were up 11% largely driven by corporate client banking of on the back of several large transactions.
Finally, credit performance of the portfolio does remain strong with only 4 basis points of net charge-offs.
We saw mixed flows in the fourth quarter resulting in long-term net outflows of $9 billion with solid inflows in equities being more than offset by weakness in fixed income and the loss of select mandates.
We exceeded our targets on expense management, generating positive operating leverage and improving our adjusted overhead ratio by 2 percentage points.
Delivered strong core loan growth of 16%, materially changed the mix of our deposit base including growing retail deposits at 10% and made meaningful progress on our balance sheet, our G-SIB surcharge and capital levels.
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
If banks just completely pull out of markets every time something gets volatile and scary, you'll be sinking companies left and right.
Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Stuart Bernstein.
So considerably more modest, which is why if energy prices and general commodity weakness and stress stays where it is right now, even for an extended period we would think that the incremental reserves would be considerably more modest.
Can you kind of lay out how it's progressed relative to your expectations so far and also remind us how big the allocation of the reserve is against that and I guess not to lead the witness, but is that an area where things are trending early days better than expected and could provide some buffer against maybe anything else that happens on the C&I side?
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Clearly the progress surprise positively, getting down to 3.5%, I was just wondering how you guys are thinking about establishing minimum capital targets.
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
I realize the bond market doesn't set bank loan pricing but just wondering if you've been able to reprice some of the wholesale customers or expect being able to do so.
Bank loan not reprice like the markets do.
I guess I wonder why like we saw pricing in the debt markets come in considerably over the last several years.
And then the follow-up question is obviously the FASB is coming out this quarter with the new loan loss reserve methodology, the current expected credit loss versus what we're using today.
Your last question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
Did that have any -- you guys had very good mortgage banking results.

jpmc,q1,2016,"Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $5.5 billion, EPS of $1.35, and a return on tangible common equity of 12% on $24 billion of revenue; and despite the general market backdrop and energy, our results this quarter were quite good and pretty straightforward.
But we also experienced some charge-offs this quarter in these sectors totaling $48 million, which were already contemplated in the Investor Day guidance of up to $4.75 billion of charge-offs this year.
We told you that the first rate hike together with our strong loan growth would drive 2016 NII higher by $2 billion and the $700 million increase in net interest income year-over-year, that you see here, is in line with that.
Recall that we ended the year with very low levels of inventory and as expected, we did see that reverse with our spot balance sheet up $70 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting growth in deposits and an increase in trading assets and secured financing activity.
In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 4% year-on-year, reflecting that record deposit growth I mentioned, as well as higher account and transaction volumes and investment revenue up 4% despite the challenging environment.
In Banking, IB revenue was $1.2 billion, down 24% year-on-year, driven by lower equity and debt underwriting fees, but in line with the market which was down 27%.
In terms of the outlook, we expect a sequential decline in M&A to be more than offset by an increase in debt and equity underwriting if the recent market improvements continue.
Moving on to Markets, Markets revenue was $5.2 billion and was down 11% year on year, reflecting decent performance given the environment and especially in light of the strength in the first quarter of 2015, where we saw elevated client wallet and trading, particularly in January last year, particularly around the Swiss franc event.
And overall, I would characterize the quarter as seeing reasonably solid client activity, but given the market backdrop, it was more difficult to monetize flows.
And finally, expense of $4.8 billion was down 15% year on year, driven by lower performance-based compensation and lower legal expense, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 32%.
Excluding the impact of the sale of an asset this quarter, which contributed $150 million to the revenue number, adjusted revenue, AUM and client assets were down each generally in line with lower market.
On first read, there are no significant new provisions from the proposal that would change our position, which is that we've been a fiduciary for over 150 years and based on our current advisory business, we are confident in our ability to adjust and be successful.
For Asset Management, the first quarter revenues adjusted for the $150 million were a little over $2.8 billion.
And assuming relatively constructive markets, we would expect those revenues in the second quarter to be flat to up but to be less than $3 billion.
And obviously, expense will also be flat to up in line with those revenues on performance-based compensation.
In the Commercial Bank, we expect revenues will be up modestly on continued loan growth.
The upshot of which is we expect pre-provision net revenue for the Commercial Bank to be relatively in line with the first quarter.
We're expecting close to $100 million, and there were a couple of extra downgrades that came through in the quarter, and that kind of timing is going to happen.
With respect to draws, when I gave some sort of indicative guidance about what you might expect to see potentially in the rest of the year in terms of reserve builds, we do try to take into consideration the likelihood that we will see incremental draws.
And obviously, as we continue to watch the sort of cycle play out over the next several quarters and reevaluate some clients that may be experiencing stress, it's likely that we will see some more NPLs. But I gave you context around what we're expecting to see in terms of reserves, so they will go up, but not to numbers that I would consider to be large in the context of our wholesale portfolio.
And obviously, when we look at growth in CRE or the Commercial Real Estate businesses of 18%, it's an obvious question are you doing something different?
I would start with your opening comments that considering our liquidity you were surprised, this doesn't appear to be a statement about the adequacy obviously of JPMorgan's liquidity, which is very significant, as you know; but it's really about how we analyze and think about that at the material legal entity level and the inter-affiliate nature of how we fund our entity.
So as we think about the implications of this morning's announcement, it's around your planning and procedures as opposed to a likely impact on the business operations today and the results that you can generate.
So on the interest rate point, the comments are pretty consistent with what we said over time, which is we have the belief that the U.S. economy is continuing to move in the right direction, that the consumer is on solid footing and that despite the noise in the data and some of the volatility in the markets, global growth will continue, albeit at a moderate pace.
We are positioned for rising rates, as you know, and have been, but we also understand what the performance of the company looks like if there are no more rate rises or when we stress our portfolios in lots of different ways.
And I would just add that $5 billion plus of sales and trading in a quarter like this I'd look at it as good.
And then with respect to the sort of restructuring and whether that presents opportunities for us broadly defined, including in compensation for better performance, we pay for performance and we pay risk-adjusted returns, and we're not looking to try and make changes to what we've been very consistent about over time.
It's the first real securitization in a long time in a mortgage business where you do revenue risk-sharing, and I think it's quite good.
And just one more follow-up question on the living will, could you help us understand what you think the regulators meant in terms of if the remediation is not met by October 1 of this year that there could be more stringent prudential requirements?
So we talked about the fact that if there's no change in rates and if we continue to grow our loans we'd expect our NII to go up by $2 billion.
I think in our favor because of the easing that's still going on around the rest of the world and the sort of dovish Fed comments there has been a lower re-price just in the industry generally, so that's in our favor but Â and you know we're much more sensitive to the front-ended rate.
But on the positive side Â and on the positive side, Mortgage Banking just given where rates were over the quarter has sort of been positive relative to the central expectations when we did Investor Day. So those two things are worth noting, but we are seeing really quite good drivers in noninterest revenue drivers across the Consumer space generally in debit, investments, in fees and accounts in the sort of 4%-5% range and sometimes in the range higher than that.
So obviously, as you look at their performance for the quarter, our fees have been impacted by lower asset levels, and we also have got the tail impact of some business simplification just getting the tail of that out of their performance.
You've obviously done a fantastic job on the cost base, but one of the issues that strikes me is clearly with the reduced revenues, particularly in the capital markets business, your comp down about $400 million compared to the first quarter or the quarter of last year.
We pay for performance, and I think we did a good job in the first quarter.
Consumers remain on solid footing leading to robust growth in business drivers and strong financial performance.
The wholesale businesses performed in line or better than expectations expressed at Investor Day and delivered decent financial results in challenging markets with significant volatility and global macro uncertainty.
The firm's results included one significant item, $773 million of wholesale credit costs, of which $529 million related to Oil & Gas reserves and $162 million related to Metals & Mining reserves, which were generally in line with our guidance.
While oil prices have improved somewhat in March, they do remain near historically low levels and the market is not expecting the recovery to be strong.
We also monitor for contagion and aside from experiencing a couple of name-specific issues in very closely related companies and observing some general stress in oil regions, we are not seeing anything broad-based and would not expect losses to be significant.
Noninterest revenue was down $1.5 billion year-on-year primarily driven by the market environment in both the Corporate & Investment Bank as well as Asset Management with the biggest drivers being lower IB fees and Fixed Income market's revenue in both case versus a very strong prior year.
Adjusted expense of $13.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year on lower performance-based compensation while continuing to self-fund incremental investments and growth.
Lastly, the Fed did not object to a $1.9 billion increase in our capital plan giving incremental capacity for repurchases next quarter.
CCB generated $2.5 billion of net income and an ROE of 19% with strength across all lines of business.
Mortgage revenue increased 7% on higher MSR risk management and strong loan growth, partially offset by lower servicing revenue.
Expense was down 2% year-on-year with an overhead ratio improving to 55% as we continue to make progress against our commitment, more than offsetting $200 million in incremental marketing and auto lease growth.
Lending revenue was down 31%, primarily reflecting mark-to-market changes on both hedges of accrual loans and securities received from restructuring.
So while investors have started to deploy cash and capital markets are wide open for well-understood names, there is still remaining caution for more challenging issuers.
Credit costs of $459 million were driven by reserve builds for Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining, as discussed earlier.
Revenue was up 4% year on year, driven by higher loan balances and deposit net interest income, offset by lower IB revenues versus a record last year.
Our Commercial Real Estate business continued to exceed the industry with growth of 18% year on year, reflecting superior execution while maintaining credit discipline.
Despite these lower markets, we saw positive long-term flows of $12 billion this quarter with strength in fixed income, multi-asset and alternative and including the benefit of a large mandate being partially offset by outflows in equity products given volatility.
So wrapping up, despite challenging market conditions, we delivered really quite good performance in the quarter with diversification allowing us to perform well in difficult environments and be there for our clients.
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Again, just based on our preliminary read, I think there's going to be significant work to meet the expectations of the regulators and our plan already had us doing a lot of work around actual real simplification of legal entities and other things.
Are there any changes in terms of underwriting metrics that your front line people are seeing since we are starting to see in certain markets like multifamily, which you guys have already identified have some weak spots, are there any other underwriting issues that are cropping up now that you didn't see three months ago or six months ago?
One, do you have any sense of whether your performance overall on really FICC represented market share gains or not this quarter?
But taking a step back, given that the delinquency statistics outside of energy still remain fairly stable, could you give us an outlook for how you think credit quality trends will play out for the rest of the year if the base case is slow growth in the U.S.?
It is absolutely the case that as you look at the resolution process that there are provisions that talk about if a remediation is not satisfactory with or cured within a two-year period, there is a possibility that the regulators could jointly decide and may jointly decide to take other actions that could include capital or liquidity or leverage or operating model discussions.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. If I look at the first quarter net interest income, which was at least better than what I had, good NIM and think about your full-year outlook, if I take it literally, it implies flattish net interest income dollars from here.

Good morning, Marianne, a quick question on NIM here.
Marianne, can you comment on what competitive conditions are like in the credit card market currently and if there has been any change around the intensity of competition for co-brand and rewards?
Your next question comes to line of Paul Miller with FBR.
Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay.
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities.
Maybe just as a follow-up, which is vaguely related, could I just ask, what you talked earlier about where there's a question earlier about competition and picking up market share which indeed you clearly have.

jpmc,q2,2016,"Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $1.55 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on $25.2 billion of revenue, a strong result this quarter, particularly given the backdrop.
And that strength was driven by increased client trading activity across markets and an improvement in IB fees compared to the first quarter, as well as strong core loan growth of 16% reflecting good demand across both consumer and wholesale and record consumer deposit growth, up $54 billion.
Second on Brexit, uncertainty running up to the referendum led to a risk off environment and following the decision, the markets were quite volatile as expected and volumes were materially higher in the immediate aftermath.
With respect to next steps, as you know, the ultimate relationship between the U.K. and the European Union broadly and access to the single market and possible things specifically will likely unfold slowly and over an extended period, depending on when Article 50 is invoked.
For the full year, expect NII to be up more than the $2 billion we guided at Investor Day despite headwinds from a flatter yield curve, given our sensitivity is significantly skewed to the front end of the curve and as industry deposit re-price to-date has remained low coupled with continued strong loan and deposit growth.
Revenue of $11.5 billion included some non-core items, which contributed a little under $200 million, principally a one-time gain on Visa Europe and negative mark-to-market on Square.
Consumer and business banking revenue was up 3%, reflecting strong deposit and account growth.
Mortgage revenue was up 5%, with rates remaining low, supporting production margins and on growth in NII of the added $14 billion of high-quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, partially offset by lower servicing revenue.
Expense was down to 3%, driven by lower legal expense and continued progress against our efficiency commitments allowing us to fund the incremental marketing and auto lease growth that we talked about at Investor Day. Finally, credit trends across the consumer businesses continued to be favorable with charge-offs in card trending up slightly.
So as the mix of our portfolio increasingly reflects these newer vintages, we do expect loss rates to continue to trend up but to do so slowly and as such, we built $250 million of reserve this quarter.
Our credit performance is in line with expectations and we have built $50 million in reserve this quarter, largely reflecting volume growth.
In banking, IB revenue was $1.5 billion, down 15% in a market down 18%, largely driven by lower equity underwriting fees.
We expect to see positive momentum in ECM as the new issuance market continues to improve and we expect DCM to be broadly in line with the first half, reflecting robust high-grade bond issuance offset by lower acquisition finance.
The positive momentum that we saw in March continued into the second quarter with strong performance in rates and currencies in emerging markets on higher client flows and performance also improved in credit and securitized products as client risk appetite recovered in a more stable environment, driving increased primary and secondary market activity.
Equities revenue was $1.6 billion, up 2% compared to a strong second quarter last year.
Revenue was up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII and loan growth and expense of $731 million was up 4% reflecting continued investments in bankers and technology.
Finally, credit performance continues to be in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs of 14 basis points, driven by oil and gas but almost fully reserved and outside of energy, credit performance continued to be strong.
Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 7% year-on-year as we continue to fill the impact of weaker markets, lower performance fees and lower brokerage activity.
We had positive long-term flows of $3 billion as we continue to see strong net inflows in to our fixed income products with equity market weakness and volatility causing clients to derisk resulting in outflows in equity and multi-asset.
To reiterate, our firmwide guidance for the full year on each of revenues, expenses and charge-offs at this point is largely unchanged, obviously market dependent.
I know it's very early and it is probably limited in what you say, because you mentioned, it depends on the timeline of Brexit and how passporting works, but is there any kind of qualitative thoughts you can give us around the operational and/or legal issues we should be watching as this develops, legal entity, restructuring, net impacts of moving people versus lower cost geography, some things like that?
So the ROEs are at or above the portfolio ROEs. And with respect to auto, not to speak for others, but obviously, when you look at lower FICO scores and higher LTVs and longer terms on top of each other in an environment where you have already seen used car prices soften some and they are likely to continue to do so, it's something to watch.
And so we have been very, very thoughtful about that, not just today but as we been going through the cycle and not only on an absolute basis do we compare favorably in terms of LTVs and FICO scores and even terms to the industry but we have been very, very careful and low percentage of subprime originations very, very careful about looking at those layered risks.
So nothing in our -- and remember for this year, I think the charge-off rate is going to be 40-ish basis points compared to a long run average of more like 60.
We added 4% core loans year-over-year in card and so naturally as the portfolio grows over time, you would expect to add to reserves.
And so there will be a little bit of rates impact too but again, as I say, with very accretive ROEs. So I would look forward and expect there to be some reserve adds over the course of the next several quarters on a combination of those factors, but for all the right reasons.
So my first question is, given how well JPMorgan did on the fee car relative to last year's results and it seems like RWA and SLR exposure have stabilized over the past few quarters, how comfortable are you perhaps allocating more balance sheet to the investment bank, given that you seem to be very well positioned to continue to gain market share, especially end markets?
One, on the outlook page, I see on the printed page, it's the same as what you had last quarter for the company overall, obviously, but I heard the emphasis on NII was on the plus side, right, $2 billion year-on-year plus.
It looks like rates will be flat at least in the front end at this point, at least for the majority of the year, if not the whole year.
But you have seen already in the first two quarters that year-over-year we are up $1.4 billion, so we were doing better now on a combination of lower deposit bases, re-prices and also on strong loan growth.
So we would expect our NII to be between $2 billion to $2.5 billion, up year-on-year, largely strong loan growth, lower re-price.
Rates flat from here, so with the tenure of about 1.5 and IOER at 50 basis points, because of the loan growth notwithstanding any long end pressure, we would still expect year-over-year our NII next year to be up between $1 and $1.5 billion.
I wanted to ask a question on the cost side of things where the overhead ratios, both in the CIB and the consumer bank dropped really materially quarter-over-quarter.
I think the most important thing is that we will continue in every single country to serve our clients, day in and day out and if it costs a little bit extra, so be it.
Volatility is reasonably subdued at this point and I think because there are no event calendars out there right now, there is still quite a lot of opportunity in the, sorry, obviously DCM low rates would be a tailwind notwithstanding the M&A in ECM landscape.
It will ultimately honestly depend on the opportunities we see in front of us to continue to invest and to add customers and I think we are at a very good run rate of investments.
So starting with the qualification that obviously as you suggested, it's going to the market dependent, but also remembering that we knew when we gave guidance that we would expect the second half to be seasonally lower.
So you may recall that we said we would expect mortgage revenues to be down year-on-year actually by a reasonably significant amount given obviously where the rate environment is as well as some positive MSR results in the first half of the year, we would expect mortgage revenues to be more like flat.
And I know you can't really discuss too much on the legal side, but is it the right way to think about legal expenses going forward, like an ordinary cost of doing business for a bank of your size?
Marianne, I was wondering just if you could, I know it's a little backward looking now and you have made your points already about what normal trading seasonality could be, but can you help us understand the products that drove the really strong fixed trading?
Look, it's anyone's guess and I think you can go back and look over time, but last year we had a weak second quarter, as I said and we didn't see as much seasonality.
You pointed to, it's going to be at the higher end of the range for the year.
We are seeing the refi nexus go up very high and any outlook on where you think the mortgage market is going to be in the next quarter or two?
Within this, charge-offs of $150 million were principally driven by oil and gas and metals and mining and those charge-offs were very substantially offset by reserve releases, so they were previously reserved which means underlying the net $50 million reserve build we saw incremental reserve actions this quarter of about $200 million principally one energy name downgraded in the CIB.
The market functioned quite well absorbing the volatility and despite significant increases in volumes our systems were stable and we continue to support client activity with decent trading performance.
The improvement in both ratios was driven by net capital generation with RWA remaining relatively flat.
Firm SLR remained flat to the prior quarter at 6.6% as capital generation was offset by balance sheet growth.
Consumer and community banking generated $2.7 billion of net income with an ROE of 20%, reflecting continued strength in business drivers.
We added nearly two million households year-on-year with an increase of 700,000 since last quarter reflecting strong acquisition trends including the launch of Freedom Unlimited.
This quarter that we ranked number two globally and grew share by 50 basis points.
We continued to rank number one globally growing share by 30 basis points and we ranked number one in every product category for the first half of this year.
Credit costs of $235 million were driven by reserve build for oil and gas.
Commercial real estate loans grew 18% reflecting continued outperformance in both commercial term lending and real estate banking and C&I loans were up 9% on increased origination activity in both corporate client banking and middle market.
Comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.
Yes. And these loans are coming on at higher risk adjusted margins.
Yes. So NIM just naturally is down a few basis points.

jpmc,q3,2016,"Starting on page one and taking a look at the quarter, we had strong performance in each of our businesses despite the continuation of reasonably challenging conditions.
Highlights of the quarter include the highest reported revenue for third quarter in the CIB with IB fees up 15% and markets revenues up 33%, with strong performance across the board, robust core loan growth for the Company of 15% on the back of sustained demand across businesses, and the continuation of strong credit performance including a net release for oil and gas.
On the back of continued strong growth in core loans, net interest income was up $700 million and is trending for the full year to be above the $2.5 billion guided last quarter.
Adjusted expense of $14.5 billion was up $500 million, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by two notable expense items in consumer, which IÂll talk about later, as well as the increase in FDIC surcharge which took effect this quarter and some higher marketing expense.
Credit cost of $1.3 billion in the quarter includes consumer reserve build of $225 million, primarily card, but against that we have a net reserve release in wholesale for oil and gas of about $50 million.
And while itÂs primarily driven by mortgage, we also saw 14% growth in auto, 9% in business banking and 7% in card loans.
Mortgage revenue was up 21% on higher MSR risk management but also on higher production margins and growth in NII as we continue to add high quality loans to our portfolio.
Looking forward, assuming strong demand for Sapphire Reserve through the fourth quarter, we would expect revenues for CCSA to be down about $200 million quarter-on-quarter on higher acquisition costs but it will clearly be dependent on the number of new accounts originated.
In cards, we built $200 million of reserve this quarter, reflecting growth in the portfolio including newer vintages which have a higher loss rate than the portfolio average, consistent with our discussion during the second quarter and consistent with how we underwrite the loans.
Total revenues of CIB of $9.5 billion, up 16% year-on-year was the best reported performance for a third quarter and included the highest IB fees on record for third quarter too, up 15% with strong market performance across the board, revenues up 33%.
Coupled with solid credit performance, including a modest reserve build for oil and gas here, the business delivered a pretty clean $2.9 billion of net income and a 17% ROE this quarter.
Revenue of $3 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven primarily by strong banking results on higher loan and deposit spreads.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect net interest income to be up modestly quarter-on-quarter on continued strength in loan growth, even as we digest the incremental cost of resolution based liquidity actions, which will be pulling in our run rate in the fourth quarter.
Finally, expect adjusted expense in the fourth quarter to be flat year-on-year, bringing full year expense in at approximately $56 billion consistent with our guidance and self funding the consumer items I mentioned.
And while as a Company, we are proud of this quarterÂs performance and in particular proud of the growth in the underlying business drivers, we take a long-term disciplined view and remain focused on delivering excellent customer experience, strong execution, particularly in risk management and expenses so that we can continue to deliver best-in-class performance.
So, we may have gained some share, certainly, hopefully the momentum in terms of the business weÂve been building in the way we are serving our clients, will serve us in that capacity, not just this quarter but through time.
So, I donÂt know Glenn if you recall, we had a bit of discussion about this last quarter and sort of guided to the fact that we would expect to see our loss rates go up slowly, I mean partly because obviously 250ish basis points, I think we could call that pretty low historically.
And so, as you look forward for us over the course for the next several quarters and we would expect those phenomena to generally continue again slowly, weÂre growing our portfolio, weÂre going to see the seasoning of those vintages as the mix increases and as they become more seasoned, cause us to build a reserve but for the right reason.
Marianne, just wondering, you mentioned that part of the increase in consumer cost this quarter was planned investments and that youÂre continuing to self fund.
I am just wondering as you think forward and we get past this good gear that youÂve had, will that be kind of underlying expectation for you guys, again with the understanding that the revenue environment will always take things up or down; but do you have an aspiration that you can continue to keep costs flat?
But based upon the speech moving to a baseline minimum standard is more consistent with how we think about our capital management policy and using the capital stack add-up using our G-SIB Score and our stress drawdown, actually you would come out with a sort of capital constraint on the CCAR thatÂs pretty much on top of our regulatory capital minimum.
So, first of all, based upon last yearÂs results for us, we are at the flow for the stress floor for the stress capital buffer, not to suggest by the way that we wouldnÂt continue to want to properly understand and better understand how we can through time make sure that we are performing the best we can on the stress within our risk appetite.
WeÂve built $25 million of reserve this quarter for auto and we expect to continue.
One of the questions weÂve been getting from a lot of folks is because this SEB is calculated based on stress losses year-to-year and historically CCAR results have been pretty volatile, I am wondering how you are thinking about the appropriate management cushion or buffer above the minimum.
Our spot balance sheet closed a little over $2.5 trillion, principally a result of strong deposit growth, as well as liability action taken to raise liquidity in the context of resolution, which also drove up liquid assets.
Card, commerce solutions and auto revenue was down 1% as a strong momentum in card and auto volumes and balance growth was offset by higher card origination cost and the remaining impact of co-brand renegotiations.
Underlying this expense performance is an incremental investment of $250 million in marketing and auto lease growth which is in line with investor day guidance and largely self-funded with expense efficiency.
Rates was a standout in terms of performance this quarter as markets stayed active post Brexit with good client flow, as well as anticipation of an uncertainty around central bank actions.
And credit and securitized products came back from a weak prior period with a recovery in the energy sector and central bank actions motivating clients to put money to work, producing a much more constructive market making and new issuance environment resulting in a particularly strong quarter.
Equities revenue was up 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year with Asia matching last yearÂs strong performance and strength in North America flow derivatives offsetting weakness in cash volume.
Commercial banking reported record net income of $778 million on revenue of $1.9 billion and an ROE of 18%.
CRE loans grew 19%, reflecting strong originations in both commercial term lending and real estate banking.
Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 10 basis points, roughly half of which was driven by oil and gas.
Outside of energy, credit quality is good and the commercial real estate portfolio had no net charge-offs during the quarter.
We saw positive long-term flows of $19 billion with strength in multi assets including the benefit of a large mandate this quarter, as well as inflows and alternatives in fixed income, partially offset by outflows in equity products.
Expect non-interest revenues to be down quarter-on-quarter based upon our current outlook for IB fees and assuming flat year-on-year markets revenues, also including higher card acquisition costs and seasonally lower mortgages.
Just one follow-up if I could get a just a high level comment on has anything materially changed in terms of rate or curve sensitivity as you remix the portfolio and as youÂre getting all this great loan growth?
We obviously did get some good inflows, liquidity flows in terms of money market reform into our government funds but we also have been very focused in our other wholesale businesses on continuing to attract operating deposits.
Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America.
You pointed out that about three quarters of your credit card acquisitions organic growth coming through mobile channels or digital channels I should say.

jpmc,q4,2016,"So starting on page 1, we had a strong end to the year, with record net income for a fourth quarter of $6.7 billion, EPS of $1.71, and return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of $24.3 billion, reflecting strong performance broadly across our businesses in a more constructive environment.
In addition, markets revenue was the highest on record for a fourth quarter, up 24% year-on-year, and credit performance remains, strong with net reserve releases across both consumer and wholesale.
Revenue of $24.3 billion was up $600 million or 2% year-on-year, driven by net interest income on the back of continued strong loan growth, as well as the impact of higher rates.
Adjusted expense for the year came in at $56 billion as expected, and our adjusted overhead ratio improved to 57%, as we continued to execute on and near the end of our strategic cost programs in CCB and CIB, as well as self-funding incremental investments in growth of nearly $1 billion year-on-year.
Another outstanding quarter in commercial banking, with net income of $687 million, record revenue of $2 billion, and an ROE of 16%.
Looking forward to the first quarter, expect net interest income for the Firm to be up modestly, reflecting impact of the December rate hike, as well as continued loan growth.
So I wouldn't call it a deceleration per se, but know it is a little bit lower so I think going into 2017 our expectation is that we would continue to grow loans strongly but possibly at the lower end of that range rather than the higher and of course, to a degree it will depend upon our mortgage portfolio but we intend to continue to add to that too, so sitting here today I'd say more high single 10% plus or minus and we'll give you more updates at Investor Day. Betsy Graseck
I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the forward look NII up a bit but also expenses up a bit and I just wanted to understand is that because you've got the opportunity to reinvest in things that you haven't been able to and if you could just speak to what caned of time frame the reinvestment will yield returns because the question I've gotten from people is why aren't you dropping the NII benefit to the bottom line here.
Volumes, transactions, everything is growing very strongly and although we still have some work to do to finish the large expense programs we're near the end of that, so just generally speaking, we're continuing to invest in the businesses and we'll see the improvement in our expenses flatten out and start to grow with volumes and that would also support growth in non-interest revenue outside obviously as the card phenomenon we talked to you about.
Now obviously we need to continue to that but we are very encouraged by not only the excitement in our customer base but also the way that the trends are performing in terms of spend and engagement, but when we introduce a new product we intentionally introduce a very exciting premium promo and its intended to generate excitement and I think you would agree it did, so we're delighted with the response that we've had and we've actually kept it up for longer than we initially expected but it's normal for us to come down from those intro rates as the product becomes more mature and that's what we are doing but to be very clear about our expectations of the performance of the card even at 100,000 points.
So I think in the conference in November, Kevin Waters said that as we look at the new products and we look at them growing coming out in 2016 and into 2017, we would expect the card revenue rate for the year next year to be about 10.5% after which as the cards and their accounts season and drive revenue growth we should see that continue to trend back up to a level in the past.
I mean, I think that it's actual detail of Retail spend, auto sales, house prices, household formation, confidence numbers, so I'm not basing it on the market just based if you look at a broad range of things that looks like growth may have gotten a little bit better in the fourth quarter plus if you take a walk around the world, Japan is doing a little better, Europe is doing better in fact one of the IMF came out yesterday and both global growth will tic up next year so it's just those factors.
And maybe just if we give you a bit of insight into the philosophy about how we do our investment and expense budgeting when we talk to our businesses, regardless to Jamie's point about necessarily whether the external factors are moving, the question is what do we want to do in terms of products and services and technology and bankers and offices that we can execute on well and responsibly and that is typically what defines us not our appetite to investor dollars, so I think we've told you pretty consistently that and you've seen it we added 130 net new bankers, we opened eight offices in the commercial bank, we're investing in technology very, very broadly, payments, digital across the Company so I would say that we don't feel like we've been held back in terms of our appetite to invest because of concern around the economy and in the same way, a more confident outlook in the economy won't step change that but we will continue to look for great investments everywhere we can and make them.
Obviously your peers and a lot of investors have been growing in their optimism for this you're in terms of animal spirits and everything else and just want to get a sense of how you're thinking about it do you share that optimism and any commentary on how we can think about both banking and trading into the New Year with all of the moving parts that we have around policy, etc.
So I would say just if we separate the two and just talk for one second about banking, you know fundamentals for a solid M&A year are there and obviously there will be puts and takes depending on what happens in the policy and reforms space, but we're optimistic about a solid M&A market but with the continuing trend of fewer mega deals but nevertheless good flow.
So yes, Matt it does include the benefit of higher long en rates and if you get the Q an get our disclosure on net income risk you'll get math that looks similar to that $1.5 billion or more, and then with respect of sensitivity from here, clearly it's not linear, so you can see if we just look at the Third Quarter, the first hundred basis points this is an illustration of $2.8 billion, 200 basis points of 4.5 so as we clip away, 25 basis points a time or $2.8 billion will start to come down and so that's broadly the outlook.
And actually my follow-up question, on the size of the balance sheet you did talk about loan growth of about 10% this year, if you look full year 16 versus 15 the balance sheet or the earning assets only rose 1% so maybe tie that into as you think about duration, the fact that you're sitting on a lot of liquidity and cash and how we should think about both overall growth in the balance sheet and then potentially some more remixing.
Yes, so what you saw happen in 2016 was not only obviously a rotation from securities and deploying deposits into loans but also we took a very large amount of non-operating deposits out of the balance sheet in 2016 so that is having an impact but we would expect to continue to grow our loans to grow our deposits strongly to manage the overall balance sheet through our investment securities portfolio and from here, if everything continues to be as the market implies we should see margin expansion.
Yes, so answer is across the metals and mining and energy, we have a little over $1.5 billion of reserves and there is a normal level of reserves that we will have that would be a large chunk of that and as you saw in 2016, we did take charge-offs of a little less than $300 million, so we will continue to likely see on a name specific basis as people work through their business models that there will be more charge-offs but ultimately if anything stays stable or improves, and of course we have to see that be somewhat sustained and find its way flowing through the financial statements of our clients then as we upgrade them god willing then we will see more reserve releases but it's going to take some time and we'll start to see that think about the large reserves we took.
We took them at the tail end of 15 and into 2016 we'll start to see new financial data from our clients, we'll start to do the borrowing base redeterminations and look at the impact of prices on reserves in the Spring so we'll start getting data this year so we may see more releases but it's going to come through over time.
Yes, I would say that when I talk about the overall core loan growth going down still being strong, it does reflect the fact that we've been seeing very strong outperformance in our growth over the course of the last couple of years particularly in commercial term lending and while we continue to believe there's great opportunities there, they will be lower so we've been printing in the teens pretty consistently and I would say it will be less and maybe more in the high single-digits but we will keep you updated.
Remember we don't run the business next quarter next month, because Assets Under Management are going up and these corporations are going up, fixed income mortgage will go up, need for FX goes up and needs for hedges go up so over time we know there's a cyclical increase and we try to estimate how much is cyclical and there will be a flip side of that and I think you might have gotten to the end of the secular cyclical decline.
I'd tell you compared to the targets that they set we still have a few hundred million dollars to deliver them and Daniel will go through that at the Investor Day. To my mind, that was a product that's done particularly well this quarter but I was wondering looking forward how you see that performing whether it's supported by what's going on in yield curve or whether do you see that supported more by sort of like one off euphoria around election so maybe that might tail off a little bit and then just moving on from that, how do you view the opportunities for growth in your Capital Markets businesses, your CIB versus say your lending businesses.
And Marianne coming back to the investment portfolio, obviously you talked a little bit about the duration.
Just a quick question for you Marianne, in terms of the mortgage in the overall picture, I understand why you're talking about maybe 10% core loan growth rather than 15% more recently, but just within the residential mortgage portfolio, it looks like that slowed in the fourth quarter, third and fourth quarter from a midteens year-over-year rate to a low single-digit quarter-over-quarter rate.
I think there was a little bit of that in the fourth quarter, particularly relating to actively managed product.
Wouldn't that delay some activity for at least a couple quarters for people to kind of see where we are going to end up and see where tax rates are and see what we might get in deregulation that may change perspective on the long term opportunities, so just thought there might be a little pause here.
Highlights for the quarter included core loan growth of 12% with strength across businesses, continued double-digit consumer deposit growth, ending with deposits over $600 billion, and record card sales volume up 14% on continued strong momentum.
Non-interest revenue was flat year-on-year, with strength in markets offset by higher card new account acquisition costs.
Non-interest revenue remained flat year-on-year, reflecting strength in markets and funding card new account acquisitions, as well as lower asset management revenues.
Net capital generation for the quarter were a positive, included a 16 basis point impact of higher rates on investment securities AOCI.
Consumer and business banking revenue was up 4% on strong deposit growth, and mortgage revenue was relatively flat as higher production margins and volumes were offset by lower servicing revenue on lower balances.
Revenue of $3.1 billion was up 1% year-on-year, driven primarily by strong banking results on higher deposit NII and continued loan growth, predominantly offset by prior period asset disposals.

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
I think if you look at again, there's a lot of wood to be chopped and sausage to be made before tax reform gets done and some of these things are brand new and they've never been talked about or done before so you can read a lot of studies obviously for banks to run net interest income so it doesn't directly change how you look at it so for everybody else it affects complete industries differently.

jpmc,q1,2017,"Highlights for the quarter include average core loan growth of 9% year-on-year, reflecting growth trends across products; continued double-digit consumer deposit growth; strong card sales, up 15%; and Merchant volume up 11%.
Adjusted expense of $14.8 billion was up 7% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher compensation on increased revenue and higher auto lease depreciation.
Adjusted for the student lending write-down I just mentioned, credit cost of $1.1 billion will be down approximately $700 million year-on-year as higher charge-offs in card were offset by a wholesale net reserve release this quarter versus a sizeable build in the prior year.
Looking forward sentiment is positive, market remains broadly constructive; and across products, we expect decent deal flow and the pipeline healthy.
We had a decent quarter in equity with revenue up 2% year-on-year in somewhat quiet market broadly with corporate derivatives and prime being brighter spots.
Credit performance remains strong with a net recovery of 2 basis points reflecting continued stability in both our C&I and CRE portfolios, and overall, a net release loan of loss reserves driven by energy.
Revenue of $3.1 billion was up $3.1 billion was up 4% year-on-year driven primarily by higher market levels and strong banking results on higher deposit NII.
This quarter we saw net long-term inflows of $8 billion with strength in fixed income and multi-assets being partially offset by outflows in equity.
Assets under management of $1.8 trillion and overall client assets of $2.5 trillion were both up 10% year-on-year, reflecting higher market levels and net inflows into both liquidity and long-term products.

And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
I think weÂre way away in credit card when you say well thatÂs too big for JPMorgan Chase.
So thatÂs 70 basis points on your $1 trillion of deposits basically gives you about $7 billion worth of incremental revenue.
I can point you to our presentation in May of 2014 where we showed exactly what we expected deposit reprice to look like based upon historical moves.

Your next question comes from Matt OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Starting on page one, we are off to a good start this year with net income of $6.4 billion, EPS of $1.65, and the return on tangible common equity of 13% on revenue of $25.6 billion with the continuing momentum from last year driving strong performance across all of our businesses.
NII reflected the impact of higher rates and continued growth, and NII reflected higher CIB revenues, partially offset by card acquisition cost and lower MSR risk management.
Total assets returned to above $2.5 trillion, reflecting the continuation of strong deposit growth as well as our trading balance is normalizing from very low levels at the end of the year.
Revenue of $11 billion was down modestly; consumer and business banking revenue was up 8% on strong deposit growth and we are starting to see the long-awaited improvement in deposit margins.
Treasury services revenue of $981 million was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher rates and operating deposit growth.
Another excellent quarter in commercial banking, with the 15% ROE, revenue grew 12% year-on-year due to higher deposit, NII and continued loan growth, as well as a strong IB revenue up 34%, making this the third consecutive quarter of IB revenues of over $600 million.
In commercial real estate, we saw sequential growth of 3%, slightly ahead of the industry but below the pace of prior quarters, impacted both by higher rate, as well as a prudent approach to new originations given where we are in the cycle and maintaining discipline on risk adjusted returns.
I guess on the consumer side, in your retail banking area, are you seeing customers increasingly ask for higher rate in their deposit accounts or any activity where they are moving from kind of checking to savings and kind of early signs of pressure on deposit pricing?
And to be completely honest, weÂve been pretty consistent that we would not really have expected there to be much in terms of deposit re-price at absolute levels of rate that are still quite low.
So, I would just start by saying that the charge-off rates weÂre seeing are completely in line with our expectations and guidance that we gave you at Investor Day, both in terms of 2017 being below 3% and over the medium-term between 3 and 3.25.
So, all the reasons that we articulated, a combination of positive credit expansion that took place over the last couple of years and performance of those newer vintages is in line with our expectations and with high risk adjusted margins.
And I would suggest to you that we will defend that share, but the competition is back and healthy and you canÂt expect us to continue to gain share at those kinds of levels, we want to defend it, but itÂs a healthy competitive market right now.
I think weÂre very happy with the performance of the portfolio with the growth rate we are getting and our core card loans were up 9% year-over-year and was getting a lot of NII benefit from that.
I think your implied guidance of 4.5 billion higher than 2016 is now at the 500 million from where you were at the Investor Day. And then, just as a follow-up on that in terms of if we do -- the implied curve I think has about one more rate hike in June, if we were to get another one, realize the dot plot too and another one in September, would that be immaterial increase in that expectation or just incremental or just how do we think about that?
So, actually the impact of [indiscernible] is a bit more than $500 million, more than was at the Investor Day, and a lot of big numbers that are pretty reasonable.
And if we had another rate hike, it would likely be later in the year and ultimately have relatively modest impact on this year but obviously be important going forward.
I mean, we did have 8% growth year-on-year in C&I, weÂre just saying sequentially things are a bit quieter and there are whole bunch of reasons that could be driving that.
And just one quick follow-up just on the deal making side, M&A slowed a little bit, but IÂm assuming itÂs the same point, Jamie just in terms of pipelines and expectations that corporates have about transacting.
We do think once you get to a certain target, usually about 100 basis points of spread, you start to see a little bit more pricing pressure starting to kick-in, just like you were saying Jamie different productsÂ
So, as long as weÂre seeing double-digit kind of sequential annualized and year-over-year growth in deposits, that provides a little bit cover and the sense of what youÂre talking as well.
We may see a little bit more lag, just because weÂre still kind of continuing to get deposit growth?
Remember, you have to be very careful because if rates were higher, people do different things with their money, like CDs and then how they view the stock market, that money -- some of that is actually in this.
And with respect to Investor Day couple of years ago, lots of things have fundamental changed since then, but the ultimate conclusion hasnÂt, which is that we believe that there is significantly more value for our shareholders and as I said before, for the economy with this Company the way it is today than in some other forms.
Obviously there might be a rate impact; I think you talked about expectations quite a bit.
But one thing that seems to be a little bit unusual is that a lot of the commentary across many of the card issuers is for the expectations of losses to be higher in the first half than second half.
Marianne, let me start with the question on the net revenue rate in the card services business.
So, but fundamentally, if you go back, I think to a conference that Kevin Waters spoke at last year sometime in I think September, he said look, weÂre going to see the revenue rate be lower, about 10 and some for the couple of quarters, while we acquire all of these accounts.

jpmc,q2,2017,"Other notable items predominantly net result changes and legal expense were a small net negative this quarter, so underlying adjusted performance was really strong and highlights of the quarter include average core loan growth of 8% year-on-year, reflecting continued growth across products; double-digit consumer deposit growth; strong card sales, up 15%; and Merchant volume up 12%; number one, global IB fees up 10% and we delivered record net income in both Commercial Banking and in Asset & Wealth Management.
With lower fixed income markets, mortgage and card revenue, all as guided being offset by strong fee revenue growth across remaining businesses.
Adjusted expense of $14.4 billion was up a little less than $400 million year-on-year with auto leases being the biggest driver, but also increasing the impact of the FDIC surcharge and broader growth being offset by lower compensation.
Anticipating you may have questions given the recent Gas & Oil prices, I would emphasize that we guided to expect reserve releases given we started the year with $1.5 billion of energy related reserves and with oil prices having found a lower but seemingly stable level we feel appropriately reserved.
You can see in the red circle on the page here that we ended the quarter with binding fully phased in CET 1 12.5% under the standardized approach with the improvement being primarily driven by capital generation offset by net loan growth.
We continue to grow core loans up 9% year-on-year driven by strength in mortgage up 12%, card and business banking were each up 8% and auto loans and leases were also up 8% driven by strong lease performance from our manufacturing partners.
Consumer & Business banking revenue was up 13% on both strong deposit growth and margin expansion.
With NII growth on higher loan balances and higher auto lease income predominantly offset by the continued impact of investments in card new account acquisitions.
Expense of $6.5 billion was up 8% year-on-year on higher auto lease depreciation, higher marketing expense and continued underlying business growth.
Net reserve builds were around $250 million building $350 million in card, $50 million in business banking and 25 million in auto, in part due to loan growth and in part higher loss rates in card.
With a strong market backdrop and supported valuations we saw continued momentum in global issuance especially IPOs. And debt underwriting fees were up 5% from a strong quarter last year driven by the high flow volume of repricing and refinancing activity even with fewer large acquisition financings.
Treasury Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 18% driven by higher rates as well as operating deposit growth.
Fixed income revenue was down 19% with decent performance across products relative to a very strong second quarter last year which was driven by higher levels of volatility and activity broadly, including as a result of Brexit.
Securities services revenue of $982 million was up 8% driven by higher rates and higher asset based fees on higher market levels and remember the second quarter benefits from dividend seasonality.
Revenue grew 15% driven by the deposit NII as the rate environment continues to be favorable and on higher loan balances with spreads remaining steady.
Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year driven primarily by higher market levels but also strong banking results on higher deposit NII.
But I think what this - what this makes me realize acutely is that no good deed ever goes unpunished and chasing our tails re-forecasting the full year NII every three quarters isnÂt as important or every quarter isnÂt as important as keeping our eye on the long term, which is nothing has changed, we are absolutely realizing the benefits we expected in the banking book assets and liabilities, and that means that our long-term projections will be good and the path is a little bit less important.
Yes. Can you just help us understand like how we turn the corner then on card income and your expectations for that going forward?
Yes. So obviously one of the biggest drivers over the last recent while in card revenues has been the extraordinary success we've had in capturing new Chase Sapphire Reserve accounts.
Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.
Moving on to Page 2 and some more details about the quarter, revenues of $26.4 billion was up $1.2 billion or 5% year-on-year with the increase predominantly in net interest income up approximately $900 million reflecting continued loan growth and the impact of higher rates.
Before I move on, I would also like to remind you that the third quarter of 2016 markets revenue was also a record since 2010, in fact it was about a billion dollars more than the average of the previous five years.
Starting with the quarter we guided second quarter NII to be up about $400 million from the third quarter given the rate hike, but you'll see that the NII deposits increased by only $150 million while we did fully realize the expected benefit of higher rate and continued growth, against that we had the one-time $75 million mortgage adjustment as well as lower CIB markets NII.
These effects together with modest downward pressure from lower tenure rate with all other things equal point to a full year number of closer to $4 billion up, while this is in the previous 4.5, but with the potential to be higher if we continue to benefit from tailwinds of lower deposit re-price.
So you will see, we have adjusted the guidance on the page, but it will be market dependent and any near-term forecast is sensitive to a number of factors none of which changes our conviction that we will ultimately deliver $11 billion plus of incremental NII as rates normalize and we are well on our way.
First, we are seeing slightly lower growth than we expected, coming into the year, it is only modestly lower and more importantly, we remain encouraged by the consistency and breadth of client demand across products.
During the quarter that Jamie had made a comment on potential disruptions related to the unwinding of the U.S. balance sheet, and I'm just curious, it's supposed to be slow and deliver, but I'm curious, how you think that impacts liquidity, the yield curve, trading, that participates in and is there anything you can do to protect JPMorgan against those disruptions?
ItÂs not something that we've seen before and so while it is the case that the Fed is communicating clearly and has every intention to make this gradual and predictable things can change and we should be prepared for that, not to say that that would have a particularly significant impact necessarily on JPMorgan, but that that would just be a downside risk, not a probability.
So that would ultimately slow growth not stock price and if we saw a $1.5 trillion come out of the Fed's balance sheet empirical evidence would suggest that we don't see dollar for dollar reduction in deposits.
The one tiny followup Marianne is I just want to make clear that the whole $4 billion versus $4.5 billion and you spelled out what happened in the quarter, it sounded like most of that full year guidance happened in this second quarter, but I just want to clarify that in terms of the second half NII, but do you think it's overly different from where we were a quarter ago?
If you think about a market making business where we can have assets altering of NII hedged by derivatives that ultimately have enough to NIR, we actually think about that in total revenue numbers, so there could be a little noise in there, but no I'm not expecting there to be significant changes.
Understood, okay and then my second question is, it was nice to see the card revenues on the fee side and the revenue capture rate moves towards the way you've been saying, it actually eclipsed the 10.5 you had said for the year already.
So at 10.5% revenue rate right now and with those having adjusted the premium with those originations stabilizing out into the second quarter, we will see ultimately will lap that impact a year from now and will see our revenue rates that are improving from here towards 11.25% that we sort of guided to in the medium term and we expect to get to that point all other things being equal kind of mid next year.
And of course that is one facet, weÂre also seeing significant momentum on the sales front, obviously as a result of those accounts we're growing core loans 8% and so we're having higher NII on those balances.
Hey two questions, one on M&A strategy, there was some discussion that maybe you were interested in acquiring something that's not really the question to comment on that specific rumor, but more in this regulatory environment and the changes that we've had already, do you feel like there is a little more flexibility for your strategic actions or outlook than maybe a year ago?
So just talk about what we've seen so far I think the industry has been really quite disciplined, which is what we would have expected at this early stage of a normalization in terms of the rate cycle.
And I would say with respect to deposit basis and the Fed balance sheet if we are right and we believe will be close to right and that we see the wholesale non-operating deposits flowing out of the system assuming everybody else has reached the same conclusion then it shouldnÂt really materially impact the liquidity position of financial institutions.
Yes, so whether it's because the operational risk will change or whether itÂs because the standardized rules become at least somewhat more risk sensitive there should be changes over time, but I think for the foreseeable future this is what we expect.
I think your loan book now is about $200 billion in commercial banking and can you just talk about some of the initiatives that you've discussed that the middle market the BIB, and how sustainable that is, and whether, how whether you're comfortable with the risk profile of the book you have there because you are growing quickly?
And then I would just say that in terms of how our clients are behaving and how the dialogue is going, whether you look at middle market, you Corporate Banking, M&A itÂs not to say that the possibilities of reform and the impacts that could have isn't a part of the dialogue, but they are fundamentally really just getting on with things and services.
So look, obviously you know the deal with CCAR people which is capacity is not necessarily a commitment to utilize it although we are as we fairly clearly articulated at our Investor Day and as you see in the numbers here, that we are at 12.5% in terms of our CET 1 and we believe we ought to be able to over time operate the company lower than that within the range of 11% to 12.5% albeit that we will take time to do that.
And that we pointed out two areas where it would have taken place, one is mortgages where regulators have held back lending to first-time buyers, immigrants, self-employed, buyer defaults, et cetera and the second is small business, whereas itÂs not existing small businesses, think of the start-up small businesses and that they are having a hard time getting capital maybe at community bank level et cetera.
I would just point you back to the fact that we have some 20 potentially binding constraints right now of which leveraging a variety of forms is part of that, so to the degree that we get the opportunity to recalibrate that, it could have impact on the margin, but we take all of those things into consideration when we think about the direction of travel of the company.
So when we think about the liquidity position of this company weÂre obviously managing not just regulatory requirements but also to what we will ultimate duration of equity and position of our balance sheet to be through the cycles.
Yes so I would, I would start by saying that a lot can change between now and the next cycle of CCAR or the next two cycles of CCAR and so we never did actually say that we necessarily wanted to get below into the range, but operate for the short to medium term within the range, while we let all of the potential changes to the sort of regulatory environment with large play out.
I wouldn't start imagining necessarily how low that goes, I think we would want to operate with sufficiency of capital and liquidity.
Yes and I mean, I would suggest although it's not something we tell you every quarter that we've been pretty forthcoming about showing you the level of our deposits and the split, at least Investor Day now and then between operating and non-operating deposits and as we start to see the impact of the Fed balance sheet unwind in the light, we will Â we will be very forthcoming.

jpmc,q3,2017,"Client investment assets, credit card sales and merchant volumes were all up 13%, and we continue to rank number one in global IDCs. We had record revenue in the commercial bank and delivered record net income and assets under management in assets and wealth management.
Revenue of $26.2 billion was up approximately $700 million or 3% year-on-year driven by net interest income up $1.2 billion, reflecting the impact of higher rates and continued loan growth, partially offset by lower markets revenue.
Treasury services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 15%, and while higher rates are a driver, we are also seeing positive momentum in organic growth in the business globally as our clients are responding favorably to the investments weÂve made in our platform and products.
Before I move on, the fourth quarter environment so far feels consistent with the second and third with no obvious catalysts on the horizon for that to change, but of course change it could, so itÂs worth pointing out that the fourth quarter last year was also a record for a fourth quarter since the crisis and as such, we expect next quarterÂs markets revenues to be lower year-on-year.
Moving to commercial banking on Page 6, another excellent quarter in this business with net income of $881 million with record revenue and an ROE of 17%, and although we recognize that our results are flattered by a benign credit environment, the performance is very strong and broad-based and is driven by the investments weÂve been making in the business, the differentiated path on capabilities we can offer our clients, and our commitment to business discipline.
Revenue grew 15% year-on-year driven by deposit NII and on higher loan balances with overall spreads remaining steady, and while IB revenue was down some year-on-year, we grew 9% sequentially with particular strength in middle market, which is starting to feel like a trend.
Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year driven by higher market levels and by strong banking results on higher deposit NII.
Finally, turning to Page 9 and the outlook, all of NII, expense, charge-off and loan growth remain broadly in line with previous guidance, so to wrap up, this quarter and this year we continued to consistently deliver for our clients, our businesses are performing strongly across the board, maintaining or gaining share.
Could you just describe a little bit if this is just the start of an improvement in transfer pricing that the consumer banking division is benefiting from, and is there a lag that we should expect would continue to drive up this revenue lift over the next several quarters?
Yes, and the reality, Betsy, is that weÂve kind of operated over an extended period now on the presumption that while we happen to know about this breach, there will be others either right now that we donÂt know about or over time, and so we have to be proactive, not reactive, and weÂll obviously look to learn anything we can but we continue to evolve, so that we can use all of the information at our fingertips.
Yes, so look, obviously apart from the rate hike in June, nothing has really happened much since last quarter, and so the landscape is looking pretty similar, and not because thatÂs surprising, so IÂll come back to that in a second, which is to say that thereÂs been very little to no movement in the re-pricing of deposit accounts.
So at some point in time, and that may be a couple, three more rate hikes from now, the dynamics may start to change, and so we havenÂt changed our perspective about what we think the ultimate re-price will look like.
Then in the wholesale space, there is a spectrum as well, so I would start with weÂre firmly on a re-price journey in wholesale, no doubt, and depending on where you are in the spectrum it ranges from the smaller and lower middle market companies, where the re-price is modest but present, to the higher end where itÂs reasonably high.
If you look at the first four rate hikes of the previous normalization cycle, the overall cumulative deposit re-price was pretty much the same as it is now, so we continue to believe that the dynamics that weÂve been talking about over the last several years and that weÂve expected will play out.
I would also say one other thing about where we are right now, is that as you know, as much as youÂre right about the potential demand for the sort of high liquidity value deposits, thereÂs a lot of excess liquidity in the banking system and although loan growth is solid, itÂs solid, so we arenÂt seeing a frenzy, albeit that weÂre very proud of our deposit growth.
WeÂre doing a bit of all of the above, so IÂll start with the comment which you (indiscernible) before but which we still strongly defend, which is that branches still matter, that 75% of our growth in deposits came from customers who have been using our branches, that on average a customer comes into our branches multiple times in the quarter.
Yes, so as we look at the loss rates for this year, theyÂre coming in as we expected at less than 3%, and as we look out to next year, based on what we know today, itÂs still in that 3 to 3.25% range, albeit maybe at the higher end of that range, so itÂs broadly in line with our expectations.
The first is just to repeat the standard, just as a sort of macro matter, weÂre more sensitive to the short end of rates than to the long end of rates, particularly over any short period of time, so intra-quarter volatility in the 10-year, while itÂs not nothing, is unlikely to have a material impact on our run rate.
In terms of the loan growth, I think itÂs completely normal to see some moderation, and youÂre still doing reasonably better than the industry.
Okay, so on the first, I think it is quite important to not look at the average and to kind of decompose it into constituent parts, because weÂve talked before about the fact that we use our balance sheet strategically in the CIB, but loan growth is not really a thing there, and so this quarter we saw no loan growth in CIB, so no big deal, but it means that that 7.5% core growth for the whole portfolio would have been outside of CIB, closer to 9, so start with that.
Tax reform, so fiscal stimulus, the reality right now is although I think everyone, and ourselves included, are hopeful, obviously that tax reform is done for the right reasons and that the economy responds accordingly, at this point itÂs not front and center in the dialog weÂre having with our clients about whether they should or shouldnÂt do a strategic deal or take an action, so I would say it is neither holding up business nor spurring business, but that could change.
Yes, so we are--at this point, we are at that 3% charge-off rate, rising to 3 to 3.25 next year and growing, so you should continue to expect that weÂll be adding to reserves.
But yes, we do expect to hit the 11.25% in the first half of next year, and weÂve reached the inflection point end of the second quarter and into the third quarter where growth is offsetting the impact of the significant upfront investments in Sapphire reserve, so weÂll see revenues grow from here.
Following up, Marianne, on the commercial banking business, youÂve had--youÂve obviously had very good momentum there over the last couple years, and you did talk about credit dynamics and moderation in credit growth, and sort of a normalization back towards industry trends.
Yes, so IÂll just start with credit for a second, because although we absolutely expect at some point that weÂre going to see normalization of credit, we havenÂt seen that yet - I just want to make that clear.
I guess sort of a related question on the commercial banking business thatÂs a little bit of a follow-up as well on tax reform, obviously Congress--or the administration, House Ways and Congress released a blueprint so Congress can now start to flesh out a tax plan, and obviously thereÂs a lot of uncertainty as to the content, the timing - heck, whether it even happens or not.
YouÂve obviously continued to build cash, the securities book has shrunk - it makes sense give the flatter yield curve, but youÂve combined that with the still good deposit trends and the slowing loan growth, and obviously a challenge as you think about protecting them going forward.
Trust me when I tell you that you talk about excess liquidity because of LCR, and we are thinking about more than just LCR, and we do--as I said, while we do maintain a short position and the cost of being short is relatively cheap, we donÂt have the kind of capacity to invest $100 billion-plus in NBS right now, or anything thatÂs meaningful like that to generate higher returns without blowing through our duration targets.
I know you mentioned that loan yields are expected to be tight on competition, and I think (indiscernible), but have you had to go down market at all for loan growth?
Yes, so look, our card spend growth at 13% up year-on-year is still very strong, so when we say moderated, itÂs from very strong to very strong, and it is in part due to the number of new products weÂve had.
Clients are active with demand for credit remaining solid, all in all resulting in 7% growth in net income driven by positive operating leverage as revenue rises and expense remains controlled.
Consumer and business banking revenue was up 15% on higher NII, approximately equally due to margin expansion as well as strong average deposit growth.
Expect CCSA fourth quarter revenue to be relatively flat sequentially as higher net interest income will be offset by the anniversary net impact of Sapphire reserve last year.
Higher auto lease depreciation and continued underlying business growth were partially offset by lower marketing expense.
In general, it feels like the auto market has plateaued at current levels with inventory, incentives, used car prices and SAW all having stabilized over the last few months.
Securities services revenue of $1 billion was up 10% driven by rates and balances, with average deposits up 15% year-on-year as well as by higher asset-based fees on market levels globally.
This quarter, we saw net long term inflows of $21 billion with positive flows across fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives being partially offset by outflows in equity products.
We also saw net liquidity inflows of $5 billion and continued to increase our global market share.
Record AUM of $1.9 trillion and overall client assets of $2.7 trillion were up 10% and 9% respectively year-on-year on higher market levels globally, as well as net inflows.
Our first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck.
At these levels of rates, you are seeing customers start to make choices to move certain of their deposit balances into investment assets.

jpmc,q4,2017,"Similar to the last few quarters, our underlying results were quite strong in the fourth quarter, and highlights included, average core loan growth of 6% year-on-year, bringing us to 8% for the full year; and credit performance continued to be very strong; a good holiday season fueled double-digit growth in Card sales and merchant volumes, each up 13%; our client investment assets were up 17%; we maintained our number one rank in global IBCs and we grew share; and we had record net income and revenue in the Commercial Bank and record revenue and AUM in Asset & Wealth Management.
And our effective tax rate will be approximately 19% this year and 20% over the near term, think through 2020, after which, it should start to gradually increase as certain business credits are phased out over time.
Loan interest revenue was down modestly as growth in Auto as well as Asset & Wealth Management partially made up for lower Market performance.
Noninterest revenue was up $400 million with higher Auto lease income as well as higher fees across the Investment Bank; Asset, Wealth Management; and Consumer, adding $2.6 billion to revenues and more than compensating for headwinds in Home Lending on a smaller market, investments in Card and lower Markets.
All the other ratios as well as tangible book value per share also reflected a combination of $6.7 billion of capital distributions and the $3.6 billion impact of tax reform.
Consumer deposit growth was strong, up 7%, and we believe we are maintaining our sizable lead over the market despite an industry-wide slowdown, given rising rates.
Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 16% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion as well as strong average deposit growth.
Fixed income revenue was down 27% adjusted, principally driven by a tough prior year comparison and low volatility and tight credit spreads which have continued into this quarter.
And debt underwriting fees were up 12% as the market remained receptive to new issuance across high-grade and leveraged finance and refinancing activity was strong.
Client sentiment continues to be strong, supported by corporate tax reform.
For the quarter, we saw long-term net inflows of $30 billion with positive flows across all asset classes on continued strong long-term performance.
Record AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were up 15% and 14%, respectively, year-on-year, reflecting higher market levels globally as well as net inflows.
So to wrap up, the end of 2017 was constructive, characterized by strong equity markets; higher interest rates; good economic data globally; decent client activity; high levels of confidence; and, obviously, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusting for significant items in the year, net income and EPS would have been clear records, driving a healthy 13% return on tangible common equity.
Our first question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
So I think you'll see the capital markets space potentially react more quickly and I think loan growth may have a bit of a lag, but never say never.
Just looked like credit continues to be pretty good.
And then just consumer credit, broadly speaking, Auto has continued to look a little bit better and Card's still within reasonable expectations.
How are you guys just thinking about how the consumer behaves and what that means for both consumer loan growth and consumer credit?
Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.
Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of wells Fargo Security.
Our next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.
Was wondering how you're thinking about the credit environment heading into this year.
Yes. So 2018 feels like very strong credit performance in Consumer.
Or is your balance growth coming more from new customers?
Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Nomura Instinet.
So if you assume that the 2018 structure is much like 2017 with a nice healthy caveat that DTAs, DTLs and the impact of them can be volatile based on the scenario, so with that caveat, I would tell you that not carrying back NOLs has a very particular interplay with foreign tax credits, which means it's not really going to affect us in a meaningful way.
Marianne, assuming the economy in 2018, '19 accelerates due to this tax reform, I think it may imply that we would have higher interest rates and possibly a steeper yield curve.
Yes. I would say tax reform and a stronger growth outlook will solidify the path of rate hikes.
And if you think about something as first order as housing in high tax states, well, people are pretty situated where they live with their families and their jobs and higher income borrowers activity is less price-sensitive.
That's where real-time P2P has opened -- I think our bank has probably now like 30 or 40, it's been eventually.
The $2.4 billion impact of tax reform was largely driven by a deemed repatriation of our unremitted overseas earnings as well as an adjustment to the value of our tax-oriented investments, including affordable housing and energy.
It is true that we operate in competitive and transparent markets, and this means that ultimately, you could expect some of the benefit for the industry will be passed through to our customers over time.
And for certain of our businesses, pricing is not necessarily directly or immediately driven by fluctuations in the cost of capital, think flow markets.
Revenue of $25.5 billion was up $1.1 billion or 5% year-on-year as net interest income was up $1.3 billion, mainly reflecting the impact of higher rates and continued strong loan and deposit growth, partially offset by lower NII in Markets.
Adjusting for the two front-page significant items that we had this year, being tax reform this quarter and the benefit of the WaMu settlement in the second quarter, our net income would've been another record of $26.5 billion with an ROTCE of 13% and EPS of $6.87.
Revenue crossed back over the $100 billion threshold this year which feels good, $104 billion, up 5%, $4.1 billion of which was higher net interest income in line with guidance, benefiting from higher rates and growth, relatively modest deposit repricing, but pressured by lower Market NII.
We continued to grow core loans, up 8% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending, up 13%; and Business Banking, Card and Auto loans and leases were each up 6%.
And Card, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 11% year-on-year on higher Auto lease income, growth in Card loan balances and margins and lower net acquisition costs.
For the full year, Card revenue rate was 10.6%, in line with our guidance, and we still expect to reach 11.25% in the first half of this year.
Expense of $6.7 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher Auto lease depreciation and continued underlying business growth.
The overhead ratio was 55% for the quarter, 56% for the year as the business moved past the impact of investments and started generating positive operating leverage in the second half of '17.
In terms of credit reserve, the net $15 million build this quarter was driven by a $200 million build in Card on growth, offset by releases in Home Lending of $150 million and Auto of $35 million.
However, Fixed Income Markets included the net impact of tax reform on our tax-oriented investments which was approximately $260 million, accounting for 6% of the year-on-year Markets decline.
So in addition, although not in Markets revenues, $130 million of credit cost this quarter was driven by a reserve build related to that same name.
This quarter, IB revenue was $1.6 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by broad strength across capital markets.
In addition to higher rates, we continued to see organic growth within the business as the investments we've made over the past several years have improved our clients' experience across the platform.
Security Services revenues of $1 billion was up 14%, driven by rates and balances, with average deposits up 12% year-on-year, and higher asset-based fees on record AUC, given higher market levels globally.
I was another outstanding quarter for the Commercial Bank, with record net income of $957 million, record revenue of $2.4 billion and an ROE of 18%.
For the quarter, revenue included a benefit of a little over $100 million associated with tax reform and in our Community Development Banking business.
Even without this benefit, revenue would still be a record, up 14% year-on-year, on higher NII from higher rates as well as deposit and loan growth across businesses.
For the full year, we saw record IB revenue of $2.3 billion, up 2%, with particular strength in middle market, which was up over 50%, compensating for a smaller number of large deals.
Revenue was a record $3.4 billion this quarter, driven by higher management fees on growth in AUM as well as higher NII on deposits and loans.
So for guidance, expect the first quarter NII will be down modestly quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a combination of the lower gross ups I mentioned as well as normal day count which offset the benefits of higher rates and growth.
We do know that there will be puts and takes across our businesses, but in general, we would expect that the sort of certainty that people have been waiting for, coupled with the confidence that we know they've had, and the need for people to try and deliver growth to their shareholders, should mean that things that they were going to do become more compelling and they might be willing to do more.
And then half of the impact from the Tax Act in terms of tax equivalent adjustments is going to be felt in NIIs, that's sort of linear and equal, so that's another $150 million.
So -- but my expectation, just given where we are in the absolute level of rates is that on the retail space, we would still see a lot of discipline in the market in 2018.
But ultimately, we haven't changed our expectations that whatever that time line looks like, we're going to get to an overall reprice of above 50%, but we'll have to see.
So I'll just deal with the Card revenue rate real quick because I think we sort of gave a little bit of this in the third quarter, that given the Sapphire Reserve product and given the extraordinary success we had with that in the fourth quarter of 2016, there is an annual travel credit renewal that took place in the fourth quarter, which we already told you, which you would expect to see the revenue rate go down.
And as we lap the acquisition costs and reward costs associated with acquiring all of those Sapphire Reserve customers, and for that matter, our other new products, we're going to see that revenue rate get to the 11.25%, if not in the first quarter, in the first half of next year.
So again, it's nuanced, so what I expect though, the first question generally that we're getting is the impact on the housing market given certain specific changes in the tax code.
So Glenn, because I feel like in 2017, we spent so much time talking about year-over-year declines in comparable periods, it's helpful to, I think, that back -- remember the full performance for 2017 for fixed income and for equities and to markets in total.
And I know you kind of answered that, but so how much of that benefit -- I guess you paid $11 billion in taxes last year and that might have been under $7 billion with the lower rate.
And I do want to just -- like, there are two other things, just after what Jamie said, which is if some of this is competed away over time and get to lower cost of credit and lower cost of borrowing and improved pricing to our customers and allows them to grow their businesses and spend more strongly, there is a feedback loop.
So you, Marianne or Jamie, a year from now, do you think that the tax code or other factors will result in an increase in capital markets activity, increase in corporate lending and increase in CapEx, which we've been waiting for all decade?
I think if we're right about it in improving American competitive growth in the global economy, it will drive just capital markets activity.
Things looked good this quarter, for the full year, it came in line with your kind of $5 billion charge-off outlook.
So the two things that would change is your absolute level of losses would be higher as the tax rate is lower, against -- and so that would be a negative.
One of the businesses that has been doing extraordinarily -- extremely well in terms of growth and profitability momentum is the Commercial Banking business, and I feel like I ask this every quarter, but I guess the question is what you can do for an encore.
And so we've been investing 100 banks in a year for a period of time, opening offices, adding capabilities, focusing on digital, improving the customer experience just like in the rest of our businesses.

jpmc,q1,2018,"Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $8.7 billion, EPS of $2.37, and a return on tangible common equity of 19% on revenue of $28.5 billion, benefiting from broad based strength in performance, but also lower taxes and seasonality.
So, this quarter's performance in context, on a core basis pretax earnings grew 13% year-on-year, benefiting from higher rate, solid growth across other revenue drivers, and continued investments in our businesses.
Included in the results, you see on the page, approximately $500 million of mark-to-market gains on certain investments previously held at cost due the adoption of a new accounting standard.
This impact which was also about $300 million for the quarter, reduced revenues, was split about 50/50 in NII versus NIR, an offset in tax expense.
Non-interest revenue was up $1.6 billion year-on-year and while it includes the mark-to-market gains on the first page, it also includes approximately $400 million of losses on investment securities and legacy private equity investments.
You'll see that our effective tax rate for the quarter ended a little above 18% compared to the 17% guidance we gave, driven by a combination of higher pretax earnings as well as geographical mix.
So, the reduction was driven by higher risk weighted assets reflecting the increased level of market activity, which similarly impacted all other ratios.
Client investment assets were up 13% year-on-year with half of the growth from net new money flows and with record flows this quarter.
And Card, Merchant Services, and Auto revenue was up 18% including higher Auto lease income, but it was driven by Card on lower net acquisition costs, higher loan balances as well as margin expansion.
Recall, last year included a net impact of a little over $200 million related to the student loan portfolio sale.
Equity underwriting fees were down 19% in a market that was also down and versus a strong first quarter last year, which included a number of large deals.
However, as mentioned, this includes the mark-to-market gains we called out on the front page and also includes a reduction of about $150 million reflecting lower tax equivalent adjustments year-on-year.
Treasury Services and Security Services revenue were both $1.1 billion for the quarter and up 14% and 16% respectively, driven by higher rates and balances.
So both, while client sentiment is high in the wake of corporate tax reform and we remain hopeful that this will support higher demand later in the year, we're not seeing that yet and we are maintaining pricing and credit discipline.
And while acknowledging the tailwinds of tax reform and higher rates, the consistent performance of business drivers is translating into topline growth and positive operating leverage with revenues and pretax income both up double-digits year-on-year.
Similarly, mark-to-markets as we talked about after the first quarter performance that's a driver and then as the ongoing sort of growth in the Auto lease income space which is significant.
Outside of that, you look at our underlying drivers across the Board in terms of new accounts and debit trends in Card sales and Asset Management fees as a driver too, so there's obviously a level of market dependency to it, but a bit of the sort of outsized year-on-year increase is seeing the -- somewhat tailwind of Card and market, both in the trading and in the Asset Management base.
Yes, I'll start with year-over-year, we're still getting significant benefits from our investment and expansion markets and also as you know we had a pretty -- we have a pretty unique sort of offering in terms of first term lending and so, for a period of time in both of those bases, we've been materially outperforming the market and so we're still seeing the benefit of that in our year-over-year numbers.
So, quarter-over-quarter what we're seeing is just the impact of the sort of overall industry-wide slowdown and the fact that you're right, it's not just pricing, it's just generally we continue to be very selective and cautious given where we are in the cycle, but we're not expecting flat for the year, we're expecting growth in the mid-single-digits for the year and we still believe that there should be demand.
So, generally across the -- sort of whole industry, I suspect the answer to the question is yes, but remember for us that we haven't been constrained by leverage -- Tier 1 leverage or SLR over the last -- over the last several years.
So, we gave you the stat -- that I think at Investor Day, we see more Card spend both debit and credit, but we also see higher deposits and investment, so digitally active customers.
I think our earnings at risk disclose at the end of last quarter was $1.7 billion, you go forward a quarter and that comes down a little less sort of realized rate benefit, but we've also seen as you know somewhere in the sort of mid 40s basis point increase in rates sort of front and long end which will also have a somewhat significant impact.
So, I would handpick and say of the increase more than half was related to volatility and obviously some of the volatility was somewhat significant, we wouldn't necessarily expect to see that level continue, albeit that we would expect to continue see periods or episodes of significant volatility and a bit less than half to do with positions principally, but not exclusively as a result of higher levels of client activity in the CIB any sort of balance sheet wants to go up and risk weighted assets and so on.
So, my first question to you Marianne is if the Stress Capital Buffer becomes final as proposed and now the industry has a BAU CET1 minimum that could move year-to-year, how does that change your outlook on how to think about dividends and buybacks from here?
Maybe just a question on the TCGA [ph], I know that we're all wondering if it's going to have an impact on loan growth, but what about credit, do you think that that has any positive impact, I guess, particularly on the Corporate side with higher cash flows going forward lower tax rate.
Yes, I would say across the Board actually all the way from full business to middle market, we're expecting sort of higher earnings more free cash and generally speaking, that would improve the sort of credit quality of the portfolio.
So, you're seeing that sort of relative impact of lower tax gross-ups and meaning portfolio and investment securities, if you were to adjust to that, they would have been up in line with rates.
First of all, last quarter was a -- this quarter last year, I'm sorry, was a record and so not that we don't always want to [Indiscernible] I still feel like we did pretty well and it's a little bit like the fixed income story last year, equity market in DCM was up and M&A was less strong in this year that turned around and I would say as we look at the results in ECM and DCM that were down, there were a few -- we were under indexed for the larger fee event for a combination of reasons; some outside of our control and some addressable and also some deals that we had hoped to have closed moved into the second quarter, which is all to say that actually if you look across the Board, M&A still look strong, DCM and ECM pipeline also looks strong.
Thank you operator and good morning everyone.
Adjusted expense of $16 billion was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher compensation expense as well as business growth including Auto lease depreciation.
Consumer charge offs were in line with expectations and guidance and there were no changes to reserves this quarter.
Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth.
Charge offs were driven by Card and were in line with guidance and there were no reserve actions taken this quarter.
IBCs were $1.7 billion, down 10% from a record quarter last year and strong performance in M&A was more than offset by lower debt and equity underwriting fees.
Fixed income market's adjusted revenue was flat versus a strong first quarter last year with rates and spread markets reversing to more normal levels following significant outperformance last year, being offset by strong emerging markets and commodities performance.
A well-diversified story driven by broad strength and continued momentum throughout the quarter with increased volatility benefiting all of equity derivatives.
Security Services also benefited from asset based fee growth on both market levels and new client activity.
Finally, credit performance continues to be very good with zero net charge offs this quarter.

jpmc,q2,2018,"The strength this quarter was broad-based across businesses and highlights include average core loan growth excluding CIB of 7% year-on-year, consumer deposit growth of 5% which we believe continues to outpace the industry; card sales up 11%; and client investment assets and merchant processing volumes, each up 12%.
We maintained our number one rank in Global IB fees and CIB delivered double-digit revenue growth across the board.
Net interest income was up $1.1 billion or 9%, reflecting the impact of higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower market NII.
Net interest revenue was up over $600 million, driven by strong performance in markets and IB fees and also higher auto lease income.
The legal entity loss, together with the rewards liability adjustment in cards are the two notable items I mentioned at the beginning for a total reduction of over $500 million pre-tax.
Client investment assets were up 12% with more than half of the growth from net new money flows and we are capturing an outsized share as our customers shift from deposit to investments.
Consumer and business banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion as well as deposit growth.
And cards merchant services and auto revenue was up 6% driven by lower card acquisition costs, higher card NII on margin expansion as well as loan growth, as well as higher auto lease volumes.
This was largely offset by lower net interchange, driven by a rewards liability adjustment of about $330 million, reflecting strong customer engagement across our Ultimate Rewards offering.
Fixed income markets revenue was up 12% adjusted on the back of good client flow and decent volatility and with commodities making a notable recovery from a challenging prior year.
It was a record second quarter for equities with revenue up 24%, driven by strong client activity and favorable trading results, and with particular strength in cash, prime and flow derivatives.
Treasury services and securities services revenues were each up 12%, driven by higher rates and deposit balances, and security services also benefited from higher asset-based fees on new client activity and higher market levels.
Another strong quarter for this business with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 21%.
Gross IB revenue of $739 million was up 39%, driven by several large transactions and strong underlying flow of business and the overall pipeline is robust and active.
C&I loans were up 3% year-on-year and sequentially due to increased M&A related financing with strengths in our expansion markets as well as in specialized industries, and despite lower tax exempt activity.
Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 7 basis points.
Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 4% year-over-year driven by higher management fees on growth in long-term products as well as strong banking results.
Expense of $2.6 billion was up 6%, driven by continued investment in advisors and technology as well as higher external fees on revenue growth.
For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $4 billion with positive flows across multi assets, equities and alternatives, partly offset by outflows in fixed income.
Although both revenue and expense are trending higher market-related, given weÂre only halfway through the year, weÂre not updating our outlook at this point.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
Consumer deposit up 5% year-on-year, slowing down as we would have expected, while you have seen online competitors and even some regional competitors make some moves in the large bank space, we havenÂt really seen that yet.
This quarter included one-time item, $174 million on the legal entity liquidation.
And our next question comes is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
Our next question is from Matt OÂConnor of Deutsche Bank.
Yes. So, linked quarter, reported down 2 basis points because of lower markets NII and higher market assets, $20 billion; core up 8 basis points.
Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $8.3 billion and EPS of $2.29 on revenue of $28.4 billion, all were record for the second quarter, even exceeding the benefit of tax reform.
Expense of $16 billion was up 8% year-on-year, with half of the increase directly related to incremental revenues, principally compensation in the CIB, transaction expenses and auto lease growth.
Core loans were up 7% year-on-year driven by home lending up 12%, business banking up 6%, card up 4%, and auto loans and leases also up 4%.
As a result, the card revenue rate was 10.4% for the quarter, but our full year guidance of approximately 11.25% holds.
In banking, we maintained our number one ranking for the quarter and year-to-date in Global IB fees and with a record first half performance, and we grew share across the regions.
We ranked number one globally as well as in North America and EMEA and gained share in a competitive environment, driven by IPOs and convertibles in the two most active sectors, healthcare and technology, which are areas of strength for us.
Total revenue was $5.4 billion, up 13% year-on-year or up 16% adjusting for the impact of tax reform and was driven by strong results in equities, solid performance across categories and with performance picking up in the second half of the quarter.
Revenue was a record for second quarter, up 11% year-on-year driven by higher deposit NII and strong investment banking activity.
But, the 11.25% for the year remains true, which is to say that while this may be slightly larger than normal, itÂs not exactly one-time item.
And in the retail also space for example, we talked about commercial real estate for example, mortgage clearly with capacity and the systems for example, all of those areas are pretty competitive for a variety of reasons given where we are in the cycle in the economy and like.
I wanted to ask you what you are seeing this quarter in terms of customer deposit trends, a little more color on both the pricing beta and volume balances.
So, weÂre going to continue to advance -- and itÂs got very high net promoter score by the way.
And so, I would characterize loan growth as solid and our expectations for the outlook to remain solid, benefitting from very active capital markets environment.
And maybe as a follow-up, when we think about NIM going forward, I mean, I think it was a couple of years ago that you talked about maybe normalized being somewhat the 265 to 275 range or 246 now.
But, we are on a core basis -- and remember, we have a fairly sizeable market balance sheet, but on a core basis we are continuing to see NIM expansion in line with expectations and moving up towards that.
And if you look at the proposal that was sent out for comments, not only did it have a large number of questions that they were asking the feedback on but their actual proposal was very similar to what we have been understanding was the intention in speeches that go back a fair way, which is to say that it feels like weÂre still making the sausage rather than this is a done deal.
And just my follow-up question is, the pushback that I am getting from a lot of investors on bank stocks is that we are long in the tooth in the economic cycle.
And I am wondering, both Jamie and Marianne, how you would respond to that pushback that now itÂs not the time to invest in banks because we are late in the game from an economic standpoint?
I think itÂs very easy that rates can go up, the 10-year rates can go up in a healthy environment.
So, while we still feel like that is our outlook at this point, we obviously are going to make the right decisions, based upon the environment that weÂre in.
As we look out for the full year, to the degree that we would be above our -- our outlook is $63 billion, it would be largely driven, if not exclusively driven, by higher performance-related compensation on higher revenues, with the only other caveat that as you probably know, we are waiting as IÂm sure you are for when the FDIC surcharge is taken away.
And if I could just ask a quick follow-up, and I apologize if you addressed it earlier, a lot of multitasking this morning, but on the market side, you did much better than what Daniel suggested in his update in terms of year-on-year being flattish overall.
Marianne, can you share with us, and correct me if IÂm wrong, I think you guys have given us some color in the past about the impact of the fed taking down their balance sheet over the next three to five years by a couple trillion dollars that it will impact your deposit side of the balance sheet.
ItÂs a little bit less credit terms but still pretty robust, albeit that we are seeing a tiny shift to the right in LTVs. WeÂre not going there, by the way, but I would call it pretty modest.
I think, itÂs good for the country, United States that we have a fully competitive field in card, mortgage, retail, asset management, commercial banking, investment banking, sales and trading.
While there were more catalysts this quarter, but you mentioned Italy, I think.
To follow up on the net interest margin, you mentioned ex the markets business it was still increasing.
But for us, the reason why itÂs pretty limited -- not to say thereÂs no other impact, but the reason why itÂll be mostly driven by the areas I mentioned is because in most of our wholesale space and so many of our other products, we are covered for multiple years, if not close to life of loan at this point.
But basically, itÂs still kind of what we expect over time.
",58.35,0.8108974
jpmc,q3,2018,"Record net income for third quarter even excluding the impact of tax reform with key drivers being higher net interest income across businesses reflecting continued rate normalization and solid growth in both loans and deposits, as well as very strong credit performance across all portfolios.
Highlights include, average core loan growth excluding the CIB up 6% year-on-year, card and debit sales as well as client investment assets and merchant processing volumes and consumer were all up double digits.
Noninterest revenue was up $425 million driven by market NII and higher auto lease income, partially offset by markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments.
Home lending revenue was down 16% as higher rates drive loan spread compression and the smaller markets pressuring production margins.
Card, merchant services, and auto revenue was up 10%, driven by higher card NII on margin expansion and loan growth, higher net card fees on lower acquisition costs predominately offset by lower net interchange and also on higher auto lease volumes.
Equity revenue was up 17%, reflecting continued share gains in cash and prime and strong performance in corporate derivatives.
We are particularly proud of the strength and improvement in customer satisfaction broadly and our continued investments which drive leadership positions and market share gains.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Your next question comes from Steve Chubak with Wolfe Research.
Yes. IÂm just wondering, is the yield seeking-behavior youÂve seen so far consistent with your expectation, do you still expect to grow deposits as we look out for the next couple of years?
Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
Could you tell us a little bit more about the dynamics in terms of competition from non-banks, particularly in private middle market lending?
Yes. I wouldnÂt look at any one quarter when IÂm thinking about operating leverage, not to overplay seasonality or anything else.
Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
Yes. But just generically, I wouldnÂt really put tax reform as being a primary reason for what weÂre doing on investments.
Your next question comes from John McDonald with Bernstein.
Your next question comes from Al Alevizakos with HSBC.
Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Your next question comes from Matt OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
So, I donÂt think itÂs a step change, but it does obviously feel particularly when volatility has been reasonably contained outside of specific emerging market kind of areas that everybody is competing for these thin margins.
Your next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Your next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
Net interest income was up $945 million or 7%, reflecting the impact of higher rate, net of lower market NII as well as loan and deposit growth.
Client investment assets were up 14% as we saw clear record net new money flows, more than doubling year-on-year, with flows accounting for more than half of the growth.
Consumer and business banking revenue up 18% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth.
For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was flat to a strong prior year and we outperformed in a market of sound meaningful as we saw robust activity, particularly in ECM.
Treasury services and securities services revenue were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, up 12% and 5% year-on-year respectively, driven by higher rates and balances.
Revenue of $2.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII.
On deposits, while we continue to benefit from the normalizing rate environment, as expected, balances are down year-on-year and bases are trending higher, as we are seeing some migration at the top end to higher yielding investments.
In C&I, demand remains muted in the wake of tax reform as well client confidence is high, balance sheet is strong and liquid, and the environment is competitive.
But if you decompose it, weÂre growing strongly in our expansion markets and specialized industries, growing solidly in our core markets, but are seeing notable offset in tax expense activity, given the mix of our business.
CRE loans were up 3% year-on-year, a little less than the industry as weÂre seeing increased competition and continue to be very selective.
Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees, net of fee compression on higher market levels and continued growth in long-term products.
Expense of $2.6 billion was up 7%, driven by continued investments in advisors and technology, as well as high external fees on revenue growth.
The 10-year is up a modest 35 basis points since then and the world is freaking out that itÂs the end of the cycle and thatÂs going to choke off the recovery.
And B, IÂll ask again, is there a level of rates where you would start to see an impact of slowdown in what youÂre willing to lend rising in credit costs, things like that?
And so, from our vantage point weÂre not seeing anything in terms of looking at our current dialogue or for that matter at credit trends that would suggest that this is problematic.
With higher rates and we do this all the time, we obviously look at all of our portfolio and stress them for shocks of up 100 basis points even up 200, although clearly where we are now, risks are more asymmetric but -- I mean more symmetric.
And itÂs really just our effort to understand the long-term strategy, given that the pricing is quite competitive but at the same time, the marketing effort has been fairly minimal so far?
But, I wanted to understand how youÂre thinking about the impact on the outlook for your asset yields, in particular the securities portfolio.
But, largely speaking, for every rate hike weÂve been seeing on the front end, weÂre seeing our assets reprice about half of that and that -- or loans be priced about half of that and thatÂs what weÂd expect.
And IÂm wondering, given your fairly strong results across the board, where is the market wrong in terms of how theyÂre thinking about either the economy or bank revenues related to a strong economy?
Everything, given that growth outlook, is really sort of lining up for December rate hike and sort of more hikes into 2019 and the continuation hopefully of a steeper yield curve, and that all should be constructive for bank stocks.
It is definitely the case that as weÂve been talking about the years now, as the Fed is shrinking its balance sheet and liquidity is coming out of the system, yes, we are seeing deposit growth slow.
As we think about your wholesale loan trends year-over-year which continues to outpace the banking industry.
So, Marianne, look, I mean ROTCE of 17%, you seem to have some deposit market share gained, but year-over-year for the third quarter, expenses are up more than revenues.
So, expense number and investments, our expenses are up over a $1 billion year-on-year, in line outside of FDIC and revenue related costs, in line with the guidance we gave at the Investor Day. So, think about that sort of $2.7 billion of year-over-year investments, and weÂre working through it.
How do you -- but you guys still have a loan to deposit ratio thatÂs in sort of the mid-60s and youÂve been gaining share on the retail side.
So, thereÂs a lot of different investments and things to play which might make this kind of normalization cycle look a little different.
And so, the way we think about it is we look carefully across the spectrum of deposits, retail and wholesale at what we are seeing in terms of flows and balances and elasticity for our customers on our balance sheet.
But, weÂre going to carry on investing in technology, adding bankers, opening branches, launching new products so that weÂre defending the long-term growth and profitability of the Company.
And in the absence of giving you guidance, I would just point you to the fact that weÂre still targeting -- not targeting, but weÂre still expecting an overhead ratio to be around about the mid-50s over the medium term, which on revenue growth, implies weÂll continue to invest and there is also volume-related costs associated with that.
So, mortgage being a cyclical business as it is, we are, on higher rates, expecting the overall market to be down about 10% year-on-year.
So, IÂd say, on the margin point, itÂs been the case that for particularly in the sort of more liquid space, youÂve seen margins coming down consistently over the years.
So, when you run the business, you run the business to capture your share of that doubling, and of course, margins over time will come down, and the way you do it is being transformed by electronics, et cetera, but itÂs a pretty good future outlook.
So, as you know, weÂve been talking for a couple of years now about the fact that we did some targeted credit expansion in the card space a few years back.
My comment about the performance though is if we had looked at the 2018 card loss rate as we did at the beginning of the year, we said we would have expected it to be closer to 3.25%, but there are three things driving it to be slightly better.
So, a combination of factors have allowed us to deliver, apples to apples, a charge-off rate for the portfolio thatÂs a little better than we would have expected coming into the year.
And obviously, in this portfolio, as we go through the cycle, we would expect charge-off rates to continue to rise.
WeÂre very careful about how we think about residual risks and reserving on that portfolio, but itÂs very high quality growth.
So, obviously, we have a view of what we think the right return profile for these businesses should look like.
So, I donÂt know whether itÂs going to be high single digit or mid single digit growth year-on-year.
At this point, as we look forward over the near term, it feels like that kind of steady growth GDP plus, GDP is what weÂre going to get.
I will say one thing about markets, just to give you guys a tiny view, which I know you now, but just because of tax reform and another one-off item in the fourth quarter, flat year-on-year comparably would be up.
And that will be driven mainly by balance sheet growth, mix, and long end of rates.
",61.29,0.72920626
jpmc,q4,2018,"The increase is related to investments weÂre making in technology, marketing, real estate and front office, as well as revenue-related costs including growth in Auto.
Revenue of $111.5 billion is also record and was up nearly $7 billion or 7% year-on-year, $4.3 billion of which was higher net interest income on higher rates with growth and Card margin expansion being offset by lower markets NII.
At the end of the year, the adjusted expense was $63.3 billion, up 6%, which brings our overhead ratio to 57% for the year even as we continue to make very significant investments across the franchise.
For the quarter, core loans were up 5% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending up 8%, Card up 6% and Business Banking up 5%.
Card revenue rate was 11.6% for the quarter and 11.27% for the year as expected.
We ranked Number 1 for the year and the quarter and saw our leadership positions across all products globally with particular strength in IPOs as well as in the technology and healthcare sectors.
Revenue of $3.4 billion for the quarter was down 5% year-on-year with the impact of current market levels driving lower investment valuations and management fees as well as to a lesser extent, lower performance fees.
Expense of $2.6 billion was flat, as continued investments in advisors and in technology were offset by lower performance-based compensation and lower revenue-driven external fees.
For the quarter, we saw net long-term outflows of $3 billion with strength in fixed income more than offset by outflows from equity and multi-asset products.
Net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates and growth but quarter-over-quarter will be negatively impacted by day count.
So, to close, while the markets in the fourth quarter were more challenging, we should not lose sight to the fact that 2018 was a strong year, indeed a record for revenues, net income and EPS, both reported and adjusted for tax reform.
So, the way bank stocks have performed, clearly, investors are starting to worry about revenue trends near-term and of course credit, which you addressed.
IÂm wondering if the revenue trends continue to be weaker than expected, if the overhead ratio of 57% that you posted in Â17 and Â18 is something that you could continue to level off to, or will the investment horizon be more of a dominant factor when weÂre thinking about the overhead ratio.
But that said, we have -- while we donÂt set expense target, nor do we set overhead ratio targets, we have given you some outlook that would suggest that we continue to believe that combination of revenue growth and expense discipline, notwithstanding the investments that weÂve been making, we should see our overhead ratio continue to be stable to trending down to the kind of mid-50, so 55ish%.
And just as a follow-up question, the market is also thinking that the last rate hike from the Fed was December, and I'm wondering how we should think about the dynamics of net interest income and more specifically net interest margin and deposit pricing if December was indeed the last rate hike for some time.
So, if it is a pause because you are going to recession, youÂre going to do trades that obviously is very different than itÂs to pause, economy is strong and they raise rates, you know which one you would choose.
But over the course of the last couple of years as we've experienced that performance, we've done sort of surgical risk pullbacks, and we amended our collection strategy, all of which have led to a charge-off rate for the fourth quarter in Â18 that's down slightly year-on-year and for the year that's a 310 basis points which is reasonably meaningfully below our expectations, even as late as the end of last year.
So, we feel great that that kind of loss trends at that 310, maybe a little bit higher is something we should look forward to at least into 2019.
Just wondering on the markets commentary, obviously super early in the quarter, but you mentioned things feeling better.
And then, also in the fourth quarter, what you saw in leverage lending market, how much do you have to take in terms of maybe marks and leveraged loans and the hung deals?
So, I would say that obviously the fourth quarter was challenging and there was a lot of market moves, a big sort of broad set of.
And at that point, there were elevated concerns around trade, global growth data was causing concerns, there were concerns that the Fed was going to continue to be hawkish and not necessarily as responsive to some of the things the market was worried about.
So, yes, we could see slower growth but still growth in the U.S. and across the globe, a slightly more constructive narrative on trade and that continues to broadly progress we hope and believe in a positive direction, and a more dovish outlook from the Fed that potential for that to be pauses in rates or being relatively supportive.
ThatÂs not to say that there's no deal that has the potential for there to be net losses after fee, but nothing that we would consider to be significant and nothing in the fourth quarter.
I would also say that coming back to the first quarter that actually the market could be quite constructive to fixed income into the third quarter, given a more dovish Fed supporting corporate margin, corporate default rates are going to stay pretty low and we do have time.
So, itÂs no good of a conserve talking about how we think things are going to pan out in time in the first quarter other than just the general comment IÂve already made, which is the environment should be more constructive and weÂre expecting decent volatility in client activity and we will see how that pans out.
And we take the same division, we had strong first half of the year and we said long may it continue but it may not and one quarter doesnÂt make a trend.
So, in that role, what are you doing to help JPMorgan and I guess the other banks in terms of China, the government shutdown, immigration, some of these headline issues that Marianne talked about, having hurt the CIB in the fourth quarter?
And then, my follow-up question is that obviously that capital markets had a tough time but you are wholesale lending, the growth has accelerated quite nicely.
For us in fact, it was largely driven by one investment grade loan that we extended at the end of the quarter but there was a little bit of an uptick and a little bit more in terms of acquisition financing and the balance sheet but nothing I would call -- nothing that I would call unusual or a trend.
But as long as you feel as we do that the decision criteria that we use to determine the investments we're making which we think are strategically important for long-term growth of the company and the profitability of the company, supporting clients, if those are good decisions for long term growth, while we could obviously make changes, we would not look to do that.
We think it sort of differentiates our long term performance and we'd like to continue to do that.
I guess what I'm getting at is, last quarter you had modeled -- I guess what I'm getting at is like, it's -- are we at the point where like just a couple of lumpy loans was going to drive a few hundred million reserve build or is it just -- maybe it's a bit unusual still.
So, there is no doubt that as things continue, if there is a level of anxiety and uncertainty, itÂs just not constructive for confidence and confidence that gets stronger or less strong market.
And I suspect weÂll get more color at Investor Day but just want to get your sense of the sustainability of growth and you mentioned on the commercial side, you maybe scale back a little bit, maybe weÂre late cycle.
So, I think itÂs -- and incredibly nuance question, because in general, home lending has a challenging market backdrop.
So, there is a challenging market backdrop, card was doing well at and itÂs sort factor of all things we talked about, investments in digital product, rewards all of the above.
And in many of our businesses, weÂre going to protect profitability and credit discipline over growth at this point.
Similarly, something like auto lease where we grew our auto lease business, revenues and expenses strongly in 2018 and that will be in our run rate in the first quarter.
So, itÂs fair to say that money market rates traded above IOER throughout the fourth quarter and more pronounced at the end of the quarter.
We continue to have a bit of that mix shift in the first quarter and itÂs a market opportunity.
And then, a separate question on, I know itÂs not a big revenue driver anymore but within mortgage banking, you had a negative gain on sale in the quarter.
And at some point, we would expect both of those things to normalize but we would continue to see solid growth in all of our drivers.
And so, if you look at your at banking system, if you look at the leverage lending bridge book in Â07, it was over $400 billion; today's itÂs number like 80.
Starting on Page 1, the firm reported fourth quarter net income of $7.1 billion and EPS of $1.98 on revenue of nearly $27 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 14%.
Market impacts aside, underlying business drivers remain solid, increasing core loans and deposit growth, consumer sentiment and spending in a robust holiday season, faster market activity and the credit performance continuing to be very strong across businesses.
For the full year 2018, the firm reported revenue of $111.5 billion and net income was $32.5 billion, both clear records even adjusting for the impacts of tax reform.
Non-interest revenue was down slightly, with lower market levels impacting Asset Wealth Management fees and Private Equity losses being offset by higher Card fees and Auto lease growth in CCB.
Non-interest revenues was up $2.5 billion or 5%, driven by CIB Markets and growth in Consumer being offset by Private Equity losses and the impact of spread widening on FCA.
And although we are showing modest positive operating leverage on a managed basis, remember our revenues were impacted by lower growth in Cards given tax reform.
Adjusted for this or looking on a GAAP basis, we delivered nearly 200 basis points of positive operating leverage for the year and well over 100 basis points for the fourth quarter.
Credit costs were $4.9 billion, down 8% driven by lower net reserve build in Consumer as well as the impact in 2017 of student loan sales.
Risk-weighted assets decreased with loan growth more than offset by derivatives counterparty and trading RWA given a combination of seasonality, market conditions and all the enhancements.
Despite volatile markets, client investment assets were still up 3% and we saw record net new money flows for the year.
In Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 18% on higher deposit NII driven by margin expansion.
And Cards, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 14%, driven by higher Card NII, although loan growth and margin expansion, lower card, net acquisition costs, principally Sapphire Reserve and higher Auto lease volumes.
Expense of $7.1 billion was up 6%, driven by investments in technology and marketing and Auto lease appreciation partly offset by lower FDIC charges and other expense efficiencies.
On Credit, net charge-offs was down $18 million as modestly higher charge-offs in Card were more than offset by lower charge-offs in Auto and Home Lending.
We maintained our number one brand rank for the year and continued to hold strongly lead-left positions in high-yield bonds and leveraged loans.
Total revenue was $3.2 billion, down 6% reported and down 11% adjusted for the impact of tax reform and Steinhoff margin loan loss last year.
A confluence of factors throughout the quarter including trade, concerns around global growth and corporate earnings, fears of lower mortgage fares as well as other negative headlines caused spikes in volatility which were amplified by markets that assets and liquidity.
And although we saw decent client flow, rates rallied, spreads widened and energy prices fell significantly, all against general market conviction that was anticipating a stronger end to the year.
Weaker performance across rates, credit trading and commodities was partially offset by good momentum in emerging markets.
Treasury services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13%, driven by growth in operating deposits as well as higher rates but also benefitting from fee growth on higher volumes.
Underlying this was strong fee growth and a modest benefit from higher rates together being substantially offset by the impact of lower market levels and the business exit.
Full-year IB revenue was a record $2.5 billion, up 4% on strong activity across segments, in particular middle market banking which was up 8%.
Deposit balances were up 1% sequentially as client cash positions are seasonally highest toward year-end although down 7% year-on-year as we continue to see migration of non-operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives.
Underlying credit performance remains strong with credit costs at a $106 million including higher loan loss reserves, largely due to select client downgrades.
Other corporate saw a net loss of $752 million, including on a pre-tax basis funding our foundation for corporate philanthropy $200 million this quarter, flat year-on-year, and including a $150 million of markdown on certain legacy private equity investments market related.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
Yes. ThatÂs about public policy, thatÂs good for growth of America in total, and so very specifically stayed away from doing about banks there.
Last one, obviously markets all went down in the fourth quarter and we had some freeze-ups if you will in high yield first time in like 10 years.
And right now itÂs good, sentiment in consumer and we just got back some sentiment from I hope small middle market companies that while not at their high, but still very high.
Yes. Based on the prior conversation, it seems like 1Q might be in aberration of mid single digits or should I take that thatÂs kind of the run rate you are expecting for the full year?
Jamie, you did make a comment recently at investor conference talking about how the banking industry is over-earning on credit, not particularly a controversial remark.
I think, I hate to say this because I know that you don't want to wait a few weeks but we'll have a more complete conversation about kind of range of total outcomes on credit at Investor Day but we -- when we gave our medium-term simulation we said listen, we did a 17 return on tangible common equity in 2018 and our medium-term guidance is for 17%.
I think people in general have done a better job underwriting middle market and leveraged up than it did last time.
ItÂs causing changes in that banks now have options other than reserves at the central bank because the two-year and three-year bond yields for corporate -- government bond is much higher, some people are preferring to own that because they think it would be paid better than corporate risk.
Before Marianne answers that question, I just want to do a shout out to Jefferies because we actually look at what everyone does and every investment banking group, and you guys did a hell of a good job in healthcare this year.
And you know importantly if it really is the case that we have to upfront significant amounts of capital for longer term and lower credit quality loans I do really believe even though the cash flows and the economics, secular change, that you might find people less willing to lean into growth for longer duration assets if there are concerns around potential business.

jpmc,q1,2019,"In the commercial bank we had record growth IB revenue, in asset and wealth management record AUM and client assets and the firm delivered another quarter of strong positive operating leverage.
Turning to page, two and talking into more detail about the third quarter, revenue of $29.9 billion was up $1.3 billion or 5% year-on-year, driven by net interest income which was up $1.1 billion or 8% on higher rates as well as balance sheet growth and mix.
Expense of $16.4 billion was up 2% relating to continued investments we are making in technology, real-estate, marketing and front office, partially offset by a reduction in FDIC fee charges of a little over $200 million.
Also in the page total assets are up over $100 billion quarter-on-quarter, basically driven by higher CIB trading assets in part and normalization from lower levels at the end of the year given market conditions.
Treasury services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year, benefitting from higher balances and payments volume, being partially offset by deposit margin compression.
Security services revenue was a $1 billion, down 4% as organic growth was more than offset by fee and deposit margin compression, lower market levels and the impact of the business exist.
Revenue of $2.3 billion was up 8% year-on-year on strong investment banking performance and higher deposit NII.
If we look across all of our hotel business, we also show strong growth year-on-year at about 8%, but there are three comments I would make; the first is that there can be reasonable noise in the fed weekly data; second, CIB is a big contributor for us, and CIB loan growth this quarter was supported by robust acquisition financing and higher market loans.
So while itÂs true that the Fed base was showing strong growth year-on-year and apples-to-apples ROE, in the domain stream middle market lending phase we are seeing good, mid-single digit demand in line with our expectation.
Revenue of $3.5 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as lower management fees on average market levels, as well as lower growth brokerage activity were offset by higher investment valuation gains.
Obviously a lot of the investments that we've been making in technology you know are also not only to do with customer service and risk management and revenue generation, but that also has to do with operating efficiency and we would also expect to start to see some of that drive, you know operating leverage.
Yeah, so I mean the first I would say is that you know, we probably said it before and weÂve seen these periods where you get kind of short term fluctuations in the curve is that, itÂs a big dangerous to chase it up and down every month or so.
So there is a little bit of pressure as a result of that, if it is persistent at this level throughout the year, but you know we continue to grow our loans and our deposits and against that, there is a mixed bag of lower for longer.
So while we may not have a tailwind of higher rates, we also may not have the same kinds of pressures that we would see on you know basis necessarily and while now longer and the rates maybe a net small drag in the short term on earnings, thatÂs a credit on the balance sheet and you could argue a patient FED and lower rates for longer may elongate the cycle.
I just Â I was hoping for a little bit more on the why, and to what degree does that reflect your build out of branches, how is that deposit growth going, how much of this is related to digital banking and then how much would be due to simply a perception that you have superior strength, I know that came up during the CEO hearing, the IMS study saying that you get a benefit due to a perception of being too big to fail?
So you record that we build a large number of branches following the financial crisis as we densified our position in new markets being California and Florida and Nevada and the like and so we do have a decent portion of our branches that are still in their maturation phase and so we are definitely seeing you know some growth in deposits there.
Year-over-year I would say you know we are see deposit growth grow exactly in line with our expectations, but this year the slowdowns speaks a little bit more as far as we can see to higher consumer spend and are little bit less to do with deposit flows out to rate-seeking alternatives.
What we are focused on is so both of these businesses that the long term growth opportunities are very big and the organic growth and the underlying businesses are performing well, and even with these revenue pressures we are focuses on continuing to drive efficiencies and these are good ROE businesses, you know above mid-teens.
Besides finding out Jamie's a capitalist, thatÂs shocking news, one of the risks that I think that the group talked about was in the private credit markets and non-bank lending and I just wanted to get a little qualifier of that Â I'm pretty sure you didn't mean the exposure JP Morgan has to those, itÂs just more risk being taken, but if you can just expand on that, that would be helpful.
The comments are really about the percentage of leverage lending or the percentage of some of our businesses that have now been taken outside of the banking market, and while you know we wouldn't say necessarily that that's systemic, being not systemic and suggesting that there won't be problems are two different things.
Net-net, it doesn't change our point of view that as we're at 12.1% CET1 right now, so arguably little bit above the high end of our range and continuing to grow earnings that we ought to be able to distribute a significant portion of earnings, but we always invest in our businesses first.
And then a separate question in the mortgage banking; it looks like gain on sale margins were at a high point as over the last five years this quarter.
My question is on the Treasury Services, year-on-year the growth going from double-digit you just grow to 3% where apparently the volumes remained healthy, but the margins started to deteriorate.
I just wanted to follow up on the net interest income, and it came in a lot better than expected this quarter.
Because if you annualize it, you're already above the full year target of $58 billion plus and obviously there's day count drag this quarter and really just puts and takes with rates and balance sheet growth, but it seems like the guidance is conservative versus where you're at right now.
You clearly seem more positive on the macro and obviously things can change there, but are you approaching from the balance sheet management a little bit differently, given may be more positive macro outlook?
It turns out that all the central banks are pointing to being a little bit more dovish, which couldn't generally be constructive for the environment and for credit risk on the balance sheet.
And so that's the environment that we look at to determine what's happening, and you know you've seen naturally over the course of the last couple of years as rates have been rising that we've seen flows of deposits to higher yielding alternatives, whether it's investments or whether it's more recently in CDs, and that may continue; we'll continue to watch that.
And my follow-up question is, we heard you loud and clear during your prepared remarks that the increase in wholesale non-accruals was idiosyncratic, and I'm wondering as we look at a tick-up in non-accrual loans in the Corporate & Investment Bank for the past two quarters, are we just in the part of the cycle where we're just growing from a low base or should we expect a step-down in the second quarter in non-accruals similar to how we saw last year?
Marianne just if I could ask you, you mentioned that there are some signs that the economy is strengthening, and I wanted to just ask you to Â can you split that between just what you're seeing on the consumer side versus the wholesale corporate side in terms of, the spend numbers are obviously still double-digit year-over-year, some others have talked about a little bit of a slowdown, you are just still saying quite good.
Yeah, I mean I think that as it relates to U.S. and in particular looking at the U.S. consumer, you've got all of jobs more recently, Auto, Housing, spend, all generally encouraging and holding up well and robust and whether it's double-digits or whether it's not, we're continuing to see that - and can see the confidence by the way, which is still very high and has recovered from any sort of hangout from the equity market actions over the four quarters.
We do still expect, as Dimon mentioned at Investor Day, that while we feel great about our positioning in investment banking in the first quarter.
First I want to ask as going to CCAR, now we're getting into that season again, one of the things that I think has an impact is that, what we had was a significant 30% plus growth in earnings last year.
So quarter-on-quarter Â and I think I mentioned a couple of these things, but across our businesses for a variety of reasons on an end-of-period basis loans are down.
But just underlying core business demand for bank balance sheet lending, you know I look at the middle-market space and say, we're still seeing solid demand.
We saw record client investment asset in consumer of over $300 billion and record new money flows this quarter, and double digit growth in both card sales and merchant processing volumes, up 10% and 13% respectively.
Non-interest revenue was up slightly as reported, but excluding fair value gains on the implementation of a new accounting standard last year, NII would have been up 5%, reflecting auto lease growth and strong investment banking fees and while market revenue was lower, there were other items more than offsetting.
RWA is up primarily due to high accounts cost of credit on trading activity, but notably this quarter being offset by lower loans across businesses on a spot basis.
Moving to Consumer & Community Banking on page four, CCB generated net income of $4 billion and an ROE of 30%, with consumers remaining strong and confident.
Revenues of $13.8 billion was up 9%; Consumer & Business Banking revenue up 15% on higher deposit NII driven by continued margin expansion; Home Lending revenue was down 11%, driven by net serving revenue on both lower operating revenue and MSR, but notably while volumes are down production revenue is up nicely year-on-year on disciplined pricing.
And product Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 9% driven by higher Card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and higher auto lease volumes.
Fixed income markets revenue was down 8% adjusted, driven by lower activity, particularly in rates and in current fees and emerging markets, which normalized following a strong prior year.
Equities revenue was down 13% adjusted, seeking more to the record prior year quarter and this quarterÂs performance, which was still generally strong across products.
Finally, expense of $5.5 billion was down 4% driven by lower performance based compensation and lower FDIC charges, partially offset by continued investments in the business.
Finally credit costs of $90 million was predominantly driven by higher reserves from select client downgrades and net charge offs were only 2 basis points on strong underline performance.
Expense of $2.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year but continued investment in our business, as well other headcount related expenses were partially offset by lower external fees.
For the quarter we saw net long-term inflows of $10 billion with strength in fixed income, partially offset by outflows from other asset classes.
AUM of $2.1 trillion and overall client assets of $2.9 trillion were both records of 4% driven by cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long term products and with third quarter market performance nearly offsetting fourth quarter declines.
Underlying drives across our businesses continue to propel us forward and in March and coming into April the economic backdrop feels increasingly constructed, client sentiment has recovered and recent global data shows encouraging momentum.
Your first question comes from a line of John McDonald with Autonomous.
Marianne you had good expense control this quarter and your Jamie's letter you show goals of improving the efficiency ratio on each of the main business units for the next few years.

Your next question comes from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC.
Yes. Okay, so first point on Treasury Services last year revenue growth was in double digits.
In other words, I know you discussed some dynamics on pricing for the first quarter, but when do you expect competition to taper off and do banks have room to actually lower deposit costs if the rate curve stays this way for a prolonged period of time?

jpmc,q2,2019,"Revenue of $29.6 billion was up $1.2 billion or 4% year-on-year as net interest income was up approximately $900 million or 7% on balance sheet growth and mix, as well as higher rates.
Excluding the recovery on a loan sale and home lending in the prior year, net charge-offs were up $80 million driven by card, as we continue to grow the portfolio.
Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as the impact of higher average market leverage was offset by lower investment valuation gains.
About $100 billion of that is squarely within our existing buyback, so you can think of this as highly targeted to high quality existing customers, and for the first time, weÂre actually seeing loan growth in cards as the majority of it coming from existing customers versus new customers, and so weÂre really shifting the paradigm there and we feel great about being able to harvest the opportunity that we talked to you about at investor day.
And so, we continue to focus on optimizing the balance sheet across capital and liquidity and so looking at loan sales and thinking about de-risking the portfolio from a servicing perspective, so good quarter on the back of the rally but it doesnÂt change the overall structural challenges.
If we had to say what it is today for next year, itÂd be something like $11.5 billion, and I think itÂs always becoming more efficient, but what you really have in tech is some things are becoming cheaper all the time and then youÂre also investing money all the time, which weÂre going to do regardless of the environment, so weÂre not going to cut things weÂre trying to build, like My Rewards programs and Chase My Loan and the credit journey because thereÂs a recession or something like that.
ThatÂs right, and our investments in technology create capacity in terms of productivity to continue to invest, and we talked a lot about AI and machine learning - itÂs early innings there and thereÂs a lot that weÂre going to be able to do to invest there and become more productive, and then cloud, developers can become more productive using the cloud.
You mentioned You Invest, you look at our client investment assets grew 16%, a portion of that was You Invest, and obviously You Invest cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build, so youÂve got to put all those things in perspective about how you start making decisions going forward.
Those things may be a little bit higher now than normal, but what I think we see is global growth is north of 3%, you kind of expect the United States to be 2.5% this year.
Importantly, as we always say, loan growth is an outcome, not an input, and we feel good about the loan growth that weÂre seeing in terms of the areas where weÂre investing, and for the full year you can think about a number if you adjust for the loan sales and ex-CIB of 2% to 3% full year.
We are still seeing some migration from non-interest bearing to interest bearing, but largely weÂre seeing those balances stabilize, and then we do of course have continued growth in the consumer bank.
In other words, if we think about if the ongoing rate and curve environment persists into next year after the two or three cuts this year, are we looking at a billion or is it way too complex to over-simplify like that?
Just given the range of outcomes are as broad as they are, and importantly if weÂre looking at cuts that are insurance cuts that sustain the expansion versus cuts that may be in response to a broader economic slowdown, there are other things that we would be talking about, so weÂre not going to give further guidance on 2020 until we know more.
No one wants to, a, [indiscernible] terrorism or criminal activities, and thatÂs going to be true for everybody involved in this, and thatÂd be banks even doing [indiscernible] for a long period of time, and those [indiscernible] I think will just become for everybody at one point, and they should.
WeÂre always going to want to have a management buffer, because as I had said, our first priority will always be to invest and grow our businesses, and then of course there remains a lot of uncertainty in terms of the regulatory capital framework.
I just want to remind you all that the nine quarters after Lehman, the real stress event, we made $20 million to $30 million, and CCAR assumes youÂre going to grow your balance sheet, it assumes youÂre going to continue your dividend and stuff like that.
So right now, itÂs for bank wholesale use to have immediate information, we all have the same information, you can move things; but eventually, youÂll be able to move money quicker with data, so yes, weÂre optimistic about that and weÂre going to roll that out as soon as we can and constantly test it and make sure itÂs secure and all that.
YouÂve got to look at the problem youÂre trying to solve, but people legitimately said, well, you didnÂt have real time payments - that was true, and now we do effectively sell from P to P, and we do effectively [indiscernible] real-time payments in TCH, so we are building the things that the future is going to want - APIs, Blockchain ledgers that have much more data, real-time moving of money that also goes through floor checks, etc.
Always remember, thatÂs who weÂre here to serve, and someone is going to pay eventually for services provided, but people like their credit cards.
So weÂre going to take and give our clients more and better and faster and cheaper all the time, and now we package that with [indiscernible] banking and [indiscernible] card, or discounts on mortgages.
Are you considering that, because IÂm just thinking about where fintechÂs is trying to exploit you, and I know itÂs a catchphrase - under-banked, that is being used by [indiscernible], doesnÂt necessarily seem like itÂs solving anything for them, but maybe youÂve got a better solution that we just donÂt focus on.
Then we have a product, which really is great, called Secure Banking, and think of it as a card but itÂs the full thing.
I think thatÂs going now 25% or--and weÂve kind of pushed that a little bit more, so weÂre always trying [indiscernible].
But weÂre not going to change the way we run the company because of the rate environment, weÂre going to continue serving our clients, investing with discipline, and managing the balance sheet across all dimensions, that being capital, liquidity and duration.
Then in terms of expenses, again weÂre not going to change the way we run the company because of an interest rate environment, and IÂll just say again that the range of outcomes are very broad here and so if we end up with insurance cuts, itÂs a temporary headwind, and if we end up with cuts in response to a broader economic slowdown, there will be a lot more to talk about.
There are also huge opportunities to spend your money wisely, so the Sapphire card was birthed in Â09 and you could imagine that--you say okay, we have this great opportunity but weÂre not going to take it, and so I think youÂve got to be very careful.
As you know, itÂs over four quarters and so we have time to think about it, but obviously pleased to have the flexibility.
Underlying performance for the quarter was strong with highlights including client investment assets in consumer banking up 16%, largely driven by net new money flows; in card, 11% growth in sales and 8% growth in outstanding; number one in global IBCs year-to-date, gaining share across all products and regions; steady results in the commercial bank with net income of $1 billion while continuing to invest in the business; and in asset and wealth management, record long-term inflows, AUM and client assets.
ItÂs important to note here that these variances include the impact of loan sales in home lending as we continue to optimize our usage of capital and liquidity across the firm.
Credit performance remained strong across businesses and we delivered another quarter of positive operating leverage.
Excluding that variance and the other offsetting notable items I mentioned, non-interest revenue was about flat with strong performance in consumer across auto lease, home lending production, and consumer and business banking, offset by lower markets revenue and IBCs as previously guided.
Expenses of $16.3 billion were up 2% related to continued investments in our businesses partially offset by a reduction in FDIC charges of approximately $250 million.
In consumer, credit costs of $1.1 billion were flat as higher net charge-offs were offset by net reserve releases.
And in wholesale, credit performance remained favorable with a net charge-off rate of 8 basis points, which was fully reserved for in prior quarters.
Home lending was down 17%, although excluding the MSR adjustment I just mentioned, revenues would have been up 4% driven by higher net production revenue on better margins and higher volumes, largely offset by lower NII on spread compression and lower balances.
Excluding the previously noted rewards liability adjustment, revenue was up 11% driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and the impact of higher auto lease volumes.
Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 4% driven by continued investments in the business and higher auto lease depreciation, largely offset by efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.
Fixed income markets were down 3% on an adjusted basis with relative weakness in EMEA partially offset by increased client activity in North America rates and agency mortgage trading, due to the changing rate environment.
Finally, expenses of $5.5 billion were up 2% compared to the prior year with higher legal expenses partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense.
Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 5% year-on-year predominantly driven by lower investment banking activity due to our outperformance last year and lower NII on slightly lower deposit balances.
Also worth noting here, gross IB revenue of $1.4 billion was up 8% year-to-date on strong syndicated lending and M&A advisory activity, and we continue to progress solidly toward our long-term $3 billion target.
The story here remains unchanged - we saw solid growth in areas where weÂve been investing, including expansion markets in specialized industries, offset by lower acquisition-related and short-term financing activities.
CRE loans were up 2% with modestly higher activity in commercial term lending, where clients are taking advantage of lower long-term rates, offset by declines in real estate banking where we continue to be selective, given where we are in the cycle.
Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 1% year-on-year as continued investments in advisors and technology were partially offset by lower distribution fees.
AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, both records, were up 7% driven by cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products, as well as higher market levels globally.
Revenue was $322 million, up $242 million year-on-year due to higher net interest income driven by higher rates and balance sheet mix, partially offset by net losses on legacy private equity investments versus net gains in the prior year.
I noticed that card loan growth was particularly strong this quarter.
Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
Just going back to JimÂs question, I noticed that investment securities balances continued to go up and mortgage loans were down another 5%.
Good morning, thanks for taking my questions.

Underlying performance continue to be strong with highlights including client investment assets in Consumer Banking, up 13%; strength in our consumer lending businesses, in particular on higher origination volume in Home Lending and Auto; and healthy growth in sales and outstandings in Card; number one in global IB fees year-to-date with over 9% wallet share and record growth IB revenues in middle market; and in Asset & Wealth Management, we saw record AUM and client assets.
Record revenue of $30.1 billion was up $2.2 billion or 8% year-on-year as net interest income was up $293 million or 2% on balance sheet growth and mix, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates.
Noninterest revenue was up $1.9 billion year-on-year or 14%, driven by strong performance across Fixed Income Markets and consumer lending, which included a gain on mortgage loan sales of approximately $350 million.
Expenses of $16.4 billion were up 5% on volume and revenue-related expenses as well as continued investments, partially offset by lower FDIC charges.
CCB generated net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32% with continued deposit growth and total loans down 4% year-on-year.
In Consumer & Business Banking, we saw strong deposit and investment growth year-on-year with deposits up 3% and client investment assets up 13%, reflecting continued growth across both physical and digital channels.
Home Lending revenue was up 12% on higher production volumes and margins, partially offset by lower NII on lower balances, which were down 12%, reflecting loan sales.
With regards to these loan sales, it's important to note the net impact to Home Lending revenue is minimal with the gain on sale being offset by a funding charge from Corporate.
And in Card, Merchant Services & Auto, revenue was up 9%, driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion as well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes.
Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 4% year-on-year, driven by continued investments and higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.
This quarter, CCB had a net reserve build of $50 million, which included a build in card of $200 million, largely offset by releases of $100 million in Home Lending and $50 million in Business Banking.
It was a record third quarter for investment banking fees, driven by strong performances in debt and equity underwriting, partially offset by lower advisory.
However, the pipeline remains healthy as strategic dialogue with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the lower rate environment has made debt issuance more attractive.
This quarter was characterized by strong client activities across the board with outperformance in agency mortgage trading and improved flows in rates and commodities.
Equity derivatives performance was challenged by lower client activity and unfavorable market conditions, but prime remained strong and cash outperformed relative to the prior year.
Expenses of $5.3 billion were up 3% compared to the prior year with investments and higher revenue-related expenses partially offset by lower litigation and FDIC charges.
And finally, credit costs were $92 million, driven largely by reserve builds on select emerging market client downgrades.
Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year with lower NII, driven by lower deposit margin, partially offset by higher noninterest revenue due to strong investment banking performance.
Gross Investment Banking revenues were $700 million, up 20% year-on-year on increased M&A and equity underwriting activity, and we saw revenues increase for both large deals and flow business with a record quarter in middle market.
Expenses of $881 million were up 3% year-on-year as investments in the business were largely offset by lower FDIC charges.
And in CRE, although there was higher origination activity in Commercial Term Lending, it was largely offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle.
Finally, credit costs were $67 million with a net charge-off rate of 9 basis points.
Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 1% year-on-year on continued investments in technology and advisers, partially offset by lower distribution and legal fees.
Credit costs were $44 million, driven by net charge-offs as well as reserve builds on loan growth.
AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets was $3.1 trillion, both record, were up 8% and 7%, respectively, driven by cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products as well as higher market levels.
Revenue was $692 million, up $795 million year-on-year, primarily due to higher net interest income driven by higher balances and balance sheet mix as well as the funding offset from the lower mortgage loan sale that I mentioned earlier, all of which was partially offset by lower rates.
Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Could you give us a little bit more color on how you're expecting those dynamics to play out, particularly given slightly lower core loan growth this quarter and 22% increase in investment securities balances?
And even though the deposit margin is higher year-on-year, not surprisingly, it is down 13 basis points quarter-on-quarter given the current rate environment.
Investment Banking revenue of $1.9 billion was up 8% year-on-year in a market that was down.
And for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, we ranked number one in wallet share for overall ECM and IPOs. We expect fourth quarter IBCs to be down both sequentially and year-on-year driven by strong performances in the third quarter and prior year.
Fixed Income Markets was up 25%, a good result, which also benefited from a comparison to a somewhat quiet quarter in the prior year.
Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as the impact of higher average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were offset by deposit margin compression.
And curious if you think we need changes in the structure of the market to function better on a go-forward basis.
And I think it's up to the regulators to decide they want to recalibrate the kind of liquidity they expect us to keep in that account.
But I think the real issue when you think about it, is does that mean that we have bad markets because that's kind of hitting a red line in that checking account.
But in terms of 2020, the way I think you can think about it is we've given you full year 2019, which implies a fourth quarter just under $14 billion.
But the fourth quarter of '19 in terms of run rate is not a bad place to start.
I know, as of the end of June, it showed that you had bumped up into the next GSIB bucket, and I wanted to understand how you're thinking about managing that as we go into year-end.
Is there anything that you would be looking to doing to get there that might reduce your positioning in some of the businesses that you're involved in, for example, things like derivatives, et cetera?
As you think about the cross current of resolution planning, LCR, and liquidity stress testing, could you help us -- what is the level of excess deployable cash at JPMorgan?
And as my follow-up, Jen, if -- you said something about the offset to the 2 Fed cuts that are in the forward curve would be balance sheet growth and mix.
But in terms of balance sheet growth in 2020, you can think about largely in deposits.
In terms of investment securities, when you look at the increase this quarter, there's a few things going on.
So there's a few things going on in investment securities this quarter.
And we're a little bit higher than what we said earlier in September at Barclays, and that's because we got a little bit of a tailwind on the 10-year and some balanced growth and 1 less cut in December.
First of all, broadly speaking, on expenses, I would say we remain committed to what we said at Investor Day in terms of the cost curve flattening from here.
I'd like to just -- and then our call centers, Mike, we don't necessarily think about it just in terms of the number of people.
So on client sentiment, I think it's fair to say that perhaps the marginal investment is being impacted by trade fatigue in terms of the uncertainty.
And in fact, quarter-over-quarter, we saw rates paid in the consumer businesses tick up a little bit on slight migration that we continue to see into interest-bearing.
First, is if you look at the balance sheet, security yields came down pretty significantly this quarter.
Because I think we've pointed out, if you had built the securitizations, you have a healthy mortgage market, you keep some on them on your balance sheet.
But with all this mixing into your last point there about where the deposit margin pressure comes in, do you expect the constitution of deposit growth to change at all, whether it comes from the consumer business, wholesale or the Wealth Management complex?
Look, I think it's difficult to know.
So at Investor Day, we said that the card revenue rate would be 11 50%, plus or minus.
Just I just want to follow up on -- you talked about the fourth quarter net interest come just under $14 billion, and that's not a bad place to start for next year.
So I do think -- and so as a JPMorgan matter, we're going to grow our businesses and serve our clients as best we can whatever the environment is.

Deposit growth accelerated in the fourth quarter across consumer and wholesale with average balance up 7% year-over-year.
We saw solid loan growth with Card and AWM being the bright spots as average loans across the company were at 3% year-on-year excluding the impact of home lending loan sales in prior quarters.

In Consumer and Business Banking, revenue was down 2% driven by deposit margin compression largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher noninterest revenue on the increasing client investment assets as well as accountant and transaction growth.
For the fourth quarter, CIB reported net incomes of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.5 billion, a strong finish to the year.
Total revenue was $5 billion, up 66% year-on-year driven by record fourth quarter revenue in both fixed income and equity markets.
Expenses at $5.2 billion were up 12% compared to the prior year with higher legal volume and revenue related expenses, as well as continued investments.
Fourth quarter revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year with lower deposit NII on lower margins largely offset by higher deposit fees and a gain on the strategic investment.
The CRE loans were up 1% where we continue to see higher origination in commercial term lending driven by the low rate environment, offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle.
Revenue of $3.7 billion for the quarter was up 8% year-on-year as the impact of higher investment valuation and average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were partially offset by deposit margin compression.
In fact, there from a rate paid perspective we continued in the fourth quarter to see rates pay pick up a little bit on migration from savings to CDs. And then on the wholesale side, we did see rates paid come down as you would expect and we could see betas accelerate after the second cut.
And then I would just say in terms of the outlook with the Fed on hold, the implies do still have one cut later in 2020 and based on the latest implies we'll give you more detail at Investor Day as we always do, but I would say NII for the full year of 2020 flat to slightly down as a headwind from rates will be offset with balance growth.
And so we saw sentiment improved a bit which I think contributed to the overall success of the fourth quarter and then certainly there are some puts and takes.
Obviously, labor market is very strong and the Fed and the ECB on hold and then capital spending is still a bit soft, but sentiment is at least certainly better than it was six months ago.
I guess on the provisioning side my question is more just on an ongoing basis is the mix changes more towards higher loss content lending which obviously have higher margins and higher profitability through the course --over the course of the loan in theory but like in that context I would --is it fair to say you're provisioning levels also could be materially above your charge-offs because I would think that your reserve ratios, your ALLL ratios do have to move up is that mix changes on your balance sheet.
And I think management had gave us in color that you'll continue to invest your efficiencies and initiatives no matter what the changes are in the revenue environment.
So, look, on the efficiency ratio, yes, I would say that like we've run the company with great discipline whether it's relentlessly pursuing expense efficiencies or investing with discipline through the cycle but because the efficiency ratio is an outcome not an input and is about expenses and revenue, we're not going to give a target for any one year.
We think about operating leverage over time and we always say we're not going to change the way we run the company for what could be temporary revenue headwinds.
Two questions, one on asset growth in the last couple of years fourth quarter, you have to go through this exercise of trying to squeeze down to hit the G-SIB target.
So we, I think we ended up at the low end as we through the year continue to get more certainty around what the macroeconomic forecasts were going to look like.
I guess first on expenses, full-year outlook was pretty clear less than 3% growth, but the first quarter seems a little bit higher than the maybe I would have thought up 4% year-over-year.
In the commercial bank, I mean you seen loans come down quarter-on-quarter for end of period and generally modest growth year-over-year.
So there are obviously some puts and takes which I'll run through but broadly speaking I would say what we're seeing is more a function of our own discipline than it is a function of demand and in C&I, we feel good about the growth that we're seeing in the areas where we're focused and specialized industries and market expansion, but of course that offsets partially by the tax-exempt portfolio that's running off and then in CRE good growth in commercial term lending as we continue to have opportunities there given the rate environment.
So obviously the bank has gained share but can you speak to future opportunities and runway and maybe this is more of a question for Investor Day, but specifically businesses like cash management, transaction banking and corporate clients in general.
I think going forward they'll obviously be some rate headwinds there which we think can be offset by organic growth, but given the investments that we have made there, Jamie mentioned InstaMed earlier.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak.
Client investment assets and consumer business banking were up 27% and asset and wealth management AUM was up 19% reflecting stronger market performance versus the prior year, as well as organic growth.
Revenue of $29.2 billion was up $2.4 billion or 9% year-on-year with net interest income down $220 million or 2% on lower rates largely offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB markets NII.
Revenue was up $7.2 billion, or 6% year-on-year with net interest income up $2.1 billion or 4% on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher average short-term rates, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates.
Noninterest revenue was at $5.1 billion, or 9% driven by growth across consumer and higher CIB markets revenues.
Revenue growth and our continued expense discipline generated positive operating leverage for the full year.
In consumer, credit costs were up $210 million reflecting an increasing card due to balance growth, largely offset by lower credit cost and home lending.
In Card, the increase is a result of moving to less time lost coverage versus a shorter lost emergence period under the incurred model whereas in wholesale modeling changes like using specific macroeconomic forecast versus through the cycle loss rates under incurred result in a decrease especially given the forecast to credit environments.
Home Lending revenue was down 5% driven by lower NII on lower balances which were down 17% reflecting prior loan sales and lower net servicing revenue predominantly offset by higher net production revenue reflecting a 94% increase in origination.
Expenses of $7.2 billion or up went by 2% driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business including market expansion largely offset by expense efficiencies.
This included a release in the home lending purchase credit impaired portfolio of $250 million reflecting improvements in delinquency and home prices, which was partially offset by a reserve build in card of $100 million driven by growth.
Fixed income markets was up 86% benefiting from a favorable comparison against a challenging fourth quarter last year, but also reflecting strength across businesses notably in securitized products and rates driven by strong client activity and monetizing flows.
Treasury services revenue was $1.2 billion down 3% year-on-year, primarily due to deposit margin compression which was largely offset by organic growth.
Gross investment banking revenues was $634 million, up 5% year-over-year driven by increased large deal activity.
Full year IB revenue was a record $2.7 billion up 10% on strong activity across segments with record results for both middle market and corporate client banking.
Finally, credit costs were $110 million with an NCO rate of 17 basis points, largely driven by a single name which was reserved for in prior quarters.
AUM of $2.4 trillion and overall client assets of $3.2 trillion, both records were up 19% and 18% respectively, driven by higher market levels as well as continued net inflows into long-term and liquidity products.
And you guys have been pretty clear that your business decisions are based on economic outcome or economic outcomes and not accounting outcomes and but CECL does materially change the way in which time -- changed the timing in which earnings accrete to book value in capital obviously with a higher upfront hit.
Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
I'm sorry, in fixed income, we call out securitized products and rate which were bright spots but broadly speaking obviously equities got a very strong quarter as well.
So just a question for Jamie because in the first paragraph you mentioned easing trade issues helped market activity.
Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.

jpmc,q1,2020,"Before we get into the first quarter performance, we want to start by recognizing that this is an extremely challenging time for all of us and our thoughts are with those most affected by COVID-19, particularly those on the front lines of this crisis.
But at a high level, these items are, a credit reserve build $6.8 billion; approximately $950 million of losses in CIB, largely due to the widening of funding spreads on derivatives; and a $900 million markdown on our bridge book.
Revenue of $29.1 billion was down $782 million or 3% year-on-year, as net interest income was flat to the prior year due to the impact of lower rates, offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB markets NII.
This quarter, credit costs were $8.3 billion including a net reserve build of $6.8 billion, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and net charge-offs of $1.5 billion, in line with prior expectations.
Our net reserve build of $6.8 billion for the quarter consists of $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly in card, and $2.4 billion and wholesale with builds primarily due to impact of COVID-19 as well as lower oil prices.
This reserve increase assumes in the second quarter that U.S. GDP is down approximately 25% and the unemployment rate rises above 10%, followed by solid recovery over the second half of the year.
In addition to these macro assumptions specific to each business, our consumer reserve build reflects our best estimate of the impact of payment relief that we are providing for our customers as well as the federal government stimulus programs.
Going forward, in order to leverage our balance sheet to serve our clients, we are prepared to use our internal buffers, which may mean our CET1 ratio falls below our target range and if necessary, we can also use regulatory buffers to go below our 10.5% minimum.
And lastly on this slide, credit costs included the $4.5 billion reserve builds I mentioned earlier and net charge-offs of $1.3 billion, driven by card and consistent with prior expectations.
Investment banking in the first half of the quarter showed continued momentum from last year, but as the market environment shifted, we saw delays in M&A announcements and completions, postponements of new equity issuance and increased draws on existing lines of credit.
At the same time, the investment grade debt market remained open and we helped our investment grade clients raise approximately $380 billion of debt in the quarter across a wide range of sectors.
And here, itÂs worth noting, our bridge book exposure is about a quarter of what it was, entering the 2008 crisis and is a higher quality portfolio.
ItÂs worth noting that even before the crisis, as we said at Investor Day, markets performance was strong for the quarter.
In wholesale payments and security services, tailwinds from this quarter, like elevated deposit balances, may be relatively short lived and more than offset by the impact of low rates and potentially lower transaction volumes if the crisis is elongated.
Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 10% year-on-year with lower deposit NII on lower rates and the $76 million markdown on the bridge book, partially offset by higher deposit balances.
Credit costs of $1 billion included the reserve builds I mentioned and $100 million of net charge-offs, largely driven by oil and gas.
Credit costs were $94 million, driven by reserve builds and the impact of COVID-19 as well as loan growth.
Based on the latest advice and what we know today, we expect to see further pressure from rates, partially offset by balance sheet growth in CIB markets and NII, which results in NII of about $55.5 billion for the full year.
In addition to the two significant items in the first quarter, these headwinds include a $3.5 billion decrease in noninterest revenue, all else equal, which is also due to the impact of rates and is the offset to higher CIB markets NII and therefore revenue neutral.
Although we donÂt quite know what the path will look like going forward, what we do know is that we will continue to be there for our employees, clients, customers and communities, as we always have been.
But, in terms of what weÂre seeing, those are the numbers, theyÂre still, as I said, relatively small compared to what we think weÂll ultimately see.
And so, we have assumed, as we could, for our first quarter results, the impact of those programs as well as the ultimate impact on payment relief that weÂll be providing for our customers.
And I just wanted to understand your thoughts on balancing, servicing your clients and also thinking about your capital levels relative to those automatic restrictions from the regulators.
And so, we think we have significant room to continue to serve our customers and clients through this crisis, but we are managing it quite carefully and looking at a range of scenarios.
But obviously, weÂre going to protect our company, our balance sheet,, our growth and weÂll be having close conversations with regulators about what that is.
But all else equal, given the deteriorated macroeconomic outlook, we would expect to build reserves in the second quarter.
Just given some of the significant declines at the long end of the curve, Jen, I was hoping you could help us think about where reinvestment levels are today, just compared with the 2.48% yield on the blended securities book?
And with lower rates, as low as the deposit growth that [Technical Difficulty] with the Fed balance sheet expansion, you do see a large increase in our investment securities portfolio this quarter, which makes a lot of sense.
How do we think about it in terms of how much is attributed to sort of mechanistic model related changes, where you calibrate your model for new economic scenario versus actual signs of stress that youÂre seeing your book that maybe arenÂt showing up in credit measures, but that you do think will show up in a reasonably short time period, call it within the next few quarters, how much of its growth, how much of its mix, just if you can talk to that?
And so, weÂre assuming as we think about our own capital plans that we will see revolver draws continue in the second quarter, albeit at lower level than the first quarter.
And then, from a credit perspective, as I said, we could see continued build over the next several quarters, but the way CECL works in theory, again, all else equal, is that that should be -- could be behind us by the end of the year, and we then have those reserves to absorb the losses that will inevitably emerge over the back half of this year and into 2021.
Can you give us any color on what kind of recovery youÂre expecting in the second half of the year thatÂs part of the CECL reserve building?
We know that we have a bridge loan book, because youÂre going to have quarters where things get bad and you might lose some money.
And like Jen said, so far if you look at spreads, itÂs probably a recovery this quarter.
Regarding credit cards, just based on payment rates that youÂve seen so far, and maybe the draws on revolves, how are you expecting card spending and card balances to trend over the next few quarters this year?
Because like I said, all else equal, given the macroeconomic outlook that weÂre looking at that we would expect to have a bill in the second quarter and perhaps, beyond, because as I said, obviously everything is incredibly fluid.
WeÂve mobilized our workforce around the globe to work remotely where feasible, including operations and finance teams, portfolio and risk managers, bankers and traders, ensuring they have the right tools to work effectively.
And while our call center capacity has been challenged, we quickly activated resiliency plans to address customer calls seeking assistance, and weÂve put in place new digital and self service solutions in record time.
For our customers who are struggling financially during this time, weÂre providing relief such as a 90-day grace period for mortgage, auto and card payments as well as waiving or refunding certain fees.
We continue to support our customers and clients by providing liquidity and advice during this challenging market environment.
And for our small business clients, weÂre actively supporting the SBAÂs Paycheck Protection Program.
And to help the most vulnerable and hardest hit communities as an initial step, weÂve announced $150 million loan program to give capital to underserved small businesses and nonprofits as well as a $50 million philanthropic investment.
While the underlying business fundamentals this quarter performed very well, we reported a number of significant items all due to impacts from COVID-19, which IÂll discuss in more detail later.
And on the far right, deposit growth accelerated meaningfully in March, most notably driven by wholesale clients as they secured liquidity and held those higher cash balances with us.
On the flip side, we saw significant net liquidity inflows into our government funds during March, which more than offset prime money market outflows.
Our balance sheet capital and liquidity going into this crisis were incredibly strong, and importantly allowed us to facilitate client needs in a period of stress.
And on the small business side, we saw significantly reduced inflows and merchant processing activities, early signs of pressure on payment and frequency rates as well as line utilization and increased demand for credit.
Average card loan growth was 8% with sales up 4% over the quarter, driven by January and February activity.
Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 3%, driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business, partially offset by structural expense efficiencies.
Equity underwriting was up 25% versus a challenged first quarter last year and we saw strong activity in January and February before the market effectively closed in March.
As clients focused on preserving liquidity, we experienced higher deposit levels in wholesale payments throughout the quarter, offsetting revenue headwinds from lower rates and payments activity.
Commercial banking reported net income of $147 million including reserve builds of approximately $900 million.
Expenses of $988 million were up 5% year-on-year, consistent with the ongoing investments we discussed at Investor Day. Deposits were up 39% year-on-year on a spot basis and increased about $40 billion during the month of March with about half of that coming from clients drawing on their credit lines and holding their cash with us as they look to secure liquidity.
Higher originations and commercial term lending driven by the low rate environment were partially offset by declines in real estate lending as we remain selective.
Expenses of $2.7 billion were flat year-on-year with higher investments in the business as well as increased volume and revenue related expenses offset by lower structural expenses.
At the same time, we saw $75 billion of net liquidity inflows driven by significant inflows into our industry leading government funds in March, as I mentioned earlier.
AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, up 7% and 4% respectively were driven by cumulative net inflows, partially offset by lower market levels.
And we now expect adjusted expenses for 2020 to be approximately $65 billion, largely due to lower volume and revenue-related expenses versus the outlook we provided at Investor Day. It goes without saying all of this is market dependent and weÂll keep you updated at future earnings calls.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
But the quality of these portfolios looks strong coming in as weÂve done surgical risk management over the last few years.
Jamie talked about an extreme adverse scenario in his ChairmanÂs letter that weÂve looked at assuming large parts of the economy remaining in lockdown through the end of this year.
There will be a point -- and the last question brought it up was where you get below 10% CET1, even though weÂll have almost $200 billion in capital and $1 trillion liquidity, all these other constraints start to kick in, like SLR and G-SIFI, advanced risk-weighted assets that may kind of constrain it.
Banks are very careful to support their clients in times like this.
Is this fair to look at the severely adverse stress cases on a bank-run modeling basis that we have access to and itÂs in line with that kind of level or is this something thatÂs even a little bit tougher, and specifically around like things like commercial real estate?
But IÂm wondering on the commercial real estate side, is there anything we should be thinking about thatÂs different from perhaps what a Fed stress test might have suggested in the past?
Like, you know -- youÂve got to respect the credit card delinquencies and charges will go up that weÂve seen very little bit so far.
But again, itÂs going to just completely depend on whether people are able to remain performing under a payment relief or forbearance program.
