boa,q2,2015,"WeÃ¢ÂÂve returned over $1.3 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends and looking at the results this quarter you can also see that we're making progress on our path to our long-term targets of return on assets and return on tangible common equity.
In the mass affluent space our Merrill Lynch product, it continues to have record assets and they were up 15% to over $122 billion and thatÃ¢ÂÂs on top of our investment brokerage services revenue teammates in U.S. We also continue to drive our 401(k) business and this year weÃ¢ÂÂve added some of the industryÃ¢ÂÂs largest companies to our platform.
In our middle market business, our commercial businesses, our companyÃ¢ÂÂs balance sheets are strong and they continue to drive loans at a higher rate than they did last quarter.
In the second quarter, we had $669 million of positive market related adjustments in net interest income, primarily driven by premium amortization on our debt securities from higher long-term rates.
On slide four, the balance sheet was up less than 1% versus the first quarter of '15 as loan growth and higher securities balances were offset by a decline in the ending balances within our global markets business.
If we look at lending activity on slide five, our reported loans on an end of period basis increased for the first time since the third quarter of 2013 growing $8.5 billion from the first quarter or 4% on an annualized basis.
Activity in our discretionary portfolio which is reflected in the LAS and all other box, where we used consumer real estate loans to manage interest rate risk in the LAS unit where we have home equity run-off portfolio together showed a decline from the first quarter of '15 of $15 billion.
In that light, global banking showed a continuation of loan growth from the end of the first quarter of '15, growing $11.4 billion or 4% during the quarter from a mix of C&I across large corporate and middle market as well as growth in commercial real estate.
If we adjust for those items our NII declined approximately a $100 million from the first quarter of Ã¢ÂÂ15 to just over $10 billion, as the impact of lower discretionary balances in consumer loan yields more than offset the impact of one more day of interest.
At the end of the second quarter an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel shift and increase in rates would be expected to contribute roughly $3.9 billion in NII benefits over the following 12 months and that split roughly 60% to short-end rates and 40% to long-end rates.
LetÃ¢ÂÂs go ahead and move to the businesses on slide 11, Consumer banking had earnings of $1.7 billion which was 4% greater than the second quarter of 2014 and 16% above the first quarter of Ã¢ÂÂ15 level.
Provision decreased $44 million from the second quarter of '14 driven by the continued improvement that we saw in both the credit card as well as the auto portfolios.
For example, the number of mobile banking customers continues to grow and increased to more than $17.6 million customers this quarter and these customers look to mobile devices for approximately 13% of all transactions -- all deposit transactions.
Mortgage banking income in this segment was up 8% from last year as originations had nice follow through from the elevated pipeline at the end of the first quarter as well as the higher productions margins.
Lastly, while we are bringing down our overall headcount in this business, we continue to invest in the growth opportunity of our preferred client base and we've been increasing sales specialists in the financial centers and that's resulted in increased activity.
If we turn to slide 13, Global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $690 million, which was up 6% from the first quarter of '15 level but down 5% from the second quarter of '14.
Compared to the second quarter of '14 solid fee growth was offset by lower net interest income, higher credit cost and modestly higher expenses, which resulted in a decline in year-over-year results.
Non-interest expense was modestly higher in the second quarter on the strength of our asset management fees as well as the continuing investment in client facing professionals.
If we look at activity and drivers on slide 14, asset management fees continue to grow and are up 9% from the second quarter of '14.
As I mentioned earlier we continue to experience strong demand in both our securities based and residential mortgage lending areas and we reached a new record for loans within the space during the quarter.
Earnings did decline 13% from the second quarter of '14 as lower non-interest expense was more than offset by lower net interest income, lower investment banking revenues and higher provision expense that was associated with the strong loan growth that we saw during the quarter.
Investment banking fees for the company were $1.5 billion, down 6% from the near record levels that we experienced during the second quarter of '14.
If we exclude a $188 million difference between periods on the sale of an equity investment, revenue was down 4% in the second quarter.
Sales and trading revenue of $3.3 billion ex-net DVA is down 2% from the second quarter of '14 levels.
Compared with the same period a year ago, fixed sales and trading was down 9% and not unlike what we saw in the first quarter of '15 strength within the macro-related products like FX, rates and commodities was offset by lower levels of activity within the credit product space.
So to wrap up, as Brian started the presentation with, many things that our teams have been focused on for some time came together nicely this quarter and that enabled us to report more than $5 billion in earnings and move closer to our long-term targets.
I think there is no question Betsy as we look at and I just remind people that we were at $3.9 billion for 100 basis point move.
If you look at the core net interest income ex the market related marks, it was down little bit versus last quarter but you are starting to see loans inflect as you mentioned earlier.
Do we start seeing stability in the core net interest income looking at the next quarter or two or do we really need higher short-term rates for that?
I think if you look at, we typically have a little bit of seasonal pressure in the second quarter and as we sit here today, based on the curve we would expect to see the core net interest income, which obviously excludes FAS 91 move up from Q2 to Q3 and weÃ¢ÂÂd expect further growth from Q3 to Q4.
Okay, and then on the discretionary book you mentioned it came down a little bit, when you look on a combined securities, mortgages basis and I guess as we saw long term rates go up and some banks have been increasing the discretionary book, with higher reinvestment rates or higher investment rates herein, whatÃ¢ÂÂs your thought on bringing that book down as rates have gone up?
But if you actually look at the amount of securities from a balance perspective they went up a little bit Q1 to Q2 based on the conversion of those loans to securities and as we continue to see the deposit footprint grow we will continue to invest and weÃ¢ÂÂre obviously mindful of the balance between increasing net income interest, like I spoke about as well as being sensitive to OCI risk.
Yeah, I think again, as we look and step forward that there are a lot of things that influence that number, one is obviously the ability and how much weÃ¢ÂÂve put up the increase in deposits to work through growing loans, and clearly weÃ¢ÂÂve seen, during the second quarter we saw that loan growth move up, which is obviously a good thing, which lessens some of that sensitivity.
And while this can bounce around a little bit I think what you're likely to see over the next couple of quarters is probably a convergence where the charge-offs and the provision number become more closely aligned.
As it relates to your question about the new loans, the responsible growth, if you looked and particularly in the areas that picked up during the second quarter, that on our risk rating scale they would translate to credits that tend to be in the strong triple B or single A area.
Just to follow up a little bit on that last point, when I was trying to shift through the core loan growth numbers this morning, it looked like the core loan growth coming out of the institutional bank and the wealth management looks strong.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs because we had -- weÃ¢ÂÂve been hitting increasingly record sales of credit card, so I think we did about $1.3 million this quarter, Bruce.
So if you look at that you can see itÃ¢ÂÂs across the board just little bit upside still, in part the interplay between some of the run off in the other category and the build-up in residential but they do a lot more themselves, loans in that place and so the investment sales levels that drives that Merrill Edge, in fact the FSA and the branches that we deploy do $4 million of notional on average a month of new investment products in building $4 million to $5 million, they sell, obviously check accounts, net check-in accounts this quarter we had a net check-in account growth position even taking into account the run off from divestitures and other things, and then you have the loan side.
So you can think of them - you're right that sales force -- that [ph] segment that it has a benefit across the board, and then services, a lot of our customers business, business banking, commercial banking customers coming to the branches obviously for cash related, really to the cash management revenue.
And I would just add if I may, if you look at home equity it's a good example of where, if you look within the consumer banking space and during the second quarter of this year the home equity originations of line amounts were about $3.2 billion.
The second thing I talked about better collateral management as well as looking to work, to do more compression and to net things out and we continue to see some benefit there.
Okay and then my second question, this just relates to the wealth management business and Bruce you alluded to there being a little bit of a slow down on the revenue.
The second thing that I do think is important is that when you look at the net interest income line, that as I've mentioned it looked a little bit muted.
Yeah, I say, a few quarters we saw the margin, the pretax margin come down and you are seeing it start to turn back and go up, and there is positive pressure on the future on that after the end of this year because some of the deal stuff runs out will add a couple of points to margin.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs got $250 billion deposits, round numbers, a lot of loans and it has a lot of the same sensitivity our consumer bank does, that people don't think of in this context.
But I think net-net if we do a good job of managing this the way that we would expect to, that absent any exogenous changes we should be able, in the institutional business, which is both global banking as well as sales and trading, that we should be able to grow loans while at the same time having -- have reductions in the overall risk weighted assets that are attributed to that area.
So, yeah I think itÃ¢ÂÂs really much more but a continuation of the work that weÃ¢ÂÂve been at for several years now, and weÃ¢ÂÂre mindful of making sure that we continue to push that stuff out at the same time that weÃ¢ÂÂre originating those things that will perform well as part of that overall exercise.
So think about that, that's up from 2,000 last year second quarter, 10,000 times a week now and growing at that rate implied there.
But if you think about, we've added mortgage production, check-in accounts, net new, the credit cards and thatÃ¢ÂÂs -- the ramification that we give service and driving it the team has continued to work at it.
So think about that, if people didn't like us a lot they wouldn't be giving us their core check-in accounts and that is happening more and more every quarter and that we will service well as rates change because we are a hugely primary focused check-in account company in the broad mass part of the business, which is different than the past.
So I'd be a little bit careful with that characterization and I think in that context I go back to Brian's initial comments which we continue to push hard, weÃ¢ÂÂre adding client facing personnel across the company at the same time we are reducing aggregate headcount and thatÃ¢ÂÂs leading to declines in the expense numbers, and weÃ¢ÂÂre very, very focused on continuing to keep that balance as we go forward.
And I think whatÃ¢ÂÂs important is as you look to the past, to what we have talked we are basically there in the second quarter you can say you have the $700 million in FAS 91 the 400 of loan sale gains and a couple of hundred million from rep and warrant provision but what I think is interesting and as you look at the past Eric, if you look at and assume the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve what that would mean in the quarter as well as if we ultimately get to where our LAS expense goals are you basically back to all other things being equal where we were this quarter.
I think this quarter was reflective of the way youÃ¢ÂÂd expect us to manage it which is the pure sales and trading number was down 2% and total expenses within the segment were down 5%.
So before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me just remind you we may make some forward-looking statements and for further information on those please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.
We saw continued improvement in our net charge-offs and credit quality; our deposits in our consumer continue to grow even faster this quarter than prior quarters.
This quarter again we averaged about 5,000 new customers a day to our mobile banking platform, but importantly the team continues to make progress in bringing that platform into the company in multiple ways.
The quarter also included $373 million in benefits from consumer real estate loans which added $0.02 a share.
Provision for credit losses this quarter was $780 million and included improved net charge-offs on an adjusted basis as well as less reserve release compared to the first quarter of 2015.
Return on tangible common equity this quarter was 12.8%, return on assets was 99 basis points and the efficiency ratio was 62%.
If we adjust for those metrics for the few items I mentioned earlier, return on tangible common equity was 10.9%, return on assets was 85 basis points and the efficiency ratio was 65%.
Common shareholdersÃ¢ÂÂ equity improved, the solid earnings growth was partially offset by a $2.2 billion decline in OCI and $1.3 billion in capital return to common shareholders.
Among other initiatives, the management team challenged our corporate and commercial lenders for the past several quarters to more fully utilize the credit limits, to drive responsible growth.
Our wealth management business continues to experience strong demand in both securities based lending as well as consumer real estate.
If we look at our Basel III regulatory capital on a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $1.1 billion driven by earnings partially offset by the OCI decline, share repurchases and dividends.
Our global excess liquidity sources reached a record level during the quarter at $484 billion and now represents 23% of the overall balance sheet.
U.S. consumer credit card delinquencies improved as well and on the commercial front we saw an uptick in NPLs and reservable criticized exposure from the first quarter driven by downgrades in oil and gas exposures.
Releases in consumer card and consumer real estate were partially offset by reserve bills within the commercial loan growth area.
Card income increased 5% from the second quarter of '14 on strong sales and solid spend levels.
Card issuance reached almost $1.3 million units in the quarter on increased sales efforts while the average book FICO score was also strong.
Net charge-offs declined from very low levels and were 2.7% in the second quarter and risk adjusted margins remained high at roughly 9%.
Non-interest expense did decline 3% from the second quarter of '14 as lower litigation and other technology initiative costs were partially offset by investment in client-facing personnel.
Advisory fees were up 5% during the quarter, debt underwriting was relatively stable as increased activity in the investment grade and other products offset the declines that we saw within our leverage finance area.
Outside of investment banking fees other banking revenue declined from leasing gains partially offset by modestly higher treasury fees and card income.
Total revenue, excluding net DVA declined from the second quarter driven by lower equity investment gains, lower sales and trading results and lower investment banking fees.
Equity's trading was up 13% year-over-year driven largely by increased client activity within the Asia Pacific region as well as a strong performance within the derivative area.
The foundation of the company's balance sheet has never been stronger with record capital and record liquidity levels and we remain well-positioned to benefit from a rising rate environment.
I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs in the broadest context we continue to work expenses and if we talk to, about each quarter 18 straight quarter reduction in core operating expenses outside litigation, 15 straight quarters, 3,000 people or more reduction each quarter.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs really in your last question weÃ¢ÂÂve been investing in headcount to open up our customer facing capacity, so I replicated some of statistics earlier.
So all-in-all as we look at those different factors itÃ¢ÂÂs why weÃ¢ÂÂre comfortable saying that weÃ¢ÂÂd expect the quarter increase both Q2 to Q3 as well as from Q3 to Q4.
Great, thanks very much for the answers to my question.
Okay, just the whole idea there is just trying to get at the DOL proposal and maybe what could be potential downside even based on how it all gets finalized understanding that itÃ¢ÂÂs preliminary at this point?
Okay, and then looking at the branch declines that you guys referenced earlier, is the tweak on the sort of 5% year-over-year, as a reasonable decline rate sustainable from here given the trends that youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in your mobile platform and could this potentially add additional GUs [ph] to your expense decline beyond the business as usual type pushing that you guys spent a lot of time talking about here in the call today.
Hi, I just wanted a follow up on BetsyÃ¢ÂÂs question, at the start talking about expenses being at a run rate or maybe going lower.
And we will take our final question from Christopher Wheeler from Atlantic Equities.
",49.72,0.47526452
boa,q3,2015,"Our capital is again at record levels, and we returned over $3 billion back to shareholders so far this year through common share repurchases and dividends.
Our Merrill Lynch teammates who work within our consumer business helped push us through a new standard of 2 million accounts this quarter.
Thanks Brian, good morning everybody.
Tangible book value increased 10% from Q3 last year, and our tangible common equity ratio grew to 7.8% as equity improvements outpaced asset growth.
With regard to regulatory capital I want to start by pointing out that our transition ratios under Basel III increased with CET1 ending the quarter at 11.6%.
Non-interest income benefited from divestiture gains as well as higher card income driven by increased customer activity while service charges declined.
Expenses declined from Q3 last year despite a 5% increase in sales specialist and higher fraud costs in advance of ruling changes regarding EMV chip implementation.
The cost of operating our deposit franchise remains low at 180 basis points, and the consumer bank reported an efficiency ratio of 57%.
U.S. card credit volume was strong as net charge offs declined this quarter to a decade low of 2.5% driving risk-adjusted margins higher to 9.3% excluding divestitures.
Turning to slide 11, global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $656 million.
The trend of lower transactional revenues continued this quarter as clients migrated from brokerage to managed relationships which was compounded by lower markets and muted new issuance.
Second, operating leverage was challenged as areas of revenue where incentives are high like asset management grew while NII where incentives are much lower declined.
Turning to slide 13, global bankingÃ¢ÂÂs earnings were 1.3 billion, generating a 14% return on allocated capital.
The comparison to Q3 last year reflects higher provision expense and lower NII driven by the companyÃ¢ÂÂs ALM activities as well as increased liquidity costs.
Despite a lower level of IBCs this quarter, we maintained our number three global fee position and believe we increased our market share as industry fees pools declined.
On deposits we saw good performance with average deposits increasing by $8 billion over Q2 and we continued to optimize the portfolio improving the composition towards higher quality deposits from an overall LCR perspective.
Earnings were up from Q3 last year which included litigation cost of roughly $600 million most of which was non-deductible for tax purposes.
Total revenues excluding net DVA declined from Q3 last year driven by lower fixed sales and trading and to a lesser extent IBCs, offset partially by improved equity sales and trading.
Non-interest expense excluding litigation improved a $102 million versus Q3 last year, up 4% improvement.
Conversely, market activity remained muted in credit products driving lower client activity this quarter than Q3 last year.
As a reminder, our mix remains more heavily weighted towards credit products driven by the strength of our new issues capability and market share.
Lastly, I want to focus on expenses which excluding litigation were flat compared to Q2 as increased professional fees offset improved operating cost from the decline in delinquent loans.
The pretax loss was a result of a negative NII market related adjustments and an increase in provisioning for UK credit card payment protection insurance.
Sure so I am assuming some loan growth and adjusting for day count we would expect normalized NII excluding marketable adjustments to be flat to grind up and as long as rates donÃ¢ÂÂt decline in the future.
So core expenses which everybody excludes litigation LAS are expected to remain relatively flat at probably a little less than 13 billion per quarter in a moderately improving business environment.
We always manage the balance sheet against all the different constraints and you can see the improvement in the pro forma advanced ratio by 40 basis points this quarter closing down the gap.
Okay, secondly, another credit quality question.
Our next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
When we think about the quarter, the key message is we continued to make good progress in a tough revenue environment due to low interest rates and a sluggish economic recovery.
We continued to make progress towards our full earnings capacity here at Bank of America, and this quarter represents the fourth consecutive quarter of solid results following the resolution of our large legacy exposures in the third quarter of last year.
Our teams here at Bank of America are focused on the everyday engagement with our customers, deepening relationships by growing the core things we do with them, deposits, loans, managing their risks, helping them invest their assets, all while keeping our cost down, and you can see that in our results.
In our consumer banking business, as you can see, we grew revenue and earnings year-over-year despite the low interest rate environment.
When we go to our wealth management business, this business is showing the effects of lower market valuations pressuring revenue, but actively here has reflected good long term flows, good deposit flows, and good loan growth.
Our net interest income in the company is benefiting from loan and deposit growth showing momentum this quarter after you exclude the impact of FAS 91.
Expense less litigation LAS costs remain well below the $13 billion threshold at $12.7 billion, and that was in line with our second quarter despite the additional costs of CCAR and additional investments in the business.
We are taking the benefits of our simplify and improve program, which keeps our costs flat, while we continue to invest in customer-facing client people to grow our businesses.
So, in the context of the environment we faced, we are operating what we feel is a solid quarter, and as evidenced, the continuing progress on our strategy, our strategy of responsible growth with our customs.
Revenues were 20.9 billion this quarter, expenses were 13.8 billion, significantly lower than a year ago because of litigation costs and compared to Q2, expenses were flat as we managed costs well, while investing in our franchise.
Turning to deposits, on an ending basis, they reached 1.16 trillion this quarter, growing 50 billion or 4% over Q3 last year.
Excluding litigation, expenses were 13.6 billion in the quarter, a decline of 600 million or 4% from last year and consistent with Q2 despite additional costs related to our CCAR submission.
With respect to NII compared to last year, the benefit of higher deposit levels was more than offset by the allocation of ALM activity and lower card yields [ph].
In the future, mortgage banking income in the consumer segment will be lower by approximately $30 million per quarter given the Q3 sale of a small appraisal business.
On NII, the benefits of higher loan and deposit flows was more than offset by the company's ALM activities driving NII down from Q3 last year.
Long-term AUM flows were more than 4 billion, deposits increased more than 7 million, average loans were up 10% from last year, our 22nd consecutive quarter of loan growth in this segment.
Investment banking fees for the company this quarter were 1.3 billion, down 5% from Q3 last year.
Looking at the balance sheet, loans on average were $310 billion up 9% year-over-year and a similar percent relative to Q2 on an annualized basis.
First, the number of delinquency for mortgage loans continued to decline down 14% this quarter as the teams continued to work through solutions for customers.
I was just wondering if you can maybe just speak a little bit about the NII outlook given the dynamics about the stable balance sheet, shifts within the balance sheet, and how we should think about both the GAAP and adjusted NIM if the interest rate environment continues to look more or less like it does today.
In the fourth quarter, we think theyÃ¢ÂÂll wind up slightly based upon the realization of the expected forward curve and some loan growth.
I think we just look at commercial loans year-over-year at 10%, last quarter up 3% so you got to annualize that out and what weÃ¢ÂÂre looking at is that we replaced discretionary assets with actually good core assets.
Sure, so the short answer to your question but then IÃ¢ÂÂd like to elaborate a little bit more is yes we kept core expenses flat and we absorbed CCAR expenses and other investments in the business in the quarter.
Just take a step back I think the way we would ask you to think about expenses is we are seeing good expense progress within our business importantly as we continue to invest in the future.
One more point Brian, I would remind everybody that we did guide you that we would have increasing cost expenses in the second half of the year so we do have a little bit of that in the fourth quarter as well.
We are laser focused on keeping it to that kind of level where we continue to invest in the thousand plus people to go generate the business growth you are starting to see.
Okay, and then just separately in terms of the credit quality comments that you provided for the next several quarters, how are you thinking about energy as part of that?
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs all helpful and maybe just on the loan growth side what are you seeing on the demand side, consumer has begun to pickup for you guys where are you seeing the most strength and do you think the environment still is pretty positive from a loan demand perspective in the U.S.?
We think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a competitive advantage for people entering this business and we will continue to invest in that.
In terms of whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on in terms of the mix shift on balance sheet, added some of the discretionary assets and into the core loan growth, I think everybody will take that all day long.
I think as you think about it remember that if we go look at page 5 and you look at the content of whatÃ¢ÂÂs leading coming on especially in the consumer business and then think about running that through all kinds of models including the CCAR process and think about getting rid of $5 billion of home equity loans which are basically non performing and putting on $3 billion of good home equity loans, that dynamic is pretty favorable to the overall sort of calculation and so.
But donÃ¢ÂÂt think of it as changing credit quality or taking any kind of more risk, so Tom and Dean that run that business for us has done a good job and so IÃ¢ÂÂd say the supply has been more from a delivery capacity than it is from an expanding the box or anything like that.
But if you go on business banking, commercial banking, and global corporate investment banking segment, our three versions, [Indiscernible] the team theyÃ¢ÂÂve actually hired over a 100 people, loan officers this year.
Okay, got it, and then Paul one quick follow up on GWIM, just remind us how that business kind of marks itself in terms of the asset level pricing versus the transactions.
So what do we need to think about in terms of where the markets have come and where we are looking ahead in terms of assets levels versus transaction type revenue activity?
I mean we grew it a little bit slower this quarter but in a bad market environment we continue to grow AUM, we continue to grow deposits, we continue to grow loans.
Most have been asked and answered but one quick question on the servicing side, the servicing income has been coming down at sort of a faster rate than the portfolio and I know you guys have sort of exited most of the sales on the portfolio side, so at what point can we sort of expect the fees to level off and is that just a function of the legacy stuff continuing to run off?
In terms of what we do in the environment, as we have said a lot of times to earlier questions, we continue to be able to hold the core expenses flat while we make the investments pay - the increased CCAR expenses pay for the cost of repositioning the franchise, severance and everything and we will continue to work at it.
If the environment changed and we didnÃ¢ÂÂt think weÃ¢ÂÂre getting returns from that, [weÃ¢ÂÂll just go] [ph] for the long-term interest of our shareholders, we would reduce the investment rate.
",48.47,0.6759686
boa,q4,2015,"Our consumer and wealth management businesses serving mass market customers all the way to the wealthiest Americans delivered $9.3 billion in net income this year.
Our Global Banking business which provides services to small, medium and large companies around the world, produced $5.3 billion in net income this year.
As you see on slide 2, across the variety of measures, loan growth business activity, capital liquidity, credit losses and cost management, we've made meaningful progress and believe we are positioned for a variety of economic cycles.
Now our liquidity levels were driven by strong growth in deposits this year and we were able to put that funding to work to grow loans on an absolute basis for the first time in several years.
As you can see, we grew average deposits in consumer banking and wealth management business is $52 billion or 7% comparing year-over-year fourth quarter periods.
If you look at the markets business Tom Montag and team have done a good job of reducing assets and lowered the risk and still are generating relatively stable revenues.
Expenses were $13.9 billion approximately $300 million or 2% lower than a year ago driven by good expense discipline across the company.
We also provide returns and a few other metrics on this page, I would remind you that client activity and revenue in our global market segment tend to be lower or lowest in the fourth quarter affecting returns on other statistics.
Turning to slide 6 and focusing on the balance sheet, we grew deposits by $35 billion from Q3 and we used these increased deposits to fund responsible loan growth.
In total assets climbed $9 million as increases in loans and security balances of $30 billion were more than offset by reductions in trading related assets and cash.
Total net charge-offs increased $212 million versus Q3, $144 million was from consumer items previously reserved for and lower recoveries on the sale of NPL in the fourth quarter versus Q3.
Moving to our commercial side, on slide 10, net charge-offs increased $75 million primarily from losses in our energy portfolio.
Before moving from asset quality I want to refocus on total provision expense and how one should think about it over the next couple of quarters.
This improvement was driven by increased deposit balances which we used to fund growth in loans and securities.
Although more than half of that improvement comes from the increases in short-end rates and a little less than one quarter of the benefit comes from market related adjustments.
Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 13, consumer earned $1.8 billion, 9% greater than Q4 last year.
Results were down from Q4 last year driven by lower transactional revenue and the impact of the market decline on asset management fees.
Moving to slide 16, despite the volatility and market levels we continued to see solid client activity and we continued to invest in the business growing wealth advisors 5% from Q4 last year.
Provision expense was up $264 million from Q4 last year driven by higher energy related charge-offs and reserve build to loan growth and energy related risks.
Total revenue excluding DVA improved $330 million or 10% from the fourth quarter last year on improved FICC sales and trading.
I just wanted to dig in on a couple of things, one was on energy since itÃ¢ÂÂs flavor of the day, you gave a lot of color there and you indicated that those $30 holds for nine quarters that is a loss of $700 million.
Sure, look as we said in comments we have got reserves against that energy portfolio of $500 million, that is 6% of the high risk subsectors and we developed reserves on incurred basis, we developed them by looking at loss give default, probability of default, exposure to default.
That is kind of all run through the system, so now what weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing is $80 billion of a period deposit growth from fourth quarter last year and this year and the overall pay rate for that is in the low single digit basis points all for, all the consumer wealth management and driven by middle market and the banking business.
We think that makes sense and given the quality of our deposit base as Brian sort of kind of walked through already the portion we have in our consumer and GWIM franchises, the number of primary checking accounts even on the wholesale side if you look at our deposits less than 5% of them are 100% runoff deposits.
Well if you look at the full-year 2015 and you do those puts and takes for the things that weÃ¢ÂÂve talked about for the year and you make any sort of a reasonable guess as the progress weÃ¢ÂÂre going to make around LAS, weÃ¢ÂÂre sort of in the kind of 65ish range, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue to focus on growing responsibly and working on our total expenses as we have talked earlier and so with a little help from growth and some more work on expenses we think weÃ¢ÂÂre in shooting range .
As we model ourselves and look at sort of the peers and so that average efficiency by business units and model against our business mix weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be little higher, high level wealth management in our business relative to total.
But look three things on this, number one we will continue to drive Ã¢ÂÂ drive it down and funding all the growth in FTE for sales side we get 6% growth in consumer FTE sales side, 3% wealth management, 6% or 8%, maybe 8% global banking year-over-year.
So I think you put the heat on a little bit on loan growth over the last couple of quarters and if you looked at lending in your primary lending segments itÃ¢ÂÂs picked up and I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs good.
The question I have is, if you look at the core loan growth are you still okay running it at this level, do you feel like your customer base that youÃ¢ÂÂre making these new loans too are a little more insulated to the world that the market is fearful of?
I would remind everybody that we look weÃ¢ÂÂre very, very focused on our customer framework and our risk framework, but within that framework we continue to see a lot of opportunities that help our customers grow their businesses.
If you look at this quarter and you just focus on the core, we had 3% quarter-over-quarter growth or an annualized growth rate of little over 12% or $22 billion, IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to sit here and tell you that is what is going to be next quarter, but weÃ¢ÂÂre not seeing material decline in conversations with our clients about how that thing grows.
If you think about the consumer you know there was a prime no longer FICO scores if you look at the coming on FICOs are higher than the portfolio still which is almost hard to believe, the charge-offs, delinquencies and both home equities, delinquencies across the wide score are going to continue to come get lower every year.
And then again, as I pointed out, weÃ¢ÂÂve got a business here with close to $140 billion in loans and $240 billion, $260 billionish of deposits, and as rates move, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to start seeing some benefit from that with which the payout ratio is quite different than on the more traditional asset management products.
Yes, just I think people have to think about, Steven, the margin has come down, we think itÃ¢ÂÂs flooring out here and will start to pick back up in part because of some of the unfundamental changes in the ATP program running off and stuff, but we have invested in a PMD program, it cost a few hundred million dollars of drag to do that, thatÃ¢ÂÂs the right thing to actually build advisor base over time to service the clients.
But the one thing overall is that as you look at the question on the exposure that weÃ¢ÂÂre also paying close attention to is it sort of a demand or supply issue for oil prices, and if itÃ¢ÂÂs a supply issue that affects these companies and related companies demand and demand from, but if it is a demand in the broadest context, i.e., economies need to continue to slow down and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the broader concern.
And so, there is a balance here that weÃ¢ÂÂve got to think through right now thatÃ¢ÂÂs pretty isolated the energy companies, and even if you look at consumers who work for them in our basis by ZIP code and unemployment levels and stuff, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen relatively modest deterioration in the consumer side before employing these businesses.
I was just wondering if you could help me think through a little bit your GAAP and risk weighted assets over the first half of the year given the growth dynamics that are pretty robust in some of the run-offs and then also some of the changes that are going through on the RWA calculations?
Well on a standardized basis, I think youÃ¢ÂÂre going to see RWA trend up if weÃ¢ÂÂre able to grow deposits and loans.
I think itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be, continued to be driven by commercial, but you're going to see growth in consumers as well.
I would - there has been good progress, I think if you look over the last year, the number of non-conforming loans that we are originating has increased meaningfully.
From a broader -- leave aside the fees because of the geography and how the accounting works and when you put 60%, 70% loans on balance sheet, in terms of overall production we expect to continue to make progress because you can see that numbers that weÃ¢ÂÂre going to Ã¢ÂÂ as other people are flattening out, we continue to have lots of opportunities with our core customers setting out and still that are creditworthy in our customer base, we are still getting to move it elsewhere and that is what the team is chipping away.
Our credit people do spend a lot of time just homing [ph] through that portfolio and looking at cash flows from the companies and making sure we understand the collateral, making sure we fully understand our structures, so I think itÃ¢ÂÂs just a lot of locking and tackling and talking to clients and making sure we understand whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on with their businesses in terms of the energy portfolio.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve seen a little bit of increase the last couple of quarters, but that again I think is just a reflection of things that's bumping around at really low levels.
Rates get us part of it and hard work on expenses and core revenue growth and driving gets us the rest of it, and so LAS expense drop-in, and we're chipping away that, if you look from '14 to '15, we made substantial steps, and we will continue to drive away.
Within our institutional investor clients our markets business with its market leading research capabilities and the top tier platform across the globe delivered $3 billion in earnings after adjusting for DVA in a very challenging market.
These results reflect the work we've done over the past several years to develop a more straightforward and simplified operating model and focus on responsible growth.
Commercial charge-offs increased off a very low base mostly from oil related charge-offs while consumer losses as a core continued to improve.
We have record loan levels and significant higher deposit levels, good products and [advisers] [ph], a growing sales force and two of the leading brands in business positions us well here..
These included a negative net DVA impact in sales and trading that was more than offset by positive impacts of market related adjustments in net interest income and some one-off tax benefits.
Turning to regulatory metrics we began recording regulatory capital under the advanced approaches for the first time this quarter, and the CET1 transition ratio under Basel 3 ended the quarter at 10.2 and really has no comparable metrics as transition ratios in prior periods were reported under the standardized approach with lower RWA levels.
On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved modestly to $154.1 billion under the advanced approaches compared to Q3 2015 pro forma estimates the CET1 ratio increased slightly to 9.8%.
RWA was essentially flat as growth from commercial exposures was mostly offset by lower activity and balance sheet levels in our global markets segment.
Here our CET1 ratio was flat at 10.8% with modest improvements in capital offset by modest increase in RWA.
Turning to asset quality on slide 8, while still strong we did see net charge-offs increase modestly from recent levels.
Reserve releases in consumer real estate and credit card were partially offset by reserve builds in commercial which was driven by increase in criticized exposures as well as loan growth.
Turning to net interest income on slide 11, on an FTE basis NII was $10 billion increasing roughly $300 million from Q3.
NII also included a $150 million of positive market related adjustments to the amortization of bond premiums under FAS 91.
This is important because it allows us to invest in growth while maintaining relatively flat core expenses and a sluggish revenue environment.
Looking towards expenses in 2016 let me remind you, in the first quarter we will record as normal approximately $1 billion in cost for retirement eligible incentives.
These results reflect good operating leverage on increased customer activities.
Expenses declined 2% from Q4 2014 as the savings from reduction in financial centers and personnel more than offset higher product costs and investment in increased sales specialists.
U.S. card credit quality was strong as net charge-offs remained at decades low levels of 2.5% with risk adjusted margin of 9.4%.
Investment in client facing professionals continues while lower revenue caused a decline in incentive compensations that was more than offset by amortization of stock awards issued in prior periods.
Global markets earned approximately $200 million but we think one should consider results excluding DVA.
Compared to Q4 last year FICC sales and trading of $1.8 billion improved 20% reflecting improvements across most products notably in rates and credit related products.
Equity trading of $822 million declined 3% reflecting lower client activity.
[Operator Instructions] WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our first question from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
As you know, I think weÃ¢ÂÂve been talking about maintaining core expenses below $13 million.
Hey, good morning may be just a quick question on deposit behavior since the rate high, have you seen anything unusual I would assume will be more in the institutional side where youÃ¢ÂÂve seen movement at this point and then maybe you can kindly give some update on how youÃ¢ÂÂre thinking about the deposit data this year?
",51.55,0.7806216
boa,q1,2016,"We cut the number of legal entities in half and we also reduced costs through programs like New BAC that produced a loan more than $8 billion in annual savings and our SIM program which continues to operate today.
Long-term debt has been cut dramatically; deposits have increased over 20% and most of that growth is coming through our Consumer Banking and Wealth Management segments.
These earnings include the negative impact of the FAS 91 market-related adjustment, which reduced EPS by $0.07.
Before moving to the balance sheet I want to note an adjustment to the financial statements this quarter, reclassifying some operating leases.
And note that the first quarter included the $8.5 billion settlement payment to Bank of New York Mellon as trustee in the article 77 suit, which was reserved for over four years ago.
Loans outside the primary lending segments in LAS and All Other were down $10 billion from Q4 driven by continued pay downs of first and second lien mortgages as well as loan sales.
We had some immaterial movements this quarter from minor adjustments but overall very little change in consumer losses.
Commercial losses declined slightly from Q4 despite a slight increase in energy charge-offs.
While net charge-offs were flat, total reserve release declined as reserve releases in Consumer were mostly offset by reserve increases in commercial driven by energy exposures.
Consumer real estate charge-offs benefited from continued portfolio improvement and fewer one time items, primarily collateral valuation adjustments on consumer real estate.
Adjusting for those items, consumer net charge-offs were relatively flat versus Q4.
Moving to commercial credit on Slide 11, net charge-offs improved $35 million.
A decline in non-energy net charge-offs from Q4 more than offset a modest increase in energy losses.
Looking at our $7.7 billion utilized exposure to the higher risk E&P and oilfield services clients, we saw a decline of $600 million from Q4 as payoffs and charge-offs more than offset draw downs.
Included in NII this quarter was a FAS 91 negative $1.2 billion market-related adjustment for bond premium amortization.
About 40% of this estimated $6 billion increase comes from short end rate improvement and the rest is from long end rate improvement split equally between FAS 91 and reinvestment at higher rates.
First quarter expense also included FAS 123 annual retirement costs of $850 million, slightly below Q1 2015.
First quarter of both years also included about $300 million of seasonally elevated payroll tax expense.
Adjusting for all these items, i.e. This decline of $600 million from Q1 2015 was driven by: lower revenue-related costs associated with sales and trading in investment banking, as well as revenue in our Wealth Management business; the roll off of advisory retention awards put in place after the combination with Merrill Lynch; and lastly, SIM initiatives that are improving productivity and helping us lower costs so that we can continue to invest in growth.
These earnings reflect continued core customer growth coupled with strong expense management.
Lower provision expense from continued improvement in asset quality also benefited the bottom line.
Revenue increased $242 million or 3% from Q1 2015 as NII growth more than offset lower non-interest income.
Non-interest income was down due to lower mortgage banking income offset by increases in card income and service charges.
Focusing on Mobile Banking users in the upper right for a minute, we added 910,000 net new mobile users this quarter.
As weÃ¢ÂÂve discussed many times and shown here, we are originating high FICO loans that have produced very low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted margins currently exceeding 9%.
Turning to Slide 17, Global Wealth & Investment Management produced earnings of $740 million, up 13% from Q1 2015.
Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q1 2015 as strong NII growth was more than offset by lower market sensitive revenue.
Long-term AUM flows were down this quarter as a result of market volatility which impacted client behavior.
Average deposits grew $9 billion from Q4 and average loans also grew this quarter concentrated in consumer real estate lending.
Turning to Slide 19, Global Banking earned $1.1 billion, down from both comparative periods as energy reserves weighed on results.
Despite this increased provision expense, Global Banking was able to deliver a 12% return on allocated capital.
Global Banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks and this drove a nice increase year-over-year in NII, mitigated to some degree by spread compression.
Looking at trends on Slide 20 and comparing to Q1 last year, it was obviously a tough quarter for the capital markets with spikes in volatility causing declines in client activity.
All of this resulted in Global Markets reporting earnings just under $1 billion.
The number of 60 plus day delinquent first mortgage loans serviced continue to decline and is now only 88,000 units.
Results were impacted by the $1.2 billion FAS 91 market-related adjustment, the FAS 123 seasonal retirement eligible incentive costs and litigation costs.
If one adjusts this periodÃ¢ÂÂs reported results for the noncash FAS 91 market-related NII amount and the FAS 123 costs, earnings are largely in line with recent quarters.
Just maybe letÃ¢ÂÂs focus Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂll focus my question on expenses and then IÃ¢ÂÂll get back in the queue.
Our next question comes from Matt OÃ¢ÂÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
And going back to I think Jim's question earlier, the cost structure keeps moving in your favor as you keep driving this activity through.
Even today I think there's about a quarter million checks a day, people take a picture of them and send them in on their mobile phones and that didn't exist three years ago.
40% of the $6 billion is going to come from an increase in short end rates and then the other 60% is split equally between FAS 91 and reinvestment at longer term rates.
So we test that question you're asking which is what happens if residual values or used car values continue to Ã¢ÂÂ fell dramatically in a recessionary environment or something and that's one of the things we test, and it's not a big number.
So where did all those expense savings go or is this going to come through in future quarters?
Look in terms we are focused on driving down expenses every day, every quarter, every week.
It will Ã¢ÂÂ in some cases you would hope that it wouldn't go up a lot because that would mean asset management fees and other things are growing, which attach more compensation, less marginal profit, which will be good news, because the overall profit will grow better.
Brian, I think weÃ¢ÂÂve all over the last few years been trying to find banking normal and itÃ¢ÂÂs proving hard to find.
When you think about revenue, net interest income, excluding that bond premium adjustment, was $10.6 billion this quarter.
Of note, the downdraft in that was driven by Capital Markets and related activities and, to a lesser degree, mortgage servicing and other fees as we continue to wind down our third-party servicing book.
And if you focus just on the core costs excluding our LAS and litigation, those were down $600 million quarter Ã¢ÂÂ from first quarter of last year or $2.4 billion annualized.
Turning to Slide 3 and looking at the business segment earnings, you can see the good year-over-year results because of the operating leverage in those businesses.
Moving to Slide 4, during the period of Ã¢ÂÂ during the first quarter, there was a lot of talk with the market volatility, the Company buying surrounding the question about global growth and the forward-looking economic picture.
When you think about this, itÃ¢ÂÂs important to remember the work weÃ¢ÂÂve done over the past years to simplify and strengthen our foundation.
$3 billion in technology-related growth initiatives, especially in areas of digital practice, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs in Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, where we lead the industry with mobile and online platforms.
We intend to keep driving the core customer activity you see on the loan and deposit and customer flow growth in each and every business, focusing intently on the Wealth Management and Global Markets businesses to take advantage as markets have stabilized.
Expenses were $14.8 billion, approximately $1 billion or 6% lower than a year ago, driven by good discipline across the entire Company.
Okay, moving to Slide 16, this is a new page that presents some statistics around loan growth and the quality of originations in our Consumer segment.
Moving to Slide 18, despite lower market levels, we continued to see overall solid client engagement and we continue to invest in the business, growing client facing professionals year-over-year.
That NII improvement, combined with revenue growth from credit cards and treasury fees, partially offset a decline in investment banking and other marks on loans and hedges.
With $167 billion in tangible common equity, $12 billion in credit reserves and twice the amount of liquidity of a few years ago, we believe we are well prepared to help customers and clients in good and bad times and we are focused on growing earnings in many different economic scenarios.
Jim, I think thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot more to do here because at the end of the day adjusting the efficiency ratio for the two major adjustments, which wonÃ¢ÂÂt reoccur next quarter, you get in the mid-60 Ã¢ÂÂ 66, 67 and we need to drive that down in the low 60s even with the realities of the wealth management business not being as profitable and a big part of our revenue stream but very return on capital beneficial.
And so that digitization, which is Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂre at $19.6 million, Mobile Banking consumer customers.
We thought weÃ¢ÂÂd got it into the low 2s Ã¢ÂÂ 220, 240, and thought that was pretty good and now weÃ¢ÂÂre at 170, and my guess is we continue to push it down.
And so, we've absorbed a lot of that into the run rate and I think we're now to the point of fine-tuning the Company around the rules and regulations and continue optimizing it.
And then we've got obviously, as you spoke about, the continuation of finishing up the resolution plan, which we Ã¢ÂÂ has probably spent at least $0.5 billion on external parties to help us with and a lot of internal work.
And I think you can really see, when you look at those results, how much we've improved the credit quality of Company of both Ã¢ÂÂ across both Consumer and Commercial.
Do you think that can help in the buyback ask as you go through Ã¢ÂÂ it's not just a question about this year but just over time?
So there's opportunities for growth and that's Ã¢ÂÂ on the Consumer segment a lot of questions we get is how can you grow and keep your credit discipline?
When you flip it to the other side of it, yes, our job from the management team was to set this Company up to Ã¢ÂÂ it would never have the kind of risk embedded in it that would lead us to difficult times and a real recession, leave alone the CCAR analysis.
And if you think about in the Commercial book, it's Ã¢ÂÂ things like commercial real estate, we have been very disciplined and what we inherited through all the deals and development loans Ã¢ÂÂ all that stuff is really nonexistent at any consequence, so we feel very good about the Commercial book.
And then as I said earlier, Betsy, and you've followed our Company for a long time, you might Ã¢ÂÂ you would've seen a plateauing in the online Ã¢ÂÂ the computer-based banking, for lack of a better term, people coming in through BankofAmerica.com.
And if you look at the activity in the core customer base from card usage Ã¢ÂÂ both that in credit card usage up 4%-plus year-over-year, and that's good.
And you're absolutely right, driving all that out Ã¢ÂÂ near as we can tell, we spend about $1 billion a year just moving cash around in our company.
I was wondering about Ã¢ÂÂ on the net interest income side if you could talk a little bit about, Paul, what kind of outlook we should think about for the core net interest income.
But I think as you head to the third quarter and fourth quarter, when you consider what we're Ã¢ÂÂ think we can do on deposit growth and loan growth, and if rates follow the path along the forward curve, we would expect to make progress in the latter half of the year.
No, I wouldn't say Ã¢ÂÂ look, I think you heard from competitors that Asia was a little better in March.
Look, if you think about our ROA and you adjust for FAS 91 market-related NII adjustments and retirement-eligible expenses, you're going to get into the mid-70s.
Yes, it's Ã¢ÂÂ they are working on all the elements expense, so you've got that right.
So that's one of the operating leverage points in wealth management that we were losing a lot last year that we're going to get back as short-term rates rise because they are a heavy deposit business.
So really you still have modifications that Ã¢ÂÂ the re-modification work going on because people have had modifications for years.
Well, as we've told you, our target Ã¢ÂÂ our next weigh station on improving this thing is $500 million at the end of the year and we're well on our way to get there, Paul.
And so what we've got to execute on Ã¢ÂÂ it's not going to have the impact of when we had $3.1 billion of quarterly costs a few years.
But we're just Ã¢ÂÂ like I said earlier to Betsy on the Consumer side, we've got to keep moving this in the right direction and we have an idea where we'll get to, but we want to make sure we get the first piece out, it's $1 billion a year.
We've made, I think Ã¢ÂÂ so the key is we've got to continue to make progress on expenses and, again, I think we've demonstrated that we can do that.
We've got a lot of focus on this and I think you're going to continue to see progress.
I just want to get a sense as to whether we should be thinking about that 26% margin that we saw in the quarter as a good jumping off point, just given some of the tailwinds you had spoken to, whether it be the higher-margin NII growth and the absence of the legacy Merrill awards.
And as we think about the expense trajectory for this business, what should we expect in an environment where the trading revenues are relatively stable or consistent with what we saw in the most recent quarter?
I think we were disciplined this quarter in terms of our compensation expense and you saw that in the numbers.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been adjusting as you read about in the press, there is a Ã¢ÂÂ it's not in the run rate yet, it comes in next quarter because it happened mid-March.
I think the simple thing to think about in the investment banking Capital Market side is the work is ready to go, we just Ã¢ÂÂ if we continue to see the stability, you will see it come through.
I think itÃ¢ÂÂs just a question, as Brian said, of CEOs and Boards just making sure that the stability weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing right now is something that they can count on as they go to market.
So there are a lot of quarters where the core activity was growing but you couldnÃ¢ÂÂt find it because Ã¢ÂÂ if you look at the slide you can see the All Other, which is the investment portfolio, really mortgages and then the LAS assets are now small enough so that the quarter-to-quarter runoff.
So Ã¢ÂÂ but the core business is growing faster and then weÃ¢ÂÂre still running off, but weÃ¢ÂÂve told people to focus in at that level.
IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure you can consider first-quarter banking normal in the sense that we still have extra costs weÃ¢ÂÂve got a get out of here, Nancy, that we continue to work down.
And so, if you Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂve taken the balance sheet from implying at the time of Merrill, probably nearly to $800 billion or more, maybe closer to $1 trillion down to $500 billion and the revenues have stabilized and I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a good place for us to be.
So, we look at how we pare away things and look at it Ã¢ÂÂ so in the international business weÃ¢ÂÂve pared back Ã¢ÂÂ there was 1,200 Ã¢ÂÂ I donÃ¢ÂÂt know, 800 to 1,200 people that were downsized in markets and banking in the first quarter.
We continue to look at it, but right now we really like the franchise and the connectivity between the franchise of all the different elements, focused on markets, focused on wealth management, focused on the core business.
And I think now the question is with low rates, we just have to grind the cost down and thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to come out of really all the pieces and Ã¢ÂÂ well, for a while, it was Ã¢ÂÂ you could go at it at a fairly high level and drive it.
Improvement of core costs of $2 billion run rate first quarter last year to first quarter this year is not Ã¢ÂÂ is working at it.
So what weÃ¢ÂÂre actually Ã¢ÂÂ if you think about it as a real estate question, the number is not as important as they are full and that they are marginally driving the profit.
I wanted to focus on mortgage banking and the retention of those loans, more on the balance sheet than continuing to push them to the GSIBs. Is that regulatory driven or are you really looking for that higher retention rate because youÃ¢ÂÂre looking for some assets that have duration, so is that one of the better maybe option adjusted yields that you can get at this point?
And again, look Ã¢ÂÂ the facts are weÃ¢ÂÂve been growing overall, so year-over-year including those segments which, as you point off by our strategy are running off faster.
And I just wanted to understand did you have to do anything to build for that book of business or is this already something thatÃ¢ÂÂs in your run rate on the expense side and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be bringing in incremental revenues on the mortgage servicing side?
",58.15,0.6926387
boa,q2,2016,"Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements.
This quarter included negative market related NII adjustments that cost $0.05 per share and negative DVA that cost us another penny for a total of $0.06.
For example, this quarter we crossed over 20 million active mobile users and continued to increase their use of digital channels for both transactions and buying more bank products.
Active mobile banking customers logged into their accounts over 900 million times this quarter, depositing more than 25 million checks, with more than 20 million via mobile check deposits.
Global Markets generated $3.7 billion in sales and trading revenue excluding DVA.
Not only have net charge-offs not gotten worse, but they have improved in the most recent quarter moving back below $1 billion.
Consumer banking continue its momentum around client activity and operating leverage.
Under the advanced approaches compared to Q1 2016, the CET 1 ratio increased seven basis points to 10.5% and is above our current 2019 requirement.
RWA declined roughly 13 billion, driven by reductions related to retail exposures primarily from credit improvement.
The commercial net charge-off ratio excluding small business has been below 15 basis points for 14 consecutive quarters, even with the elevated levels of energy charge-offs we experienced over the past three quarters.
Looking forward to Q3, we will benefit from an extra day which will be offset by the impact of declines in long end rates over the past two quarters and put pressure on our MBS bond yields and reinvestment yields more generally.
Having said that, we made steady progress on reducing legacy loan servicing costs this quarter and we still expect to achieve our original goal of lowering the former LAS segment costs ex-litigation to $500 million in Q4.
As an example, I would note that our growth to mobile banking continues to play an important role in helping us optimize our delivery network while improving customer satisfaction.
Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, Merrill Lynch broker assets at $132 billion or up 8% versus Q2 2015 on strong account flows partially offset by lower market valuations.
Average vehicle loans are up 20% from Q2 2015 with average booked FICO scores remaining well above the 770 level and net losses remaining below 30 basis points and improving on a linked quarter basis.
As we viewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high FICO loans which generally produce low loss rates and strong risk adjusted margins.
This quarter included a modest gain from the previously announced sale of Bank of America Global Capital Management.
Double-digit percent revenue growth year-over-year offset a low single digit expense growth creating strong operating leverage that improved the efficiency ratio to 45%.
Global banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks producing solid year-over-year improvement in NII.
Customers and clients were able to live their financial lives better in Q2 because global markets delivered for them under challenging market conditions, helping them raise capital, buy and sell securities, as well as manage risk.
Excluding DVA and versus Q2 2015, FICC sales and trading of $2.6 billion increased 22% as the improvement which began in late Q1 continued through Q2 as global concerns abated and central banks took further monetary policy actions.
Equity sales and trading was $1.1 billion, declining 8% versus Q2 2015 which saw significant client activity in Asia driven by stock market rallies in the region.
We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and continuing to deploy technology that improves customer satisfaction.
WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our first question from Matt OÃ¢ÂÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve worked I think extraordinarily hard to transform the company, its balance sheet, its ability to produce earnings.
And while people always ask the question you ask, the answer is thereÃ¢ÂÂs still about seven out of 10 mortgage customers at Bank of America get their mortgage somewhere else that fit within our credit customers.
Maybe if you could help us think through Ã¢ÂÂ you talked about near-term kind of flattish, but as we think a little bit longer term, if the forward curve is realized and/or maybe give some color.
Whatever deposit growth doesnÃ¢ÂÂt get absorbed by good loans with our clients obviously goes into the investment portfolio and we get a return there.
So I think your point about what give us encouragement because you saw it last year second quarter, this year second quarter about how even in a lower for longer rate environment we can grow NII is that youÃ¢ÂÂre actually are growing the net loan book pretty consistently now each quarter.
WeÃ¢ÂÂll take the next question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
So right now thatÃ¢ÂÂs around 75-ish percent of the loans weÃ¢ÂÂre originating are going on our balance sheet.
Hi. I apologize for going back to the net interest income issue, but obviously the reason why central banks keep interest rates down is because they expect it to increase lending.
We reported solid earnings of $4.2 billion after tax, or $0.36 per diluted share, in what was certainly an eventful quarter for the markets from an overall macro perspective.
At BAC, we focus on what we can control, and despite low rates and other macro events, we continue to focus on managing our risk, our costs and our delivery of quality products and customer service.
We can do that by continued success on things like expense management, by keeping NII stable to growing, stable and growing fees, and continue to manage risk well and hold down our credit costs.
However, in summary, adjusted for market-related changes in both last yearÃ¢ÂÂs second quarter and this yearÃ¢ÂÂs second quarter, we grew NII by 400 million or 4% year-over-year.
Going forward in a stable interest rate environment, we believe we can maintain NII around the second quarter 2016 level based on the current loan and deposit growth we see.
Sales and trading revenue including DVA for this quarter is the highest second quarter we have experienced in five years and it led to one of the most profitable quarters for Global Markets we have seen in the past five years.
Both those impacted both card fees and banking service charges and you can see them coming off the bottom as you look at the linked quarters.
Our mortgage business is now sized appropriately for our franchise and the fee line there Paul will talk about later, but will be as that near where itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be in the future.
But the important thing is we have strong businesses, strong client-facing businesses in these areas and weÃ¢ÂÂre getting our share of these revenue streams even while the markets ebbs and flows.
This continues a trend of performance that has shown expense declining significantly on a quarterly basis quarter-after-quarter over the past several years.
As we look out from the second Ã¢ÂÂ the third quarter of 2016 through the next six quarters into 2018, we believe that with our SIM efforts and the continued work weÃ¢ÂÂre doing across the board on expenses, weÃ¢ÂÂre targeting an annual expense number of around $53 billion in total expenses for the year 2018.
So over six quarters we continue to absorb investment, merit increases, rising healthcare costs, and bring the expenses down a nominal amount.
Our continued work in driving down costs to service delinquent loans will help with this, but the other reductions are generally coming from the core work and simplified improved.
But what I want to get to across to you is LAS as an operational segment successfully did what it was tasked to do: to clean up one of the largest mortgage servicing businesses in the U.S. From 1.4 million delinquent mortgage loans weÃ¢ÂÂre down to 80,000 a day.
Our global banking team drove results with continued solid loan growth, operating leverage of 9% and strong credit results.
So on a combined basis, those four business segments improved 16% from last yearÃ¢ÂÂs second quarter earning about $5 billion this quarter.
As you know, when general deposit flows drive the size of our balance sheet, and they on a lending basis were relatively flat this quarter as inflows were partially offset by outflows to fund seasonal tax payments.
Again, on an average basis year-over-year, loans and all other were driven by 42 billion driven by continued runoff of first and second main mortgages while loans in our Business segments were up 65 billion or 9%.
Broad-based growth was led by consumer, increasing more than 44 billion or 8% year over year, while wealth management deposits grew 6% and deposits with corporate clients and global banking improved nearly 4%.
Compared to Q2 2015, results were up nearly $400 million, or 4%, as higher short end rates combined with loan growth funded by deposits offset the negative impact of lower long end rates.
If we have stability in long end rates, we would expect to maintain that level in the near-term, again, assuming modest loan and deposit growth.
Rates moving up or down from here would obviously impact that perspective slightly in the near-term, but building as we extend that scenario into future quarters and years.
Turning to slide 11, noninterest expense was $13.5 billion in the quarter.
As the employee base continues to go lower, we think itÃ¢ÂÂs important to point out that the reductions on a percentage basis now include more highly paid managerial associates.
Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 12, consumer earned $1.7 billion, continuing its trend of solid improvement and reporting a robust 20% return on allocated capital.
Revenue and earnings were driven by deposit and loan growth coupled with continued expense improvement driving operating leverage.
As a result of this operating leverage, the efficient ratio improved roughly 360 basis points year-over-year.
The adoption and popularity of these capabilities continues to drive growth with record volume of $246 billion this quarter, up nearly 5% year-over-year.
Asset management revenues declined from Q2 2015 on lower market values while improving modestly on a linked-quarter basis.
Client balances at $2.4 trillion were down from Q1; but excluding the sale I mentioned earlier were up from Q1, as higher market valuation levels, $10 billion of long-term AUM flows and loan growth more than offset tax-related deposit outflows.
Global Banking earned $1.5 billion, producing solid improvement over both Q1 and year-over-year.
Looking at trends on page 18, and comparing Q2 last year, clients were comforted Ã¢ÂÂ excuse me, clients were confronted with increased volatility once again this quarter, with concerns around both global growth as well as the outcome of the U.K. referendum.
Switching to global markets on slide 19, the past couple of quarters are great examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world but also to our customers and clients in all our business segments.
In terms of revenue, this was the best second quarter we have had in the past five years.
But what we saw is that people were not sort of getting the expenses right in the out years thinking that we could not continue the rate of investment and continue to bring down expenses.
So I think it was consistent with the way weÃ¢ÂÂre running the company but we want to make sure that people had clarity over the next six quarters and going into 2018 of where we think the expense base goes versus what we saw in some of your guysÃ¢ÂÂ estimates and stuff.
Look, as I said in my comments, if rate follow the current path of the forward curve, we would expect with the extra day and the client long-term rates to be at around a $10.4 billion range in the next quarter.
So I think, look, itÃ¢ÂÂs just a question of the further you get out, the more that wave of deposits and asset growth kind of overwhelms the change in interest rates and we see growth.
Also if you look at page six, you can see that Ã¢ÂÂ a point you made is that the inflection point was hit a few quarters ago where the sort of the non-core loans and leases were running down and not being made up by growth.
But think about it as second quarter next year, youÃ¢ÂÂd start to see this breakthrough again, based on absolutely no change in rates from the low point they were.
But weÃ¢ÂÂre continuing to see declines year-over-year in card income, service charges and the brokerage business.
I think card actually is up on a linked-quarter basis, down year-over-year.
But I think over time as Ã¢ÂÂ if capital markets continue to rise, we will get Ã¢ÂÂ we will offset that decline in transactional revenue.
Admittedly itÃ¢ÂÂs a little tricky, because the actual rules only apply to the $200-odd billion of 401(NYSE:K) and retirement assets we have, but itÃ¢ÂÂs consistent with where weÃ¢ÂÂre taking the business and the team drawing we donÃ¢ÂÂt see meaningful revenue or changes due to that.
But the idea is we are going to take expenses from $56 billion in the last four quarters to $53 billion and we think thatÃ¢ÂÂs where weÃ¢ÂÂll get them to.
And I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to take away Ã¢ÂÂ I think we collectively appreciate having a 2018 expense target, but if you just take the second quarter annualized, youÃ¢ÂÂre at $54 billion, and then if you reduce your LAS expenses, you kind of get down to a $53 billion number.
Moved into the segments whether itÃ¢ÂÂs consumer, U.S. trust, or Merrill Lynch are the loans that relate to their businesses in terms of servicing costs, too.
I guess I was just Ã¢ÂÂ so youÃ¢ÂÂre saying that first of all on legal, the 53 billion includes roughly 300 million per quarter rate, and that your operating assumption for the GWIM and other market business would assume a revenue inflation and corresponding payout inflation from those businesses from here?
So if servicing is running off and not being replaced as fast, if weÃ¢ÂÂre holding more mortgages on the balance sheet as we transition from MBI to NII you could see that line continues sort of trend lower.
I think that trend lower is going to be, you know, in some quarters very slow because as you point out other items Ã¢ÂÂ other line items are a little bit messy and bounce around there depending on what happens with interest rates.
And despite both of those circumstances, we think in the out years we can grow NII or in the out quarters we can grow NII because weÃ¢ÂÂre growing deposits, and weÃ¢ÂÂre putting them to work where we can within our risk and client frameworks to grow well priced loans.
Brian has already pointed out all the work weÃ¢ÂÂre doing around expenses, so when you combine what we think we can do from a fee base, from an NII perspective and lowering expenses, we think we can grow earnings of a company even if interest rates are flat.
",49.89,0.791832
boa,q3,2016,"One thing before Brian and Paul get into the results, I just want to remind you we file an 8-K on October 4, giving notification the company changed our method of accounting for the amortization of premium and accretion of discounts related to certain debt securities known by the investment community as FAS 91.
We reported earnings of $5 billion or $0.41 per diluted share and EPS improvement of 8% from the year ago quarter.
Another question we get asked is, what can we do to drive earnings even if we stay in this low rate, low growth environment?
RWA declined roughly 20 billion, driven by reductions in global markets exposures and improvements in credit quality, driven by run-off of non-core legacy exposure.
Turning to asset quality on slide 7, we believe a number of factors including our strategy of responsible growth, enhanced underwriting standards since 2008, and a healthier economy have transformed the risk profile of Bank of America, as we look forward to future economic cycles.
Compared to Q3; Ã¢ÂÂ15, NII is up 3 million or 3%, as loan growth are shorter than rates and higher security balances funded by deposits more than offset the negative impact of generally lower long-end rates over the past several quarters.
Okay with respect to assets sensitivity as of 9/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by 5.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months.
Consumer earned 1.8 billion continuing its trend of solid results and reporting a robust 21% return on allocated capital.
Excluding those prior period gains, revenue improved year-over-year and growth in pre-tax, pre-provisioned earnings was even more substantial.
Looking a little closer at revenue drivers compared to Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15, net interest income continue to improve as we drove deposits higher.
Focusing on client balances on the left, in addition to deposit growth, Merrill Edge brokers assets at a 138 billion are up 18% versus Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15 on strong account flows and market valuations.
As we viewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high FICO score loans, which have generally produced low loss rates and strong risk adjusted returns.
Loan growth included consumer real estate production of 20.4 billion, up 21% from Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15 and in line with Q2 Ã¢ÂÂ16 as customers continue to take advantage of historically low interest rates.
NII benefitted from solid loan and deposit growth, non-interest income declined from Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15,driven lower transactional revenue that continues to be impacted by market factors as well as migration of activities from brokerage to managed relationships.
Moving to slide 16; we continue to see overall solid client engagement, client balances approached 2.5 trillion and are up from Q2 including higher market valuations, 10 billion of long term AUM flows and continued loan and deposit growth.
Clients can invest online, completely self-directed through Merrill Edge or if they are interested in enhanced professional portfolio management, they will be able to use Merrill Edge guided investing, or they can chose fully advised working one-on-one with the financial advisor via brokerage or fee based advisory platforms.
Return on allocated capital was 17%, a 300 basis points improvement from Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15, despite adding a couple of billion dollars of allocated capital this year.
Global banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks producing solid year-over-year improvement at NII.
Revenue growth also benefited from roughly a 175 million from gains on [NPL] this quarter versus loses in Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15.
Again this quarter, global markets delivered for clients by helping them raise capital, buying self-securities, as well as manage risk.
Excluding DVA and versus Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15, FICC sales and trading of 2.8 billion increased 39% as we built momentum as the quarter progressed across a host of credit products and continued gains in rates products.
Equity sales and trading were solid at $1 billion in revenue, but declined 17% versus Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15, which benefitted from higher levels of market volatility and client activity.
A loss in the current period compares to earnings of a 152 million in Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15 as lower security gains and higher expense litigation offset higher mortgage banking revenue.
MBI revenue this quarter includes 280 million benefits from higher valuations on our MSR driven by slower expected prepaid speeds based upon recent observed trends and customer behavior.
We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and deploying technology that helps the customers better live their financial lives and improves satisfaction.
Just wanted to ask about expenses, could you talk about what kind of timing expectations you have under various projects helping to drive down your expenses further in 2017 and Ã¢ÂÂ18, maybe just remind us what are some of the big items that youÃ¢ÂÂre working on and should we still think about 53 billion in 2018 as kind of your hard target that youÃ¢ÂÂre shooting for.
And I would also just point out to remind everybody that if you look at expenses over a longer term, we reduced quarterly expenses ex litigation by 4.8 billion from Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ11, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a 19 billion run rate.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre seeing good momentum with more than 21 million mobile banking active users and thatÃ¢ÂÂs growing every week, every month.
Just curious for point of clarification, Brian had mentioned global markets, feels like itÃ¢ÂÂs taken a little share.
And that drop came again from legacy portfolios running off, and from a continued work by our goal markets team to better manage their balance sheet relevant to those ratios.
I think youÃ¢ÂÂre noticing some modest card balance growth in the quarter, which we think will continue as we add new accounts and again weÃ¢ÂÂre very focused on adding high quality accounts there.
I think you probably also noticed that while combined debit and credit card spend was good in the quarter at 5%, 6% of it could fuel, IÃ¢ÂÂm adjusting for our divestitures last year that the growth in the card camp was impacted by customer reward programs.
However just focusing on the fee income, this is some really key benefits of our strategy which is a track relatively higher quality card customers reward them for deepening their overall relationship with us.
This strategy really drives deposit growth and makes deposits stickier, plus we believe these customers have little loss rates, they used to (inaudible) which helps us lower cost.
The answer is, I think you said weÃ¢ÂÂll follow the customers and I donÃ¢ÂÂt know the exact number because I can tell you, eight years ago when we had 6100, there were people who said there was never going to be less branches in our system and maybe we should add more and guess what weÃ¢ÂÂre 4500.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to value and youÃ¢ÂÂve got to be continually looking at that valuation and we thought it was time based upon observation of pre-payment speeds to make a change in some key assumptions.
But just to be clear, are you expecting improving, stable or deteriorating ROA based on the current competitive environment, because it seems like many peers are underscoring the near-term risks to profitability from awards and customer acquisition costs?
Again weÃ¢ÂÂre focused on prime and super prime, so originations were down modestly Q3 versus the prior quarter as we accepted a little bit less dealer flow, but we still feel good about that product offering.
I was hoping you can give us an update as to what portion of Merrill client assets are currently in brokerage IRA, and maybe more specifically, how should we think about the net economic impact from transitioning some of those retirement assets into some of the other offerings that you highlighted, whether it be fee-based which should generate higher fees versus robo or self-directed Merrill Edge?
Okay well that looked like obviously a technical question and itÃ¢ÂÂs not that we havenÃ¢ÂÂt thought about it, but to be frank, itsÃ¢ÂÂ just a speech at this point and he didnÃ¢ÂÂt really address that in his speech.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs not a quarter that when you look across four or five years that we havenÃ¢ÂÂt come close to on many cases and have done better than a few times.
I guess given relative to your $53 billion cost target for 2018 and the fact that the negotiations seem to be starting to gear up early next year, how youÃ¢ÂÂre thinking about the costs in the global markets and global banking businesses from Brexit if it ends up being a harder Brexit than a softer Brexit?
Couple of questions, Paul, your deposits at the Fed declined pretty sharply almost 20% linked quarter, even though you had deposit growth and given that long-term rates are still very low.
We continue to drive responsible growth and deliver more of the companyÃ¢ÂÂs capabilities to our clients and customers.
You can also see this in the growth of our Merrill Edge brokerage balances, which now total over $138 billion, adding investment relationships to the mass market customer base.
Our global wealth and investment management teams, US Trust and Merrill Lynch not only manage $2 trillion plus in investment balances, but also manage nearly $150 billion in loans and more than $250 billion in deposits, and we continue to see net flows of core assets in that business.
And then with our global peers restructuring, including in the markets business, I think this quarter is another great example of how global markets business is important to our investing and issuing clients.
We better client activity driving the best third quarter results weÃ¢ÂÂve had in the five years in investment banking and in sales and trading, and we are doing that with a smaller balance sheet, fewer people, and lower value at risk or VAR.
This is driven by changes we made right after the crisis, thinking 2008 and 2009 and the long term benefits of that effort continue to come through.
These deposits are growing because our capabilities in the business are the best in the industry and our customers and clients see that.
Our simplified and improved initiatives continue to help drive those costs down, and that leads to the question we also get asked.
So as we look forward, we are driving responsible growth and maintaining discipline on cost, and this has allowed us to deliver more capital back to you, and weÃ¢ÂÂll keep on doing that.
While the overall headcount is down, itÃ¢ÂÂs important to note that year-over-year we added over 1,000 primary sales associates across consumer, wealth management and global banking.
Average deposits continued their strong growth up 50 billion or 9% year-over-year, outpacing the industry.
We grew revenue, we grew deposits, we grew loans, we delivered for clients in capital markets, we lowered costs.
So if you think about what we have to do between and 2018, I think we talked about this before, roughly a third of that is going to come from continued progress on delinquent loan servicing.
As I said, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue to make progress on delinquent loan servicing cost, hopefully see some modest improvement on litigation.
What we know is client activity was up in the third quarter and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what drives our short term results.
So, in some of those, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to look a little bit different than some of our competitors in some places, but we feel good.
Betsy if you go to page six of the materials you can see that weÃ¢ÂÂre continuing in the mortgage area overall, so thinks both in home equity and first mortgage loan.
You can see that we continue to run off some of that non-core portfolio and overall the balances grow in the business segment, and we expect that to continue.
I think if you think about the growth, youÃ¢ÂÂve got the side and youÃ¢ÂÂve got the fee side and if you think about the interest side itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be driven by balanced growth between loans and deposits, and I think we keep growing deposits every year $60 billion weÃ¢ÂÂre paying four basis points in consumer and think about that dynamic and putting that to work in anything we can is important, and we continue to grow loans at less rate than we grow (inaudible).
If thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to drive our NIM, itÃ¢ÂÂs just a bigger and bigger, lower and lower cost deposit base.
And on the loan side, I think consumers growing better now than commercial in linked quarter, but overall we expect commercial will get back in a little bit as the economy continues and some of the uncertainty listed in the political season here.
On the fee side, what youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing is the dynamic and its specially fee areas finally turn a little bit stable and then turning for us in the card revenue and things like that, which would hit sort of the inflexion point where the run down and relative interchange due to selling some portfolios and getting out of non-core portfolios and putting on the core portfolios with rewards attached to which helps us generate deposit and things like that is stabilizing and starting to see in the last few quarters, card income starting to move up a bit.
Maybe you could talk a little bit about the credit cycle, I think one of the major pushback from investors is that weÃ¢ÂÂre going to start to see credit at worse.
I think I said it earlier, if you think about the last several quarters of earnings call, itÃ¢ÂÂs not going to get any better than this and every quarter it gets slightly better and that in part is because weÃ¢ÂÂre still getting the benefits of the changes made six, seven, eight years ago coming through the consumer business i.e. that what we call back book portfolios or legacy portfolios or whatever word you want to use continue to run-off with higher credit risk and we keep putting and have put on and continue to put on higher credit quality.
So if you think about overall charge-offs of 880 this quarter, thatÃ¢ÂÂs driven by the consumer business and thatÃ¢ÂÂs driven by the card and some in legacy home equities.
And so keeping the card business where we wanted is critical and youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing us continue, even as we start to see that portfolio both nominally and rate the charge-off picture strong.
Yeah, thereÃ¢ÂÂs always more to do, and we are focused on a lot of different regulatory metrics, and weÃ¢ÂÂre looking at all of them where there are some maybe a little bit more important than others right now and we are focused on all of them.
Obviously as we grow balance sheet, as we grow loans and deposits, we are going to continue to see some increase particularly on the standardize side.
But I think people always have to remember, the reason why we have more is because our deposits grew at $60 billion year-over-year and thatÃ¢ÂÂs more than our loans grew by quite a bit.
So, I guess the question is, if we do get a rate increase, do you think youÃ¢ÂÂve got more flexibility to limit the possible pricing given its basically worked so far and loan growth has obviously not enough to absorb the deposit growth you have.
And if you think about that, and thereÃ¢ÂÂs a dominate by our consumer business and our non-interest bearing accounts and consumer have doubled in size over the last five or six years due to focusing on primary accounts in the house or where they run their household finances through our account and therefore the correct deposit are check and things like that.
So, the first thing the number are [1 trillion] to 450 non-interest bearing and a dominant part of that consumer and also in the wealth management, (inaudible) transactional count of both consumers and then on the business side similarly we have driven our deposits to be really LCR friendly and core operating accounts.
And then when you go to the second dynamic, remember with all those deposit growth, one of the things we continue to do and the impact less and less is we are expecting consumer business running off CD still at a fairly decent cliff that were historically used to fund prior companies, balance sheets that we donÃ¢ÂÂt need the funding that caused.
We feel very good about the consumer deposit base just cross 600 billion for the first time in the companyÃ¢ÂÂs history and consumers generally, and with that I think if rates rise, we think that it is substantial value for the company and Paul gave you what you think about that earlier with a quarter of 3.3 billion, 25% of 3.3 billion.
I think when you want to see the effect of this, you have to look at the overall consumer segment and whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on there in terms of growth of profits and improvement in expenses.
But the idea is just to grind up a slow and steady growth and weÃ¢ÂÂre starting to see that come through and largely it was massed in Ã¢ÂÂ14-Ã¢ÂÂ15 and behind that those areas, because we are divesting a lot non-core relationships and now we have synergy one and we have the core card business we wanted.
Do you think you can continue to hold does not improve the ROE as capital will likely continue to grow, presuming that you still will get those benefits going forward, and you are not at the point of returning more than 100% of your earnings yet?
ItÃ¢ÂÂs the core deposit account, the core credit card and getting it used in the core mortgage and the core home equity and the core auto loans thatÃ¢ÂÂs what weÃ¢ÂÂve been driving at and we continue to drive that and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the backbone of what we did and how we reposition this company over many years.
And the way to think about that optimization and why it is extremely important business to the company is that weÃ¢ÂÂve gone from 300 basis points the cost of all that to deposits to about 150 over the last 6-7 years and thatÃ¢ÂÂs by continuing to optimize the physical plan as well as all these other means.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre continuing to see good growth in consumer vehicle lending the way that we run the business.
You referenced some of the strategies you have in place driving responsible growth, and how you felt good about the business going forward.
Look I want to take just one step back, because to really answer that question you just have to have a better appreciation for how we run Bank of America, and it truly really does start with our purpose which is to help customers better live their financial lives and from there you have to understand what we mean responsible growth.
And if you look at the BRASS tax financials in to the third quarter of Ã¢ÂÂ16 we had $4.4 billion of revenue in our wealth management business.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre always the managing the trade-off between sort of liquidity, capital in terms of interest rate movements and returns and we just deployed some of that as I said in US treasuries because you can think about it going from one part of the government to the other.
And again I want to point out, weÃ¢ÂÂve done a lot of thinking about that, and we think maybe there is a near term impact on earnings but long term we think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a better strategy for our shareholders given the risk profile of the mortgages that were originating putting on the balance sheet.
And so weÃ¢ÂÂre earning all our money on the 7% and so when you think about the weighted average of that, it comes out over 10 and that means that youÃ¢ÂÂre in a lot more on the seven even across the whole company, and so thatÃ¢ÂÂs one of the difficulties.
Again less customers so the leverage is not quite the same and thatÃ¢ÂÂs why we spend a lot of our time around the consumer, and thereÃ¢ÂÂs just less leverage and the advisor you have to think about that business because the advisors are core strength that we have to the customer that we have to have an execution which is universal between the advisors and the customers, they can all see the same thing.

boa,q4,2016,"In improving economy, a relentless focus on client selection and growth through responsible lending combined to result in a historical low charge-off rate of 39 basis points for our company this quarter.
Consumer banking, our biggest earning business, continued its strong performance through its transformation, produced more than $7 billion in after-tax earnings, growing 8%.
Our global banking business serving our commercial customers continued to produce strong revenue and generated $5.7 billion of earnings.
And lastly, but not leastly, our global markets business earned $3.8 billion, the most itÃ¢ÂÂs earned in the past 5 years, with a rebound in sales and trading revenue and strong expense discipline on the part of the team.
As you know and you can see from the slides Paul walked through later, our business has important leadership positions across the board in their industry and we believe that they have room to grow their market shares by focus on deepening relationships with their existing customers as well as winning customers from the competition.
Turning to Slide 4, let me cover a few highlights in the fourth quarter before I turn it over to Paul, reported earnings of $4.7 billion after-tax at $0.40 per diluted share and EPS improvement of 48% from the year ago quarter on a reported basis.
We had a couple of pennies and net benefit this quarter from resolutions and tax matters that were partially offset by the combination of smaller charges for revenue, for debt hedge ineffectiveness, additions to our UK card ppi reserves we prepared for sale and DVA.
And with loan and deposit growth, we would expect NII to continue to improve from there throughout 2017 and beyond and Paul will take you through these numbers in a minute.
Their questions have ranged from corporate tax reform and what do we think about that, regulatory changes, economic growth and the impacts of these things and interest rate changes.
Again, the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year lower operating expenses and we have room to move them lower even as we continue a healthy investment across all our businesses.
Overall, the end of period assets declined $8 billion from Q3 as solid loan growth across our business segments was more than offset by lower levels of trading assets in our global markets business.
Driving the decline was a $4.7 billion reduction in the value of AFA securities held in our investment portfolio, which reduced in value as long-term rates rose significantly during the quarter.
Benefiting ratio was a $12 billion decline in RWA driven by lower exposures in our global markets business, partially offset by loan growth.
Turning to Slide 6, on an average basis, total loans are up $22 billion or 3% in Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15, versus Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ16 we saw pick up in growth driven by holiday spending on credit cards and some late quarter growth in commercial activity.
And on the bottom right chart, note the $64 billion in year-over-year growth in average deposits that Brian mentioned.
As you think about Q1 Ã¢ÂÂ17 versus Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ16, the benefit from the absence of negative market related ineffectiveness will be offset by two less days in the quarter, so you can effectively take this quarterÃ¢ÂÂs NII as a starting point.
Now assuming interest rates remain at current levels and we see modest loan and deposit growth, we believe we will earn approximately $600 million in additional NII in Q1, primarily driven by the Q4 rate increases in both the long and short end.
This business is generating above average deposit growth, solid loan growth, improving customer satisfaction and strong growth in earnings.
Consumer banking earned $1.9 billion and produced a 22% return on allocated capital this quarter.
Looking a little closer at revenue Ã¢ÂÂ excuse me, looking a little closer at the revenue drivers compared to Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15, while we report NII and non-interest revenue separately, it is important to emphasize again that our strategy is to focus on relationship deepening and growing total revenue, while improving operating leverage through expense discipline.
Average deposits continued their strong growth, up $54 billion or 10% year-over-year outpacing the industry.
Focusing on client balances on the left, in addition to deposit growth, client brokerage assets at $145 billion are up 18% versus Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15 on strong account flows and market valuations.
Turning to Slide 14, global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $634 million, which is up modestly from Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15 on solid operating leverage.
Relative to Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ16, we saw a pickup in lending, with average loans on a year-over-year basis up $19 billion or 6%.
Global markets earned $658 million and returned 7% on allocated capital in what is typically the most seasonally challenged quarter of the year.
For the year, the return on allocated capital was 10%, as sales and trading revenue ex-DVA grew 5%, while expense declined.
Paul, I was wondering if you could give us a little more split, some of the drivers of the net interest income increase that you are expecting to recur between the fourth and first quarter, the $600 million, how much is that is driven by the Fed hike we saw on the short end and how much of it might be the long end in rates versus loan growth?
Let me Ã¢ÂÂ maybe the simplest way to sort of answer that question would be to take you back to 9/30, right, when the inter-sensitivity on the long end was $2.1 billion.
In terms of next year, we will see what the scenarios are, the dollar caveats, but you are seen us constantly move our numbers up and we will continue to do that in our Ã¢ÂÂ our cushions and stuff are strong on the earnings, but the most important thing for us was kind of getting to make sure the earnings power of the company kept coming back and now with $17 billion earnings, we feel confident we will be able to push forward.
So when we think about going forward, what kind of deposit betas you are assuming in that $600 million per quarter and how do we think about the next rate hike, say we get one in June, which seems to be consensus, do you still expect to have very low positive betas from there?
And then the question on mortgage was, the production was good, but the pipeline fell a lot, obviously, a function of what happened in rates, but can you help us to think about what to expect, say, next year if say rates go up along the forward yield curve?
And so our view Ã¢ÂÂ the team would tell me that the pipeline will be down, because refinances are down and therefore expect less, but I think my view is that they should be able to continue to grow market share frankly because of the capacity that they were able to develop this year given those changes and still produce well.
So, we have told you, think about the mortgage banking income line as $300 odd million is a little higher this quarter just because some of the dynamics.
So, we are not Ã¢ÂÂ we feel great about it, but Ã¢ÂÂ and we think there is lots of opportunity and we would expect continued performance in that business.
But my guess is we are Ã¢ÂÂ our stress capital buffer is below the minimum that would be required, so we feel like we are in a good position for CCAR Ã¢ÂÂ17.
Deposits come in, thatÃ¢ÂÂs what really drives the size of the balance sheet, deposits come in, and the question is, within our risk framework, can we put those deposits to work with our customers and clients around the world?
And we Ã¢ÂÂ the duration of what we do on treasuries will be a little bit based on where we think rates are going and stuff like that, but itÃ¢ÂÂs driven Ã¢ÂÂ it just it goes in those two things because we have Ã¢ÂÂ once we fund the loan balance, thatÃ¢ÂÂs where it goes.
Other question was just on the improvement in the minimum capital ratio and the RWA reduction that drove that, could you just give us a little more color on the drivers there and do you feel like you are optimized now for what you want to take in terms of risk relative to total size balance sheet?
When you think about rate sensitivity in deposit betas, you get back to really deposit flows, we continued to see increases in deposit balances and until we see any pressure of those balances being kind of deployed back into the economy, there really shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be much impact on pricing, what is Ã¢ÂÂ you are looking at the core deposit balances and kind of what are the flows you are seeing and where is that growth coming from and are you seeing any pressure in a sense of thinking of those balances being deployed back into the economy?
In terms of deployment economy, we made $20 billion more loans, And we will continue to drive the economy and we can will invest in mortgage backed securities and things like that, so we are able to fund easily all the loan demand that we think is responsible to take on.
And loan growth in the middle market business was strong in the fourth quarter and we are looking forward for more of that in our small business.
Last quarter, we had I think some Ã¢ÂÂ that line is going to bounce around a little bit, let me start with that.
So there is certainly a lot of positives on this call, whether its deposits, loans, expenses, etcetera, but the end result, itÃ¢ÂÂs still a single digit return on equity, a return on tangible common equity and I know you wanted to be higher, I know itÃ¢ÂÂs improved, but itÃ¢ÂÂs still below your peers today at 13% and below your target of 10%, so can you give us a target metric for RoTCE for 2017 or when do you think you get to that double-digit range where some of your peers are?
And so just if you think about the middle-market business, as I said earlier, the revolver utilization is on the high end of where itÃ¢ÂÂs been the past several years at 40% plus in a Ã¢ÂÂ that group, which is our middle-market business, a commercial real estate business, etcetera, at about $4 billion with loans in quarter four, so all that really relates to greater business confidence.
Paul, just to think about that a second, that credit quality mortgages is so strong that frankly itÃ¢ÂÂs not worth getting the guarantees and things like that, we have the liquidity to fund them and itÃ¢ÂÂs obviously jumbos, but even on conforming, the credit quality of ours is at the top end and I think the charge-off ratio was 3 basis points in the fourth quarter.
No, thatÃ¢ÂÂs good question, but itÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ we transferred servicing at the end of the quarter.
So we feel very good about the growth in deposits year-over-year, 12% in checking and 10% overall, so itÃ¢ÂÂs coming from somewhere, I just donÃ¢ÂÂt know where exactly.
And then the other number thatÃ¢ÂÂs important is, at year end, our DTAs that would be re-priced if the tax rate changed equaled approximately $7 billion.
Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements.
We lowered our costs to improve productivity, with result in reduction expenses by almost 5% compared to 2015.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs nearly $3 billion in expense reductions continuing a long-term trend.
Note that this quarter had lower levels of non-core gains from equity, debt and asset sales than in past years.
Provision expense was modestly lower in the aggregate from fourth quarter Ã¢ÂÂ15 as our responsible growth strategy resulted in a 23% improvement in net charge-offs and we also had a lower amount of net reserves release from last yearÃ¢ÂÂs fourth quarter.
As these rate increases were late in the quarter, they didnÃ¢ÂÂt benefit the fourth quarter NII number thatÃ¢ÂÂs significant, but we look forward to first quarter Ã¢ÂÂ17 when we expect NII to all things remaining equal by approximately $600 million per quarter despite having 2 less days in that first quarter.
This dynamic bodes well as we expect growth and earnings from productivity improvements will now get the added benefits of rate increases.
Credit quality metrics remained strong, perhaps best symbolized by our net charge-off ratio which hit a record low of 39 basis points this quarter.
Our strong credit quality metrics are a manifestation of our overall risk management which has been transformed since 2008 and we expect our performance to bode well as we move through economic cycle.
Turning quickly to Slide 9, net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was 10.3 Ã¢ÂÂ $10.5 billion on an FTE basis.
Compared to Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15, NII this quarter was relatively stable after adding back the $612 million charge we incurred last year when we called some troughs securities.
Partially offsetting these benefits was market based hedge and effectiveness totaling $169 million related to the accounting for our long-term debt and associated swaps where we have swapped interest payments from fix to floating.
With respect to asset sensitivity as at 12/31 and instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates, it is estimated to increase NII by $3.4 billion over the subsequent 12 months.
Consumer continued to lower expenses and the efficiency ratio dropped nearly 500 basis points to 53% from Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15.
With good pricing discipline, prepaid on deposits remained a steady 4 basis points and the operating cost of deposits was also steady at 160 basis points.
Our relationship deepening is improving NII and balanced growth, while holding the fee line flat as we reward customers for doing more business with us.
However, the industry trend of increasing reward costs continues to mitigate our overall card revenue growth.
Turning to expenses in the upper right, they declined 7% in Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15 despite higher FDIC assessment charges between the two periods.
Loan growth reflected total consumer real estate production of $22 billion, up 29% from Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15 and 7% higher than Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ16 as the prior quarterÃ¢ÂÂs pipeline came through.
While these trends were important and continued to transform how consumers interact with us, I would remind you that we still have nearly 1 million people a day walking into our financial centers across the U.S. Many of these customers still use our branches to transact, but many also use the branch as a financial destination where they can learn more about products and services, work face-to-face with a specialized professional and generally improve their financial lives.
Year-over-year, non-interest income declined $104 million as higher asset management fees were more than offset by lower transactional revenue.
A 4% decline year-over-year on expenses drove 170 basis point improvement in operating leverage from Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15.
Other declines were the result of work across many categories of expense more than offsetting higher litigation and FDIC costs compared to last year.
Client balances climbed over Ã¢ÂÂ they climbed to $2.5 trillion driven by market values, solid long-term AUM flows, and continued loan and deposit growth.
Global banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, continued stabilization in oil prices and improvement in exposures drove provision expense lower in Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ16.
Continued expense discipline drove costs 10% lower year-over-year, led by reductions in operating and support costs.
Given the increase in rates and our progress with respect to reducing non-core assets, this quarterÃ¢ÂÂs results are more reflective of future trends with respect to these two line items.
Yes. That leaves Bank of America standing out quite a bit on the low end of payouts versus peers, so I am kind of wondering Ã¢ÂÂ two questions, one how do you guys think about that de minimis, you did well in 2016, any reason that Bank of America couldnÃ¢ÂÂt think about the de minimis top off or their restrictions on that or could you do that at some point this year on the de minimis.
Yes. ItÃ¢ÂÂs definitely moving up as we get more short-term rate hikes.
Our next question is from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
Our next question is from Matt OÃ¢ÂÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
So even if revenue is better than expected, but itÃ¢ÂÂs rate-driven, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not going to impact expenses materially?
",54.09,0.60497767
boa,q1,2017,"Good day, everyone and welcome to todayÃ¢ÂÂs Bank of America First Quarter Earnings Announcement Conference Call.
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter results.
We did that in quarter one despite $1.4 billion of annual retirement-eligible incentives and seasonally elevated payroll tax costs.
We saw $29 billion in long-term asset under management flows this quarter within our wealth management business.
Total net charge-offs of $934 million or 42 basis points on average loans increased slightly from Q4 due to expected seasonality in our credit card products but were down 13% from Q1 2016.
Note that Q1 2016 included a significant increase in reserves and global banking for energy exposures that was mostly offset by releases in consumer reserves in that quarter.
Our reserve coverage ratios -- excuse me, our reserve coverage remained strong with an allowance to loan ratio of 125 basis points and coverage level three times our annualized charge-offs.
Now, as Brian mentioned, we remain disciplined around deposit pricing given the investment we have made and customer relationships through preferred rewards and other deepening activities.
Non-interest income included improvements in service charges and a small increase in card income that was more than offset by decline in mortgage banking income.
Consumer banking credit quality remained solid with the net charge-off ratio declining 4 basis points to 121 basis points.
Also, note that our relationship deepening is improving NII and balance growth while holding fee line flat as we reward customers for doing more business with us.
We also believe these deposit accounts offer clients significant value in terms of transparency, convenience and safety, which also means theyÃ¢ÂÂre less likely to move their relationships.
This quarter also included the successful rollout of Merrill Edge guided investing for clients who want some advice from our CAO office but donÃ¢ÂÂt desire a fully advised relationship.
LetÃ¢ÂÂs review global wealth and investment management which produced earnings of $770 million and record pre-tax offering margin of 27%, while returning 22% on allocated capital.
Client balances climbed to nearly $2.6 trillion driven by market values, solid long-term AUM flows, and continued loan growth.
Global banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, albeit at a slower pace.
The only other thing worth pointing out here is a reminder that this is where we book the annual retirement-eligible incentive and elevated Q1 payroll tax before they get allocated out to the line of business throughout the year.
Asset quality remains strong and net charge-offs low.
I hope you noted that if one allocates annual retirement-eligible incentives and seasonally payroll elevated tax throughout the year, we are basically at our return targets this quarter.
[Operator Instructions] And weÃ¢ÂÂll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre adding new accounts; we had 1.2 million cards this quarter.
Brian, when you look out longer term and if you turn back the clock when the industry before the financial crisis typically earned a 120 on assets, 130 basis points on assets and a more normal interest rate environment.
And then most importantly, was brining expense structure down dramatically five or six years ago, Tom and the team did by almost $1 billion in quarter in operating expense of markets business alone and then maintaining it there and continuing to push it down where revenues have stabilized and come back up.
I mean, obviously one thing thatÃ¢ÂÂs has been helpful for returns in banking is very benign credit environment, commercial charge-offs with 10 basis points this quarter.
And weÃ¢ÂÂll take our next question from Matt OÃ¢ÂÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
Yes. I would say, weÃ¢ÂÂre in a little bit more positive place right now, where -- even where rates are having long-term rates have gone up here over the last two quarters.
This quarter, we produced strong revenue growth; we drove cost savings that offset higher revenue related cost; and we managed risk well; and we returned more capital to you, our shareholders through dividends and increased repurchased shares than any period since the crisis.
Those earnings were up 40% compared to the first quarter of last year, driven by 700 basis points of operating leverage.
On a year-over-year basis, our average deposits were up $58 billion, average loans were up $21 billion, and sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were up 23% with better client activity.
These figures reflect solid progress in this quarter against our long-term targets, but are even closer, if you were to allocate the seasonal aspects of the retirement-eligible compensation costs and elevated payroll tax expenses, across the years, just opposed to putting it all in the first quarter.
Even though the quarter one is typically a good capital markets quarter for us, if you just spread those costs, youÃ¢ÂÂll see that across all the quarters, the metrics this quarter would then reflect an efficiency ratio of near 62%, return on assets nearly 100 basis points and return on tangible common equity of 12%.
On slide four, as I mentioned, the key to profitability in this environment is to drive good core customer growth and revenue while controlling our costs to drive operating leverage.
This quarter, you can see on the slide four better revenue growth on year-over-year base across each of our business segments.
Our global banking business produced a record revenue quarter, led by a strong investment banking results and that generated $1.7 billion in after-tax earnings.
Lastly, our global markets business earned $1.3 billion in after-tax earnings, generating a 15% return on its allocated capital.
Our other category shows a loss, driven mostly by the $1 billion in first quarter of FAS 123 cost and related personnel taxes, which gets allocated across the business segments throughout the year.
But the reduction in losses year-over-year was driven by improved operating costs in the Company and lower litigation expense.
While many of you might focus on rates and our leverage to rising rates, note that the $1.5 billion in year-over-year revenue growth is split 40% for NII which is driven by rate and by also the growth in loan and deposit balances, and the other 60% was driven through non-interest revenue.
Our rates paid has remained steady at 9 basis points on deposits while at the same time we have grown those deposits, 5% year-over-year or $58 billion.
On lending activity, weÃ¢ÂÂve been in a lot of discussion regarding a slowdown and our core middle market business representing the broad base of American companies, our business loans grew 7% year-over-year and our smaller business segments business banking and small business were up 3% and small business had the best production quarter in its history.
First, we saw higher trading-related assets in global markets business with incremental customer activity following a seasonal slowdown at the end of Q4; secondly, we had higher cash levels, driven by seasonal deposit growth, primarily from tax refunds.
Global liquidity sources increased in the quarter, driven by higher deposit flows and bank funding.
The ratio also benefited from an $11 billion -- excuse me, a $14 billion decline in RWA, driven by lower exposure in our global markets business, lower card exposure and legacy asset runoff.
We think these growth rates are responsible given the economy grew around 2% year-over-year.
On the bottom of the chart, note the $58 billion, 5% year-over-year growth in average deposits, which is driven by 10% growth in consumer banking.
The stability of our asset quality and loss trends reflects many years now of disciplined client selection and strong underwriting practices that are foundational to our responsible growth and through-the-cycle performance.
As of 3/31, an instantaneous 100 basis-point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $3.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months, which is consistent with our position at year-end.
Given a one month LIBOR rise of about 25 basis points with the March hike and the long-end down, we should focus on the $2.5 billion short-end benefit; dividing that by four, get you a quarterly run rate of roughly $600 million for a 100 basis-point shock; assuming itÃ¢ÂÂs only 25 basis points instead of a 100 would get you to approximately $150 million benefit in the quarter.
From there, we would expect continued modest growth in NII in the second half of 2017, assuming modest growth in loans and deposits and rates at least above where they are today.
Our Company-wide simplification efforts and the $110 million in lower litigation costs offset a number of higher expenses year-over-year, including $150 million of higher incentives for annual retirement-eligible employees and seasonally elevated payroll taxes; $190 million of higher incentives associated with revenue growth across wealth management, global banking and global markets, and $160 million of higher expenses due to changes in our share price with respect to accounting from employee stock based awards.
This segment produced $1.9 billion earnings, growing 7% year-over-year and returning 21% on allocated capital.
Note that that 21% return is on $37 billion of allocated capital, which is an increase of $3 billion this quarter, given growth in their loans and deposits.
First, as usual in the upper left, the statutory reminder of our strong competitive position; second, as we point out each quarter, while we report NII and non-interest income separately, our strategy remains focused on relationship deepening and growing total revenue while improving operating leverage through expense discipline.
Average deposits continued their strong growth, up $57 billion or 10% year-over-year, outpacing the industry.
Focusing on client balances on the bottom left, you can see the success we continue to have growing deposits, loans and brokerage assets.
Also note the $29 billion of long-term AUM flows this quarter reflecting strong client activity, as well as the continuing shift from IRA brokerage to AUM.
Revenue growth coupled with expense management, improved the efficiency ratio 500 basis points to 44%.
This quarter shows the value of our businesses as rates begin to rise and as we experience increased capital markets activity.
For years, we have stayed focused on growing responsibly, including staying within our risk and client frameworks and making our growth more sustainable by simplifying the Company and improving efficiency.
We created operating leverage in each of our business segments, and we returned more capital to shareholders than in any quarter since the financial crisis.
So, if you look at it overall, weÃ¢ÂÂve been able to outgrow the economy, but weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be dependent upon, the economy keep growing, but what weÃ¢ÂÂre showing across last couple of years with the discipline we have, driving deeper penetration or customers working hard on our relationships, even with repositioning portfolios, you can see in some of the slides and/or making sure that we maintain great discipline, weÃ¢ÂÂve been able to grow the mid single digits as weÃ¢ÂÂve told you against the backdrop of economy growing 1.5% to 2%.
Separate question on capital, with the CET1 at 11% now versus the 2019 requirement of 9.5%, what kind of buffers are you thinking of holding and what level of CET1 feels like the right target for you longer term?
I think the way for you Steve to think about is look at the global markets year-over-year and what you see there is with that substantial rise in revenue, the expense growth absent, last year we had a credit and litigation issue, we had an expense, so you had a pretty good reversal there; absent that, it was 2% growth and as Paul said, had 6% less people.
I think we have been building our capital year-over-year, and you should expect us to continue to do that since we have both the strong cushion under CCAR.
So, on the consumer fee side, I wanted to just ask, we saw kind of a little bit of a positive turn in both card income and also in the brokers line, which is the first time in a while weÃ¢ÂÂve seen both of those move the right way.
But as you point out, the card income line remains I think in terms of growth, remains muted by competition around customer rewards.
I think Gerard this is the focus weÃ¢ÂÂve talked to you about getting above 100 basis points and with the adjustments of sort of smoothing out the first quarter little bit from the one time, annual expenses occur in the first quarter, youÃ¢ÂÂre getting close to that.
Our performance in global markets is going to be a direct result of client activity as we say every quarter.
I think if you look at our disclosures, youÃ¢ÂÂll see that the 100 basis-point rate shock at the end of the year was basically the same as it is right now.
Revenue growth of 7%, flat expenses, 700 basis points of operating leverage across our franchise, good client growth in each of the business and our asset quality remains strong.
",48.47,0.931763
boa,q2,2017,"As we look at the next slide on first half line of business results, I'm going to let Paul talk about the details of the quarter in a minute but I wanted to highlight basically two things.
First, momentum in the businesses has comparing the first half of this year versus the first half of last year, and second, a focus a bit on our Consumer business as it reached $2 billion in after tax earnings this quarter.
Consumer banking produced $3.9 billion in after tax earnings for the first half of the year growing 14% from 2016.
Our Global Wealth and Investment Management business recorded first half earnings of $1.6 billion, up 9% year-over-year with a 27% profit margin.
And finally, when you look at our Global Markets business, they're in $2.1 billion in the first half and generated 12% return on its capital.
So given the $2 billion earnings milestone, I want to talk about and focus on the multi-year effort this business is going through.
As you can see also from the crisis forward, we had focused on underwriting prime and super-prime customers and you can see that in the change in total net charge offs that occurred prior to 2014 and it remains in good stead over the last four years.
Today's business operate to the 52% efficiency ratio and with continuing to drive the customer behavior changes, continued investments for further cost improvements, we expect that to go lower.
So for the end of the day, our consumer business is an example of drive responsible growth, growing with no excuses, doing it on a right way the customer, doing it and managing risk well and importantly doing on a sustainable investment basis investing in the future or producing great returns in the current.
First, we completed the sale of our U.K. consumer card business during the quarter resulting in a small after-tax gain.
Overall, end-of-period assets increased a modest $7 billion from Q1 despite the sale of assets totaling $11 billion associated with the U.K. card business.
When looking at deposits on a year-over-year basis, they are up $47 billion or 4% from Q2 2016 driven entirely by our consumer banking business.
Loans on end-of-period basis were up $11 million from Q1 as broad based growth across consumer and commercial loans was modestly offset by the run off of legacy non-core loans.
This increase was driven by $4.9 billion of net income available to common and improved OCI of $700 million offset by common dividend and net share repurchases totaling $2.8 billion in the quarter.
Compared to Q1 2017 NII was relatively flat, as the benefit from an increase in short-end rates was offset by a number of factors, including lower long-end rates in the quarter.
And third, going forward, we will also feel the effects of the full quarter loss of interest income from U.K. card equating to about $225 million.
With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 6/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $3.2 billion over the subsequent 12 months, which is broadly in line with our position at the end of the first quarter and continues to be predominantly driven by our sensitivity to short-end rates.
We feel good about our expense progress this quarter, especially in light of our continued investments in sales professionals and new technology.
Average deposits grew 9%, and Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew 21%, improvement in NII drove the 9% revenue growth, which was driven by an increase in the value of deposits given the rise insurance rates as well as solid loan growth.
Turning to Slide 15, let's review a global wealth and investment management, which produce record earnings of $804 million, a pre-tax margin of 28% and a return on allocated capital of 23%.
We saw $28 billion of AUM inflow this quarter, continuing the strength of $29 billion in Q1, net interest income rose 14%, driven by an increase in the value of deposits given the rising short-term rates as well as an increase in loans.
A number of results to note, given the strong performance, record revenue in the quarter, record advisory fees, record first half revenue and net income, and year-to-date, we remain ranked number three in investment banking with fees of $3.1 billion.
Looking at trends on Slide 18 and comparing to Q2 last year, average loans were up $11 billion or 3% with the exception of CRE, loan growth was fairly broad based with C&I loans, up 5% in middle market lending.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.1%, which includes approximately $700 million of tax expense recorded in conjunction with the sale of U.K. card.
Importantly, we continue to invest in new technology and capabilities, while adding sales professionals in certain businesses and we significantly increase the amount of capital we returned to shareholders and announce plans to increase that even more.
These results tell us the responsible growth is working and that we are well positioned to continue to invest in and grow with our customers and clients as the economy continues to improve.
And the tagalong for net interest income guidance is, as you mentioned, very low deposit beta on the consumer side, just two basis points up in the quarter.
So we think we made pretty good progress year-over-year and we just have to continue to make that type of progress over the next few quarters and we'll get there.
Over the past several quarters, we used to have the major drops as we get a position, but it's going to have been $100 million-ish year-over-year step-down from the prior year, and so you'll see that kind of play out, we think.
And so that's what plays your benefit here because in the end of the day as rates continue to rise, if they continue to rise, the value of the consumer deposit franchise as being around this industry for a long time is going to be driven by the advantage and the checking balances and then some of the other balances will help, but there will be more rate sensitive.
So the question is how do you gain share and what you see is if you think about it year-over-year our Consumer Business grew about $60 billion and deposits around about half of that was in checking account balances, one half of that.
And so as you think about it that's what's going to drive a lot of deposits value and if you look at some of the rates and volumes charts, even you get to be interesting things, we look at the corporation overall, year-over-year our deposit costs on interest-bearing not non-interest-bearing up $100 million, 60 of that was in the U.S. and 40 of it is on 10% the interest-bearing deposits outside the U.S. So we feel good about the franchise and where we need to price because it's more investment orient say in the GWIM business.
So just think about the future, next couple of quarters we've got seasonality, which is going to be all else equal for the years normal it's going to be lowering the net charge-off rate.
If you just want to focus in on the risk adjustment margin that's going to - I think perform well in line with the industry and probably just a little bit lower, but we're more focused on total revenue.
So we'll - think we'd have to down 15, 17 branches linked quarter, a 100 odd year-over-year, that'll continue to happen.
I'd say that you seen us manage it well and we would expect to continue to manage it well in the future but we're not going to get ahead of the customer and create any disruption to the growth we're seeing in the core channel.
So expect us to continue to work on optimization of balance sheet, really at the end of day, opening up the difference in our GAAP capital levels for lack of a better term in our regulatory cap levels so we're down RWA on advanced based down 30-odd billion this quarter.
If we go back and think about where we started the quarter, where we ended it, we took out about half of what we thought to increase was going to be due to the card.
If you want to build any models, but on the revenue side, it's primarily interest income, think about $10 billion of receivables at 9%, plus you got a little small amount of card income I think that was around 30 million in the second quarter.
If you look in our supplement, you can see I think the net charge-offs ratios it's been running a little bit less than 2% call it $40 million, $45 million per quarter.
Just look at back up the first half of the year we think about the rate environment it's really changed on the short-end just to give you sense how it works, we've got $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion pick up in first half NII versus last year.
Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Bank of America 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Announcement.
That mantra drives the way we manage our cost effectively while at the same time making continued large investments in people and technology for the long term value of this franchise.
Year-over-year net interest income improvement of nearly $900 million drove revenue growth proving the value of this deposit-rich franchise.
We continued also to make progress on our returns and our return on tangible common equity moved above 11%, the first time despite increasing capital levels.
This was achieved with good revenue improvement in controlling costs and driving operating leverage while maintaining great credit quality.
Our Global Banking business serving commercial customers and commercial lending Treasury Services investment banking produced first half profits of $3.5 billion after tax.
Earnings up 36% from last year with strong operating leverage on operating basis and lower credit costs.
This quarter for example, this year we've rolled out our cash for customer interface for mobile devices making that cash management services more convenient for our clients.
Also you can see our expenses in a lower right hand side continue to drive tremendous operating leverage leading to that net income growth.
These increases in assets were offset by a decline in cash driven by seasonal deposit outflows associate with tax payments and a shift from deposits to a AUM brokerage and our Wealth Management business.
CET1 increased $4.4 billion to $168.7 billion driven by earnings, utilization of differed tax assets and less goodwill deductions given the U.K. card sale.
The CET1 ratio also benefit from a $34 billion decline in RWA driven by continued optimization work including model improvements as well as the sale of U.K. card.
There was a lot of Capital Markets activity this quarter and this may have impacted more than usual loan growth among larger corporates as a number of funded bridge loans were paid-off and as borrowers substituted bonds for loans in a flattening curve environment.
As I have emphasized before the stability of our asset quality and loss trends reflects years of disciplined client selection and strengthened underwriting standards along with an improving economy.
Credit quality continues to be solid with net charge-offs, NPLs, delinquencies and reservable criticized exposure all improving from Q1.
Provision expense is $726 million declined $109 million from Q1 and was down $250 million from Q2 2016 driven by lower losses in consumer real estate and improvements across most of our Commercial portfolio particularly energy.
Our reserve coverage remained strong with an allowance to loans coverage ratio of 120 basis points and coverage level three times our annual net charge-offs.
NII is up 868 million or 9% driven by an improving spread between our asset yields and deposit pricing in an environment where both short-end rates and long-end rates increased.
The efficiency ratio hit our 60% target this quarter, improving 300 basis points year-over-year.
The business created 900 basis points of operating leverage holding expenses flat while growing revenue 9%.
Non-interest income included improvement in service charges and a small increase in card income that was more than offset by decline in mortgage banking income.
Through continued efforts to drive costs down, the efficiency ratio improved nearly 500 basis point to 52%.
Consumer Banking credit quality remained strong with a net charge-off ratio of 121 basis points.
Our strategy remains focused on relationship deepening and growing total revenue while improving operating leverage through expense discipline.
Also note that our relationship deepening preferred rewards program is improving NII and balance growth while holding fee line flat as we reward customers for doing more business with us.
Spending levels on debit and credit cards were up 6% year-over-year and new issuance of credit cards was a solid at $1.3 million, spending levels on cards drives revenue but are largely offset by rewards given back to customers.
The digitization efforts that Brian discussed earlier and other productivity improvements continue to drive expenses lower, expenses were stable compared to Q2 2016 despite strong revenue growth and increases in the FDIC assessment rate and charges.
Adjusting for the prior period gain, non-interesting income improved 5% as 10% higher asset management fees were partially offset by lower transactional revenue.
Client balances now exceed 2.6 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth.
Earnings increased 19% from Q2 '16 driven by good results across investment banking and treasury services.
Year-over-year revenue growth of 7% coupled with flat expenses drove operating leverage of 600 basis points.
Within debt capital markets we saw a solid increase in investment grade fees while leverage finance declined.
Sales and trading revenue of $3.4 billion excluding net DVA was down 9% from Q2 2016 finishing ahead of our mid-quarter expectations.
Equity sales in trading was up 3% percent year-over-year to $1.1 billion benefiting from growth in client financing activity offset by slower secondary market revenue.
Revenue here also includes to roughly $800 million pre-tax gain from the U.K. card transaction which was almost entirely offset by related tax expense recorded here as well.
A few summary points to wrap up, again this quarter we created operating leverage by managing expenses while improving revenue.
For years, we have been focused on growing responsibly including staying within our risk and client frameworks as well as simplifying the company to improve operational efficiency all aimed at making our growth more sustainable.
We had some questions come in on how you are thinking improvements there could help you given that it's not directly in the CCAR stress test.
So Brian, I appreciate the helpful commentary you've given on capital ratios and the continued effort to optimize your RWAs. Steven Chubak

boa,q3,2017,"Response for growth is delivering for our customers and for you our shareholders with strong operating leverage, strong credit results, and strong expense management.
First if you look at this quarter compared to year ago revenue grew 1% on a reported basis.
If you look at what drives that revenue growth, average loans and business segments grew 6% year-over-year.
So that remains our focus, continue to drive growth, but on occasions where capital markets might be slower and might be less growth and revenue, we have to manage our expenses well.
The business is driving operating leverage as we optimize our delivery network continues to digitize the business and follow the customer's behavior and as it changes over time.
In our wealth management business the teams continue to do a good job and you see earnings were up 10% on a year-to-date basis.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 6, overall compared to June 30, end of period assets increased $29 billion, driven by strong deposit growth that funded an increase in loans to customers with the remainder invested in securities and cash.
Turning to Slide 7, on an average basis total loans increased to $918 billion, note that the sale of UK card, which was recorded in All Other impacted year-over-year comparison of average loans by $9.3 billion.
Loan growth continue to be dampened by the run-off of non-core consumer real estate loans and All Other, year-over-year loans in All Other including the sale of UK card were down 28 billion.
This growth was driven by consumer segments, deposits increasing by $53 billion or nearly 9% year-over-year.
With respect to consumer net charge-offs were down from Q2, included in the quarter were recoveries on the sale of some consumer real estate loans, partially offsetting this recovery benefit was the negative impact of clarifying guidance from the regulators on bankruptcies, which increased our consumer losses this quarter.
Compared to Q2 2017 NII increased 175 million as the benefits from an increase in short-end rates and an extra day of interest, as well as loan and deposit growth was mitigated by a number of factors.
Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on Slide 12, earnings were $2.1 billion growing 15% year-over-year and returning 22% on allocated capital.
Within revenue, mortgage banking income was the only major category that was lower year-over-year, driven by our strategy of holding more originations on balance sheet instead of selling to the agencies, as we like the economics of holding these high quality originations.
Focusing on client balances on the bottom left you can see the success we continue to have growing deposits, loans, and brokerage assets.
Our 9% year-over-year average deposit growth continued to outpace the industry, while the rate paid remained low and stable.
Turning to Slide 14, letÃ¢ÂÂs look again this quarter at digital banking highlights as they continue to shape the way we do business with our customers.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we continue our multi-year branch refurbishment program, and it is also why we continue to add new financial centers in markets where we have never had a Bank of America Center, but we have a strong presence in other lines of business.
The increase in deposit rates at the end of the second quarter helped to mitigate the movement of client balances from deposits to other cash investment alternatives within AUM and brokerage.
As Brian mentioned, our loan growth in global banking has been pretty consistent over the past three or four quarters at 4% to 6% on a year-over-year basis.
While the quarter is down from Q3 2016 as you can see on the lower left box, sales and trading revenue has been fairly consistent on a year-to-date basis for the last three years at roughly $10.5 billion.
Again this quarter, we created positive operating leverage by growing revenue, while lowering expenses.
And as Brian pointed out, this continued a trend of many quarters of positive operating leverage.
We continue to invest in new technologies and capabilities, while adding sales professionals in certain businesses and we did all this on nearly doubling the amount of capital we returned to shareholders this year versus last year.
This tells us that responsible growth is working and that we are well positioned to continue to invest in and grow with our customers and clients as the economy continues to improve.
I think we have leadership position if thatÃ¢ÂÂs told just by other people and how they rate people in terms of activities and capabilities and things like that, but most importantly itÃ¢ÂÂs how your customers use you, and what you see going on.
We are excited about the Zelle payment levels because at the end of the day we have $5 billion that we spend a year on the cash currency, checks moving around our company and the system that the way we are going to get there is by coming, you know digitizing those and eliminating cash and driving that, and so things like Zelle, whether small numbers compared to all the other payment forms today the pace that they are growing at with the digital wallets and other things will help drive it there
2000 more salespeople, a lot of those in consumer, refurbishing all the branches, building out branches, and things like that because at the end of the day 20% odd of sales were on digital and mobile, but 80% arenÃ¢ÂÂt and because of the nature of the intimate customer discussions because of the nature of what customers want to discuss and have face-to-face help on the branches are critically important to that.
Think about the deposit growth year-over-year and consumer of 50 odd billion dollars and start to think about that in the context of activity.
We instituted - a year ago now, it is not longer, we pulled back a little bit on CRE, so we are still servicing customers there, we are still making loans, but weÃ¢ÂÂre not, we're just being a little bit more cautious, and so you're not seeing a lot of growth in our CRE balances.
But if you look at the different categories, you're going to see that most of the move is in the now Money Market, which is - that's where the Wealth Management business is, and then the $240 billion odd number in there, about $140 billion of it is really peopleÃ¢ÂÂs invested cash.
And so if we make an allocation like we did in the second quarter to less cash and more equities that actually brings deposits out and then people are obviously thinking as investment cash.
But if you think about it across a year, there's about a 75 basis point increase in Fed funds, and you start to put these numbers against and even Wealth Management is relatively modest in terms of the change in the overall.
The other thing that drives our profitability is, if you look at that page go down and you remember thatÃ¢ÂÂs non-interest bearing account, the deposits are still zero, and they grew - theyÃ¢ÂÂre $436 billion of non-interest bearing accounts.
And in terms of next year when you think about the $53 billion target doesn't look like you might need it.
In other words, over - IÃ¢ÂÂm not talking about next quarter, but over multiple years, when you continue to drive the revenue expense play here, because the 2 million of core transaction deposit account and getting it from $2,000 over the last 8, 10 years to $6,000 per account is a tremendous revenue lift by focusing primary accounts as the number of accounts actually fell by 10%.
The deposits to consumer just, Mike, which are more and small business, which are more related to your thing, weÃ¢ÂÂre actually up 9% year-over-year, not 4%, that's the overall incorporate level, including GWIM commercial.
And so they were able to shutdown some of the runoff as, Paul just described, but it's really localized in the GWIM business, and it's really driven by a subset of those deposits, which are in asset management accounts and in brokerage accounts that are part of an investment strategy that that is different than transactional checking accounts and things that are driving both in our commercial business and our consumer business.
So, if we get a 25 basis point rate hike in December, again, most of that will see in the first quarter, the benefit, and it's going to depend on what our customers need and want and what the competitive dynamic is.
We've been - look, we've been experiencing solid long growth in consumer and GWIM and in - on the wholesale side and global banking you saw that again this quarter.
And so if you think about our deposit growth and the size of our deposits relative to our loans, every quarter we grow deposits and we put as much of that to work as we can in loan growth and whatever doesn't go to loans and client growth goes into the investment portfolio or cash.
But if we continue to really push that with - itÃ¢ÂÂs almost $900 billion in deposits in our GWIM consumer businesses, which are tremendously valuable in terms of what drives this franchisers profit.
Yes, just a point I was getting at is, you're paying up a little bit on the deposit side in the Wealth Management business.
Yes, but I mean think about the all-in cost and itÃ¢ÂÂs still much - it's still very advantage, because a $600 million a quarter for the $1.2 trillion in deposits in total just think about that a second, and if you think that there's a lot of advantage in any yield curve.
So whatever metric and you can stun yourself with the opportunity, the number of customers who have their banking accounts that are in our Wealth Management business and other banks, hundreds of billions of dollars of bank deposit balances, loan balances, the amount of middle market investment banking goes to competitors from our middle market clients is 70%, 80% of their activity, which we should be capturing a lot more of.
But you've got to grow in a rational responsible basis, so and that's what's playing out in us this quarter relative to other people, I think.
If you get to the 53 billion whenever that is 18 or whenever you there around 18, you drive down your efficiency ratio even further to [indiscernible], so you are pretty close to, sort of, your competitors despite the fact that your business mix is one that has more wealth management and which has a higher efficiency ratio, so how should we think about your ability, the opportunity set to continue to drive positive operating leverage over a multi-year period and get your efficiency ratio down even further to the mid-to-low 50% range and I know itÃ¢ÂÂs a difficult question to answer, and it depends on a lot of things, but with technology and AI and cognitive computing and digitization and mobile banking, can we see efficiency ratios that maybe a few years ago we wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have even thought for a bank like Bank of America.
As you think about Bank of America for the quarter three of 2017 itÃ¢ÂÂs pretty straightforward, responsible growth.
We have been and we will continue to open centers and markets where you have a strong commercial banking wealth management client base that lack financial centers due to historical issues.
In addition to the technology investments, we have added 2000 primary sales professionals over the past 12 months, whether relationship bankers, financial advisors, commercial and business leaders.
Revenue of $21.8 billion was 1% higher than Q3 2016 as NII improvement and higher asset management fees outpaced decline in sales and trading, and mortgage banking income.
Loans on an end of period basis were up $10.5 billion from Q2 led by commercial activity, while consumer loan growth was mitigated by the continued run-off of legacy non-core loans.
The CET1 ratio also benefited from a modest $3 billion decline in RWA as growth in loans and low RWA density assets was offset by continuing optimization of the balance sheet.
We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach RWA increased $15 billion from Q2, driven by loan growth, but increases in capital more than offset asset growth resulting in a CET1 ratio improvement of 20 basis points to 12.2%.Supplementary leverage ratios for both the parent and bank continued to exceed US regulatory minimums that don't take effect until 2018.
Consumer banking and wealth management both experienced solid loan growth of 8%.
Both businesses continue to see good growth in residential mortgages.
Consumer banking also saw growth in credit card and vehicle loans, originations of new home equity loans was solid, but overall loan growth continues to be outpaced by pay downs.
Average deposits declined year-over-year in our wealth management segment as clients sought alternatives for their cash within brokerage or AUM.
Turning to asset quality on Slide 8, credit quality continues to be solid with net charge-offs, NPLs and reservable criticized exposure all showing improvement from Q2.
Total net charge-offs were 900 million or 39 basis points of average loans decreasing modestly from Q2.
Our reserve coverage remained strong with an allowance to loan ratio of 116 basis points and a coverage level three times our annual charge-offs.
Compared to Q3 2016, which has the same day count and seasonal factors, NII is up 960 million or more than 9% driven by an improving spread between our asset yields and deposit pricing.
The full quarter effect of the sale of UK card negatively impacted the comparison focusing on net interest yield it improved 18 basis points from Q3 2016 to 2.36% after adjusting for the impact of UK card.
Second, we raised rates broadly across our wealth management business to offer clients a competitive deposit alternative to cash alternatives within brokerage and AUM.
Looking ahead to Q4, assuming no changes in interest rates, NII growth will be dependent on loan and deposit growth and pricing.
With respect to asset sensitivity as of 930 [ph] an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by 3.2 billion over the subsequent 12 months.
Productivity improvements were driven by our focus on digitizing processes and lowering our cost to deliver for our customers.
Compared to Q3 2016, in addition to overall operating cost improvements we reduced personnel expense, which included costs associated with our UK card business, as well as non-personal expense, which included lower litigation expenses.
With respect to expenses, through continued efforts to drive operating leverage the efficiency ratio improved over 400 basis points to 51%.
Consumer banking credit quality reflected moderate seasoning and portfolio growth, which drove reserve build of 168 million in addition to the 800 million in net charge-offs.
Looking at revenue more broadly, we believe our relationship deepening prefers reward program is improving NII and balance growth, while mitigating industry pressures on fees as we reward customers for doing more business with us.
Expenses were up modestly compared to Q3 2016 despite strong revenue growth as optimization and digitalization savings were more than offset by investments and refurbishing branches and technology initiatives.
Also note on the bottom left the growth in mobile channel usage, this quarter we saw nearly 1.2 billion logins, which is up 19% versus Q3 2016 and more than 21% of all check deposit transactions are now done on mobile devices.
The market and client activity once again provided a tailwind for asset management fees, while at the same time transaction revenue continues to face headwinds as the industry evolves and adapts new fiduciary requirements, and the increasing adoption of passive investing.
Moving to Slide 16, we continue to see overall solid client engagement, capital balances rose to nearly 2.7 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth.
Average loans of $154 billion grew 8% year-over-year and reflect the continued trend of investment clients deepening their relationship with us.
Year-over-year revenue growth of 5% was driven by improved NII reflecting solid loan and deposit growth, compounded by rising short-term interest rates.
Revenue improvement coupled with lower expenses created operating leverage of 650 basis points and an efficiency ratio of 43%.
Excluding net DVA and versus Q3 2016 fixed sales and trading of 2.2 billion decreased 22% within fixed the decrease was driven by less favorable market conditions across credit products, especially mortgages combined with lower volatility in rates, products in the current quarter.
Equity sales and trading was up 2% year-over-year to a little less than a billion benefiting from growth in client financing activity, lower volatility also drove lower secondary market activity in equities.
Without this strength in diversity, one would have seen a lot more revenue volatility as client activity shifted from a product and market perspective over the last three years.
For years we have been focused on growing responsibly, while improving operating efficiency and making our growth more sustainable.
Asset quality remained strong as net charge-offs, NPLs, and commercial reserve-like criticized exposure all declined.
The activity grows faster, and I think you put it against any kind of mobile digital person out there, 1.2 [ph] billion customer interactions in the quarter shows you that people believe that it must be pretty good.
If you think about something like another global transaction service platform cash management, as people call it, there has always been this loss and revenue that you're fighting against when paper - which people pay us more to process turns to digital, we lose revenue, but we save expense at a faster rate.
And then consumer expense ratio 51% that - as you're getting more people onto your Zelle platform, et cetera, is there a line of sight to that going sub-50 at some point?
I think through both the revenue lift they get, as the rate structure rises and good expense management, weÃ¢ÂÂd expect that it should move down below 50 at some point.
We look at how the team works together and we deploy those people in units and between six - five or six core business of operating markets to make sure building markets.
If you think about the whole card business as we reshaped it over the last 10 years quite frankly has been a move to more and more relationship customers whose credit statistics are relatively consistent over time.
Maybe a quick question on rate sensitivity, it looks like it didn't change despite absorbing another rate hike this past quarter.
",44.82,0.7410141
boa,q4,2017,"In fact, this is the twelfth straight quarter where we have had reported a positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis and you can see that on Slide 3 and we did it the right way.
In total, the tax line includes $1.9 billion aggregate expense with the multiple impacts of the Tax Act including the tax benefit of the charge for new energy investments that I just mentioned as well as the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.
Expenses declined 1%, which included roughly $200 million with the shared success bonuses in late December that Brian mentioned, plus an acceleration of planned charitable contribution in late December as we looked to share some of the future tax savings with our teams and the communities we serve.
Note that the Q2 sales of UK cards, which was a quarter than all other, impacted the year-over-year comparisons of average loans by $9 billion.
This growth was driven by consumer banking which increased by a $48 billion or nearly 8% year-over-year.
Compared to Q3 2017, NII increased $300 million driven by loans, securities, and asset growth in global markets, as well as a run up of short-end rates in anticipation of the FED funds cut and the deferrals.
On a full year basis, earnings were $8.2 billion growing 14% over 2016 with operating leverage driving the efficiency ratio to 50% by the end of the year.
Net charge-offs increased $107 million from Q4 2016 as we continued to experience modest and expected seasoning of our credit card portfolio and loan growth.
Revenue grew 8%, while expenses were up only 1% as the business reduced overhead to offset increases in investments and we added more than 400 bankers over the past few years as we continue to deepen and expand local coverage in commercial and business banking.
Year-over-year, earnings were down by $238 million driven by lower sales in trading results, higher technology investment spending and provisions.
The second question I get is, there is our focus change and we run the company differently given a lower tax rate and end of day is no.
We will continue to drive operational excellence, lowering operational expenses as weÃ¢ÂÂve done for many quarters in a row and improving our competitiveness as we develop and invest in new products and services.
In the end, whether through increased investments, capital distributions or supporting our clients, all this will benefit the economy and shareholders and drive our activities consistently responsible growth.
Third question is, do we think that the impact of tax reform will affect loan growth.
The question that we have to look at, Betsy as you reference is, is there an amount of investment that we may accelerate some of the things we are doing especially around consumer business but across all the business to accelerate the branch build out and some of the cities thatÃ¢ÂÂs proven to be very successful that we are doing over five years you want to speed it up a little bit.
So, the debate is, is there some amount that youÃ¢ÂÂd invest to help accelerate growth whether it be along the dimensions that weÃ¢ÂÂve been doing and will just improve our ability to get them done and speed it up it would be modest I think, is the best way to say.
Yes, I think, we want to focus all of you across all the business operating leverage and they tend to Ã¢ÂÂ theyÃ¢ÂÂve shown good progress at the company as a whole and each of the businesses and consumer can continually get operating leverage.
So, as we continue to get customers to adapt these new and exciting technologies, weÃ¢ÂÂll see more operating leverage, but itÃ¢ÂÂs been Ã¢ÂÂ the team has done a great job there, and I think theyÃ¢ÂÂll continue to improve it.
And then just last question on the dividend payout ratio, realize that earnings up with the lower tax rate, do you expect youÃ¢ÂÂll keep that dividend payout ratio flat or how are you thinking about the dividend and then overall capital return?
Brian, thanks for the comments on expenses and how you are thinking about some of the tax impacts and maybe accelerating investments.
I think the Ã¢ÂÂ as we said before, the key is to drive operating leverage as Betsy referenced John and continue to drive across the businesses.
Couple things weÃ¢ÂÂve been clear that leave aside the discussion about the investment on proceeds of taxes, but basically the $53 billion was a rate that we could kind of sustain around i.e., continuing to invest in operational improvement over time and keeping it relatively flat.
And so, we had a pretty good dynamic going and the sole question is, do you want to invest a bit to speed up and that would just increase that number by a little Ã¢ÂÂ by a bit and then play over the next couple of years.
I always come back, John, and youÃ¢ÂÂve followed our company closely, we have Ã¢ÂÂ we will continue to have the same rigor around the way weÃ¢ÂÂd run the company just because the tax rate is lower doesnÃ¢ÂÂt change how we are going to do it.
The question is, we took a little bit of money and accelerate investments and kind of run through a couple of years and probably drop back off.
But it be very modest and a greater context lot of investments get capitalized with the near term P&L impacts differ but basically from a conceptual framework, we think we can run the company in the low $53 billion approximate $1 billion on a consistent basis over the next couple of years with a caveat that we may look to invest part of the tax savings on top of that and weÃ¢ÂÂll be very clear when we do that.
I think it is Ã¢ÂÂ mechanically there is some things to help us over the next couple years in terms of some stuff running that pushes this up.
But Ã¢ÂÂ and then just switching over to wealth management, couple little questions on like, number one is, where is all the growth coming from, meaning you noted the strong flows, curious whatÃ¢ÂÂs current versus new clients and you also noted advises are up 3%.
But all that said, we feel good about 2018 NII growth, it is just going to be solid as itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be back to basics on loans, growing deposits, managing deposit rate paid.
One, the pricing strategy in consumer has already driven the relationships and so, as we look at pricing tiers and how we do it and set by market, set by product, set by type of customer depth and relationship, the rewards programs, the reward deposit balance along with Ã¢ÂÂ rates on loans and other types of things.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs an integrated business and a lot of people focus on the one aspect of it and try to isolate it, but itÃ¢ÂÂs actually a very integrated business, but to give you a couple other things, what hold us down is if you look at the deposits year-over-year, and consumer up $47 billion, the checking which is always going to be very low, it was up $30 billion of the $47 billion or $29 billion of the $37 billion and CDs are down $4 billion again.
They are all prime, core transaction accounts of the household which means the pay checks coming in Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs whatÃ¢ÂÂs driving the overall structure of the business and weÃ¢ÂÂll continue to do so.
Well, I think, when you talk about technology, the consumer bank has benefited by a lot of technology spending across the lot of dimensions including the way we distribute the environment t the branches Ã¢ÂÂ use of tablet type technology in the branches to integrate the customers, better call center technology.
So, we will continue to drive that, but I think, yes, we have invested, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not necessary what weÃ¢ÂÂve done for this year, itÃ¢ÂÂs $1 billion we probably invested in mobile technology over the last five, six years to get us here that now we are taking advantage of it and as you know it comes out the Merrill Edge capabilities continue to be improved to helping that affluent Ã¢ÂÂ mass affluent America.
I think, year-over-year the consumer business grew $47 billion of organic deposit growth.
Pretty decent rate and you are seeing growth across, just wondering what your expectation is for loan growth are as you look out and in a bigger sense, any sense of just the movement in commercial and corporate America in terms of starting to think about investing more in their businesses?
But as you go forward, you benefit from the lower tax rate you sort of right size your efficiency, you get to the $53 billion and drive positive operating leverage from there.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ if we just drive this company the same way and it will come out to be higher now and we will see those levels and we expect to continue to see it.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been running it on a responsible growth with the four elements, got to grow no excuses, got it Ã¢ÂÂ do it with it on a customer focused organic basis, got to do it with the right risk and got to be sustainable along the best place for people to work drive share our success with communities and drive operational excellence.
So, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think itÃ¢ÂÂs a major change in our industry frankly $200 million a year share, we are getting 2 million volunteer hours, billions of dollars of building modern housing investment earnings and $1 billion plus out to the CDFIs, we can rattle off all the stuff $100 billion and half way through.
Marty, I think weÃ¢ÂÂve got to look to it, so, given the fourth quarter and the $13.3 billion expenses, there is about a $145 million, $150 million of a one-time $1000 bonus to people under $100,000 $150,000 in our company plus we accelerate the $50 million of charitable donations in the fourth quarter 2017.
We are growing $40 billion, $50 billion year-over-year loans growth at a more modest rate especially due to run-offs.
Can you share with us in the investment bank what the pipeline looks like at the end of the fourth quarter coming into 2018?
So, the ability to accelerate those investments are largely based on what we think we can do that will be modest in a sense that, even a step of fair increase and the margin is not a big number in the overall scheme of things at the $53 billion expense level.
We had a good 2017 and we look forward to a great 2018 and we can do that by driving responsible growth, delivering value for our customers and for you our shareholders and we continue to do that.
Full year revenue is up 5% excluding the Tax Act impact while expenses declined 1%.
Excluding the Tax Act impact, our return on tangible common equity was 11% and our return on average Ã¢ÂÂ return on assets was 93 basis points pushing close to our long-term targets.
We also lowered cost so we continued our investments in digital capabilities for security protection for our customers; we show in our online and mobile banking leadership rankings.
The remaining decline in equity was mostly result of the decline in OCI as increases in long-end rates decreased the value of our debt securities portfolio.
Tangible book value per share of $16.96 was modestly above Q4 2016 as earnings over the year including the Tax Act impact offset share repurchases and dividends, as well as the convergence of Berkshire preferred stocks to common shares.
Under the standardized approach where risk sensitivity is less, funded and unfunded loan growth across the businesses drove a $22 billion increase in RWA.
Consumer banking led with a 9% increase with solid growth across mortgage, credit cards and vehicle loans.
The net reserve release reflects continued improvement and our legacy consumer real estate and energy portfolios.
Our reserve coverage remains strong with an allowance to loan coverage ratio of 112 basis points and a coverage level of 2.6 times our full year net charge-offs.
The Consumer credit card net charge-off ratio increased to 2.78% as the portfolio continues its expected seasoning.
However, remember, NII growth up on an FTE basis is completely offset by higher tax expense resulting in no change in earnings.
We expect these benefits over the medium-term to drive efficiencies that will help us offset inflationary cost and potentially increases in investments.
Cost of deposits which reflects non-interest expense as a percent of average deposits increased modestly because of year-end discretionary actions mentioned earlier to share future tax savings with low pay employees and the communities we serve.
Looking at revenue more broadly, we believe our relationship deepening, Preferred Rewards program is improving NII and growth of balances and allowing cost savings.
Spending levels and the one-time partner rebate drove a 5% revenue increase in card income, which continues to be impacted by strong competition on the rewards front.
By the way, customer satisfaction in Consumer Banking reached an historic high with roughly 80% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 at a 10 point scale.
We process payments for customers valued at $669 billion in Q4, annualized, that equates to over $2.5 trillion per year and note the 10% growth of digital payments relative to non-digital ebb 1% as customers continue to migrate from cash and checks helping us improve efficiency and reduce risk.
Market appreciation and client flows were once again a tailwind for asset management fees offsetting modest spread compression, at the same time, brokerage revenue continued to face headwinds as volumes declined and mix shifted.
Client balances rose to $2.75 trillion driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth.
Average loans of $157 billion grew 7% year-over-year continuing the trend of clients deepening their relationship with us.
Returning to Q4 year-over-year comparisons, revenue growth of 10% was driven by improved NII reflecting solid loan and deposit growth compounded by rising short-term interest rates.
Growth of loans in Global Banking remains fairly consistent with past several quarters increasing 4% year-over-year.
The outlook for loan growth given tax reform remains to be seen, but optimum Ã¢ÂÂ optimism among our clients is high.
Looking at trends on Slide 16 and comparing to Q4 last year, with respect to average loans, growth of 4% was led by corporate borrowers, evenly balanced between domestic and international clients.
In Global Banking, loan spreads were down one basis point compared to Q3 2017 continuing the trend weÃ¢ÂÂve seen all year which modestly compressed spreads year-over-year by mid single-digits.
Equity sales and trading at just shy of $1 billion was stable year-over-year as growth in client financing activity offset declines in cash and derivatives trading given lower levels of volatility and client activity.
With respect to expenses, Q4 2017 was 5% higher than Q4 2016 as lower revenue-related incentive cost were more than offset by continued investments in technology.
However in the medium to long-term, more after tax cash flow came from real estate business and we will benefit by greater loan growth as those businesses invest those proceeds.
Another question we often get is this tax reform change or come into $53 billion goal for 2018.
I wanted to understand from your prepared remarks, you are saying that $53 billion, youÃ¢ÂÂve already met it and youÃ¢ÂÂll retain it for the full year or may change your outlook based on how the customer demand evolves with the tax plan and within that just wondering if you are expecting that youÃ¢ÂÂll be able to generate more operating leverage in particular in the consumer space given the groundwork youÃ¢ÂÂve laid in digital payments and the branch networks?
Okay, and then just for Paul, on the overdraft policy understanding the long-term franchise value of the new policy, trying to think about the near-term financial impact, is there any kind of pull through continuation or drag on deposit fees that might come from the new overdraft policy or is that impact maybe fully in the fourth quarter numbers yet?
We would expect provision to roughly match net charge-offs with reserve releases moderating over time as we continue to build allowance in support of loan growth, those releases are being driven by non-core consumer real estate and energy.
So most of the growth is coming through our advisor training platform which we consolidated between the work Ã¢ÂÂ the people who work in the branches and people who work in the Merrill offices brought into one day training, product training program again for effectiveness and we think that has great prospects.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs consistent I think with what we are seeing for low figure big peers, but just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of when they Ã¢ÂÂ start seeing little bit of upward pressure there and being the biggest deposit player as you might be one of the setters of the price there as we think about rates going forward.
Yes, I am not sure how helpful I am going to be to you, I would just make a couple of points that weÃ¢ÂÂve made many times and that the industry really hasnÃ¢ÂÂt seen on the retail side deposit rates increasing sort of much or at all on traditional accounts.
What we told you guys is we got to $53 billion for 2018 be relatively flat thereon absorbing 6% medical care cost increases raises and things like that and that comes through ability to continue to investment effectiveness and efficiency.
",51.55,0.7580002
boa,q1,2018,"Consumer led our deposit growth with an increase of 6%, or $38 billion in deposits year-over-year, a strong showing.
We reported credit charge-offs of $911 million, 40 basis points of average loans, lower than both the prior quarter and the prior year ago quarter.
In fact, we reported a net charge-off ratio below 50 basis points now for 13 of the last 16 quarters, thatÃ¢ÂÂs four years of relative consistency.
And while our markets balance sheet grew to support our clients, our value of risk remain stable year-over-year.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been able to again reduce quarterly operating expenses this quarter on a year-over-year basis.
Growth in earnings was driven by not only tax reform, but also operating leverage and continued strong asset quality, which is easily seen in our $8.4 billion pre-tax income, which was up 15% year-over-year.
Overall, compared to the end of Q4 end of period assets of $2.3 trillion increased $47 billion, driven by growth to support Global Markets clients, as well as higher cash balances from strong deposit growth.
The OCI decrease was driven by a $4 billion after-tax decline in the recorded value of our asset securities, given the increase in long-end rates in Q1.
Loan growth continue to be dampened by the run-off of non-core loans, on the other hand, loans in our business segments were up $45 billion, or 5.5% year-over-year.
Switching to average deposits and looking at the bottom right, growth was $41 billion, or 3% year-over-year.
Year-over-year, GAAP NII is up $550 million, or 5%, reflecting the benefits of both higher interest rates, as well as long deposit growth, partially offsetting this growth was the absence of NII resulting from 2Q 2017 sale of the UK consumer credit card business and higher funding costs for Global Markets.
We continue to reduce non-client-facing roles, while increasing client-facing roles such as relationship bankers in consumer, business banking and commercial, as well as financial advisers in wealth management.
Another very strong quarter for this business, as the value of deposits, growth of both loans and deposits as well as the investments we have made in people and our ability to better connect with customers continue to improve financial results.
The value of our deposits as rates rose along with growth in client balances drove the 9% year-over-year improvement in revenue.
Year-over-year net charge-offs increased $105 million, as we continue to experience modest and expected seasoning of our credit card portfolio along with loan growth.
Looking first at revenue, driven by NII growth, revenue grew 9% year-over-year, reflecting the value of our deposits and our relationships with customers, which continue to deepen as we expand capabilities.
Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, you can see the success we continue to have growing deposits, loans and brokerage assets.
Strong client activity, a market, which was up year-over-year, higher rates and solid expense management pushed GWIMÃ¢ÂÂs earnings this quarter to over $1 billion for the first time ever.
Year-over-year client balances rose $140 billion, or 5% to $2.7 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth.
Average loans of $159 billion grew 7% year-over-year and the growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate, as well as structured lending.
On a pre-tax basis, earnings declined 2% year-over-year, driven by lower investment banking fees and revenue impacts on an FTE basis of tax reform with respect to tax advantage assets.
Global Banking grew loans 3% year-over-year to a record $352 billion.
On a pre-tax basis, earnings were down modestly year-over-year, driven by lower revenue and increased expenses from continued technology investments, up 1% year-over-year, sales and trading totaled $4.1 - of the $4.7 billion in revenue.
In terms of expenses, Paul and Brian, youÃ¢ÂÂve - youÃ¢ÂÂre on track clearly to get to your target of the ballpark $53 billion for this year.
John, itÃ¢ÂÂs our view - what we said, I think, the last quarter was the investments weÃ¢ÂÂll make are - will be funded with the hard work in operating leverage and simplify and improve in organizational health and operational excellence.
And weÃ¢ÂÂve - we announced the investments weÃ¢ÂÂre making in the retail business and itÃ¢ÂÂs all contemplated with in the $53 billion - in the low $53 billion level, which we ought to be able to maintain in 1920.
And then also on the credit cards, it looks like youÃ¢ÂÂre getting solid card growth now and balances of 5% year-over-year.
We would expect it to be around 3% kind of if you look at the remainder of the year, remember, Q2 is usually seasonally the highest quarter in terms of credit card net charge-off.
IÃ¢ÂÂd add one thing, John, people forget that we also got out of - been sold a lot of businesses pieces and card over the years, including another one that will go out over the next quarter or so.
And so the growth weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in the underlying million plus cards - new cards we do every quarter and the usage by the customers and primary usage has been pretty consistent and ought to bode well for continued growth.
I think the reason for that is, certainly, in Bank of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs case, we deliver a lot of value to depositors, transparency, convenience, safety, mobile banking, online banking, weÃ¢ÂÂre rolling out new capabilities every day with Erica, nationwide network, rewards, advice and counsel that has real value to people beyond just the deposit rate paid.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue to balance the needs of our customers in the competitive market environment with that of our shareholdersÃ¢ÂÂ interests and weÃ¢ÂÂll do the right thing at the right moment.
And as we add more accounts and grow in these new markets, weÃ¢ÂÂre getting the primary relationship in the household, which means youÃ¢ÂÂre getting the transaction money, which is moving at all times.
I guess, the first thing I would say, I think, we think itÃ¢ÂÂs constructive, right, growing the balance sheet and increasing buybacks or continuing buybacks and stressfully to make a lot of sense.
And on an ongoing forward-looking basis, we feel good about the stress depletion and the stress capital buffer because of the way we run the company, and weÃ¢ÂÂre focused on responsible growth, loans in consumer prime and super price.
So, I think itÃ¢ÂÂs just going to keep going in the right direction and all that bodes well to helping us make that change with expenses basically down in the company year-over-year and consumer basically flattish.
Ã¢ÂÂ¦quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year again and again, while weÃ¢ÂÂre still adding new branches and investing in those cities at the same time.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs always going to be a question of modest changes, because remember, weÃ¢ÂÂre adding the branches and taking them out and redoing branches and making them bigger.
So on a year-over-year basis a lot of the increase in Global Markets was a result of client activity in equities.
We have to make sure we have enough liquidity and enough capital to run the company in good times and bad, and I think weÃ¢ÂÂre doing all those things.
In terms of - we discussed kind of the impact on the companyÃ¢ÂÂs net interest margin or net interest yield whatever you prefer, that is being affected by one, the fact that UK card we sold in the second quarter; but two, weÃ¢ÂÂre growing global market assets.
In terms of the cash youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing on the balance sheet, yes, deposit, we have deposit growth.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre still going to grow our balance sheet in markets.
So the fact that weÃ¢ÂÂre able to grow loans in Global Banking by as much as we have, even though weÃ¢ÂÂve been more cautious in CRE is another indication of the strength of our platform.
Yes, itÃ¢ÂÂs impacted by the growth in Global Markets, but itÃ¢ÂÂs also impacted quarter-over-quarter by the change in corporate tax rate on an FTE basis.
And which business segment, I think, is probably in the - itÃ¢ÂÂs not in the consumer side, it sounds like, which segment thatÃ¢ÂÂs coming from?
Look, we are - the way our securities portfolio works is, we grow deposits and we try to put all that deposit growth to work in customer assets within our client and risk framework.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre buying securities that we think makes sense to balance liquidity, earnings and capital of the company in all sorts of market environments.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs a customer business and thatÃ¢ÂÂs how weÃ¢ÂÂve been driving.
I think in small business this quarter year-over-year, we had about a 9% growth in loan balances and business banking probably had mid single digits, and that shows you sort of the breadth of the franchise.
But the second question is, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen again, looking longer-term going back to the fourth quarter of 2015 something like 160, 165 basis point increase in the overnight rate and the net interest margin of the bank is up 25 basis points.
Look, well, we told you that versus last year first quarter that have been up 12 basis points that we sold a portfolio of higher yielding cards.
Good day, everyone, and welcome to todayÃ¢ÂÂs Bank of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs First Quarter Earnings Announcement 2018.
This quarter, we highlighted over the next four years, weÃ¢ÂÂll open 500 new centers and redesign more than 1,500 centers completing the task that weÃ¢ÂÂve been after for many years.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre expanding those to markets, where we traditionally have had commercial wealth management businesses and now weÃ¢ÂÂll have a full franchise.
Loans on a period end basis declined $2.7 billion, as consumers began paying down credit card balances, following a period of strong holiday spend in Q4.
Liquidity remain strong with average global equity sources of $522 billion and liquidity coverage ratio of 124%.
Global market activity drove the increase under both approaches, but the increase was offset under advanced by declines in consumer credit and continued roll off of legacy mortgages.
The supplemental leverage ratio declined modestly from balance sheet growth, but continued to well exceed regulatory minimums.
Note that the Q2 2017 sale of UK card and the Q4 2017 sale of remaining small positions of student loans and manufactured housing loans impacted the year-over-year comparisons by a little more than $10 billion.
Global Banking deposits increased $19 billion, or 6%, as we grew client balances domestically across all sectors of commercial clients and internationally with corporate clients.
As Brian mentioned, aside from the Q4 single-name commercial loss, our net charge-offs and resulting loss ratio have been quite consistent.
The net reserve release reflects continued improvement in our legacy commercial real estate and energy portfolios with a modest build for continued credit card seasoning.
Our reserve coverage remained strong with an allowance loan ratio of 1.1% and a coverage level 2.8 times our annual net charge-offs for the quarter.
Focusing on net interest yield, it is flat year-over-year as the benefits of broad improvement in asset yields versus funding costs was offset by two notable factors: First, the Q2 2017 sale of higher yielding UK car portfolio; and second, the impact from the lower yielding Global Markets assets.
Compared to Q4 2017, NII on a GAAP basis improved $146 million, as the net benefits of higher interest rates across the curve offset two less interest accrual days.
In the most recent quarter, we increased rates on certain wealth management deposits to keep pace with market-based alternatives.
The increase of $622 million was driven by seasonal elevation of payroll tax expense and higher expenses associated with revenue, mostly in Global Markets, but also in wealth management modestly offsetting these increases or operational cost reductions.
Whether it is access to one of our 4,000 licensed advisers and to world-leading research platform or how we integrate Merrill Edge into other banking needs, we think customers are noticing and giving us more of their investment dollars.
Expenses are up 2% year-over-year as investment in renovating branches and technology initiatives modestly outpaced continued optimization and savings from digitalization, and we continue to make progress on our announced investments in new and renovating financial centers, including entry into new markets.
This quarter customers logged into the Bank of America mobile banking app 1.4 billion times to either transact or shop with us.
This allows us to not only better understand and prepare for customer needs, but also to better manage our professional staffing within our busy financial centers.
Turning to record results in our Global Wealth and Investment Management business on Slide 14.
Strong AUM flows over the past 12 months and a tailwind with respect to market appreciation once again drove strong asset management fees offsetting modest pricing pressure.
Revenue growth coupled with careful expense management drove 3% operating leverage.
In fact, we saw positive brokerage flows for the first time in a couple of years, all while experiencing record low competitive adviser attrition.
With respect to revenue, IB fees were down in line with a reduction in the industryÃ¢ÂÂs IB fee pool, reflecting the tough comparison against a strong Q1 2017 IB fees of $1.35 billion for the overall company declined 15% year-over-year.
Expenses reflect operational savings mostly offset in our investment in additional client-facing professionals to enhance local market coverage.
Results were driven by increased client activity and a strong trading performance in derivatives.
The equity business also benefited from an increase in client financing activities.
Revenue in fixed sales and trading at $2.5 billion increased 13%, driven by lower client activity and less favorable credit markets compared to a very robust prior year quarter.
Noninterest expense improved approximately $500 million year-over-year, due to lower mortgage servicing costs, reduced operational costs from the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and lower litigation expenses.
[Operator Instructions] WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our first question from John McDonald of Bernstein.
When do you think that pressure starts to build in your business sources, because thereÃ¢ÂÂs - their transaction you just donÃ¢ÂÂt think thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of pressure for your pricing retail deposits right now?
And I think this value plus the lack of market pressure so far has allowed us to keep deposit rates relatively flat in traditional accounts.
Is that sort of reflective of that experience that the type of deposit youÃ¢ÂÂre attracting are lower rates and maybe you initially thought and you have a little bit more sensitivity at the short end even after number rate actually seen?
The question weÃ¢ÂÂve all asked ourselves over and over again, so itÃ¢ÂÂs proving very successful, can even accelerate it faster.
And I know a while ago you mentioned processing costs associated with cash and checks were pretty high, if I recall correctly, somewhere around $5 billion with all the digital activity that youÃ¢ÂÂre doing now.
Yes. At the same time, we still have 850,000 people coming to branches every day that need to have highly qualified capable people servicing, so investing in those sales professionals.
We are in a situation today, where securities rolling off the balance sheet are being replaced by securities at higher yields, so thatÃ¢ÂÂs good.
But again, itÃ¢ÂÂs not like weÃ¢ÂÂre out there doing derivatives or doing other things to manufacture a certain type of balance sheet.
You saw the RWA comes down under the advanced approach this quarter, even though weÃ¢ÂÂve been growing the balance sheet in markets.
We - weÃ¢ÂÂve been seeing mid single-digit loan growth in our business segments.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been seeing C&I growth 4% or 5% every quarter.
Is there anyway to break that down between just overall growth among existing customers versus what youÃ¢ÂÂre getting from entrance into new markets?
But IÃ¢ÂÂm just wondering, because IÃ¢ÂÂm going back two years and not just looking at one quarter, and IÃ¢ÂÂm seeing that common equity just doesnÃ¢ÂÂt grow.
",51.82,0.6476656
boa,q2,2018,"It has enabled us to increase returns and support customer growth in a real economy, and to continue to invest through our operational excellence.
In second quarter, reported pre-tax income improved 5% year-over-year, but after adjusting for some select items which Paul is going to cover later, a better way to look at it is pre-tax income is up 11%.
As you can see on Slide 2, credit continues to perform well with a 43 basis point net charge-off ratio this quarter.
When people ask for examples of how all this works, how can you invest in developing capabilities while continuing to take down costs and continuing to have higher customer satisfaction, I think the easier way for people to visualize that is in our consumer digital banking capabilities.
We had a half million digital appointments this quarter, but thatÃ¢ÂÂs still a lot of room to grow when you think of the 50 million customers we have that walk into our great stores every day, so itÃ¢ÂÂs critical to have just both the digital and physical.
Digital mortgage, which is a true end-to-end digital experience just brought out recently, you can see is growing fast; and on investments in the lower right hand side, you can see the Merrill Edge platform growing assets 20% in the past year to $191 billion and 2.5 million accounts.
In 2Q17, we had a net after-tax gain from the sale of our U.K. card consumer business of roughly $100 million, which included a revenue benefit of nearly $800 million in other income mostly offset by a tax cost of nearly $700 million, so revenue was $22.6 billion on a reported basis, down 1% versus 2Q17, however excluding the impact of the U.K. card gain, revenue was up 3% year-over-year driven by NII improvement and better sales and trading results.
Provision expense was $827 million, $101 million higher than 2Q17 driven primarily by the seasoning of our credit card portfolio, loan growth, and a modestly lower reserve release.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 7, overall compared to the end of Q1, end of period assets of $2.3 trillion decreased $37 billion, driven by lower global markets assets as well lower deposit levels, primarily due to seasonal customer tax payments.
If you look at the first half of the year, we issued $3.5 billion of lower yielding preferred stock ahead of redemptions of $2.8 billion of higher yielding preferred stock, and note we have called another $900 million that will settle in the third quarter.
Given a billion dollar decline in the value of AFS securities, which impacts OCI, common equity decreased by half a billion dollars as we returned 90% of net income earned in the quarter to our shareholder via dividends and repurchases.
Turning to Slide 8, on an average basis total loans increased to $935 billion.
Turning to asset quality on Slide 9, total net charge-offs were $996 million or 43 basis points of average loans, and increased as expected.
The increase in net charge-offs versus 2Q17 was due primarily to credit card seasoning, loan growth and the storm-related losses.
Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on Slide 13, another great quarter for this business as client balances grew, revenues increases, and expenses were down.
As rates rose and given our solid growth in client balances, the value of our deposits drove an 8% improvement in revenue year-over-year.
Net charge-offs increased $105 million from 2Q17 as our credit card portfolio grows and continues to season.
Turning to global wealth and investment management on Slide 15, GUM produced another quarter of solid results, nearing the record $1 billion of net income earned in Q1 and producing the second highest pre-tax margin ever at 28%.
Year-over-year, client balances rose to record levels of nearly $2.8 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows, and continued low growth.
Average loans of $161 billion grew 7% year-over-year with continued strength in consumer real estate and structured lending.
Turning to Slide 17, global banking earned just over $2 billion, growing 16% from 2Q17 and generating a 20% return on allocated capital.
Looking at trends on Slide 18 and comparing to Q2 last year, with respect to average loans, 3% growth was led by corporate banking lending in international regions.
Brian, how should we think about the $500 million technology investment that you mentioned in the press release over the next few quarters, and whatÃ¢ÂÂs it mean for the target of approximately $53 billion in expenses this year and also your ability to keep expenses flattish into Ã¢ÂÂ19 and Ã¢ÂÂ20, which youÃ¢ÂÂve previously talked about?
We expect to manage a lot of that through self-funding, for lack of a better term, by continuing to improve of our expenses what weÃ¢ÂÂve seen, so you should think in the $53 billion, low $53 billion range this quarter and keeping it relatively flat, and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to work this self-funded.
So yes, I would expect that kind of a range as your look out the next couple of quarters, and that would reflect seasoning and loan growth in the card portfolio in that number.
I mean, we would expect provision to be roughly in line with net charge-offs with reserve releases moderating over time as we continue to build allowance in support of loan growth, particularly in card.
I want to ask an NII question, and I saw the comments on ex-global markets, the net interest yield being up 12 basis points, deposit betas are good, so the core business that we all focus on is good.
On car, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen mid single digit year-over-year growth which has modestly increased over the last couple of quarters.
With respect to consumer real estate, originations are solid and balances are growing well, but there are headwinds continuing from the run-off from the non-core portfolio; and remember, weÃ¢ÂÂre booking 90% of our mortgages now on the balance sheet.
Okay, and as we think about in that context deposit growth slowing, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know if itÃ¢ÂÂs a large impact from the TRUPS, how do you think about--and your rates on [indiscernible], how do we think about NII growth going forward given the implied curve today?
Yes, well we will clearly benefit from the June rate hike, Q3 is going to have an extra day, and weÃ¢ÂÂre also going to benefit from expected loan and deposit growth, but these benefits are going to be offset by rate increases on deposits.
The good news in consumer is weÃ¢ÂÂve grown number of checking accounts for the first time in the last six or eight quarters consistently due to all the repositioning weÃ¢ÂÂre doing with accounts, and the average balance has gone up and are all checking, so that is very beneficial for us going forward.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been able to maintain discipline on that side and generate another $30 billion-odd of year-over-year deposit growth, which is pretty good, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs all core market share gains because weÃ¢ÂÂre not doing CDs and other stuff.
TheyÃ¢ÂÂll continue to move, but you back that all [indiscernible] you still see the asset sensitivity just under $3 billion for 100 basis point rise, 70% is in the short term, and that takes all the stuff weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about and puts it into the forward curve assumptions.
If I could follow up a little bit more on that lower right part of the funding side, Paul, can you walk us through the benefits you expect from trust preferred redemption and if you are going to have to refinance that, and what would be the net benefit as you think about that and forward NII?
I think thereÃ¢ÂÂs lots of trade-offs consumers make, but this is the money going in and out of their checking account on a given day, so youÃ¢ÂÂre growing the average balance, the $7,500 between our preferred and our retail segment, theyÃ¢ÂÂd be different each segment, but this is money in motion, for lack of a better term, Mike, as youÃ¢ÂÂre thinking about it, so to move it around very carefully has implications if they donÃ¢ÂÂt keep the balances there if a payment hits or something like that.
A little of that on a same expense base makes a heck of a turn, and if you think about, 850 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year matched quarter is pretty effective, so itÃ¢ÂÂs a combination of all those investments I talked about earlier coming true and the efficiency embedded in that, the combination of more sales digital and efficiency embedded in the sales process, because this 48% counts everything, and a combination of continuing to grow in checking accounts and the deposit balances, which are the highest potential revenue growth product forum in the short term with a big business like that.
Yes, but itÃ¢ÂÂs about, all told, I think 35, 40% of the sales transactions are initiated by a marketing lead, for lack of a better term, driven by analytics into the branch system or into the digital experience.
As you know, that modeling includes a 50% pass-through rate, so as I said before, we have some nice tailwinds in this quarter, and going into year end, weÃ¢ÂÂve got the rate hike, weÃ¢ÂÂve got the extra day, and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to see loan and deposit growth, but thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be offset by whatever happens on the deposit side.
I mean, I guess the asset sensitivity--you know, weÃ¢ÂÂve had rates move up more than expected the last few quarters, and obviously there is some one-offs in the net interest income, but it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been a very good guide the last few quarters.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve grown quarter over quarter $660 million, first half of the year I think itÃ¢ÂÂs $1.2 billion on a GAAP basis.
More generally, weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing growth in our card balances and we think thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to continue in 2018 as we add new accounts at a healthy pace.
Got it, so itÃ¢ÂÂs trading-related NII, but what weÃ¢ÂÂre looking at is Page 9 in the supplement - you know, the cost went to $1,462 million versus $1,135, and itÃ¢ÂÂs a sequential increase of about 49 basis points.
Then the usage of it is integrated high touch, high tech, so thereÃ¢ÂÂs still people--you know, thereÃ¢ÂÂs still talent, teammates taking $50 million business to the branch a quarter and doing a great job with them, and weÃ¢ÂÂre driving people to branches for relationship management at the same time weÃ¢ÂÂre doing other things with their devices, so it is absolutely a combined set of capabilities and youÃ¢ÂÂre looking across all of them.
So all that together, itÃ¢ÂÂs a complex thing, but at the end of the day when you put it all together, we made $2.8 billion after tax, 48% efficiency ratio, deposits grew by $35 billion year-over-year, $26 billion of which was checking, to give you a sense, which relies on all those great capabilities to fuel it and why we think weÃ¢ÂÂre taking share.
ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no recently we have to do this - weÃ¢ÂÂve been doing this for years, so if you look back and look at our commercial loan growth, itÃ¢ÂÂs been mid single digits, and our small business loan growth this quarter was very strong and has been for many quarters, as the team continues to drive it.
We break it out for you right there - we have total loans, then the run-off portfolio, then the business segments, and then we added this quarter so you could see the consistent year-over-year growth in loans weÃ¢ÂÂve been experiencing.
Returns are strong and we continue to drive it, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter.
Good morning everyone and welcome to todayÃ¢ÂÂs Bank of America earnings announcement.
Continued solid client activity in a growing economy coupled with strong cost and risk management discipline resulted in a strong quarter of results.
Our immediate priority remains to use capital to buy back shares that we donÃ¢ÂÂt need for business growth, but importantly we increased our dividend by 25%.
This quarter marks the 11th straight quarter where Bank of America has grown its average deposits more than $40 billion on a year-over-year quarter comparison basis.
Here we display the results, and typically Paul will cover these [indiscernible], but I think itÃ¢ÂÂs important to understand how responsible growth in driving sustainable operating leverage works.
Before I review comparative period performance, let me remind you of a few select items which I think are helpful in understanding our operating performance.
Our consumer loans grew 6% year-over-year as clients grew card balances 5% and mortgage originations across both consumer banking and wealth management were equally strong.
Strong year-over-year growth in structured lending with wealth management clients also contributed to commercial loan growth.
Our reserve coverage remains strong with an allowance to loan ratio of 1.08% and a coverage level 2.6 times our annual net charge-offs for the quarter.
These assets resulting from client financing and trading activity generally are shorter term and have a lower net interest yield than core banking assets.
The net interest yield excluding global markets increased 12 basis points year-over-year to 2.95% driven by broad improvement in asset yields relative to funding costs.
Moving back to total NII, Q2 GAAP NII increased modestly versus Q1 as the benefits of higher interest rates and one extra day was offset by seasonal client activity in global markets and seasonal pay downs of credit card loans.
As I mentioned earlier, 2Q17 included roughly $300 million in impairment associated with data centers that we sold, so excluding that charge, expense still declined nearly $400 million or 3% with broad improvements across most categories.
Consumer banking created over 850 basis points of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 8% while expenses were down.
Customer satisfaction in consumer banking reached a new high with roughly 81% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale.
Expenses were down slightly compared to 2Q17 as productivity improvements more than offset the continued investment in financial center renovations and technology initiatives.
Strong client activity and a healthy equity market coupled with solid expense management all benefited results.
IB fees of $1.4 billion for the overall firm declined 7% year-over-year driven by lower advisory fees from a record quarter a year ago.
Expenses were relatively flat versus 2Q17 despite our continued investment in additional client-facing professionals to enhance local market coverage.
Earnings were up 35% as revenue growth outpaced expense increases from higher revenue-led costs and continued technology investments.
Equity derivatives also benefited from increased client activity driven by volatility in financial markets.
Just a couple thoughts to close and then weÃ¢ÂÂll take your questions.
WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our first question from John McDonald with Bernstein.
WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre focused on attracting relatively high quality card customers and then rewarding them for deepening their overall relationship with us, and we think that strategy is driving incremental deposit growth, making our deposits more sticky.
One is as youÃ¢ÂÂve come through all of the regulatory requirements and working through what issues you had coming out of the financial crisis, do you think Bank of America today is better prepared to be able to really fund economic growth as it looks out more than internal?
WeÃ¢ÂÂll take todayÃ¢ÂÂs final question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
",45.63,0.90131354
boa,q3,2018,"We now reduced our average diluted shares by $1.4 billion from their peak and outstanding shares fell below a $10 billion market quarter, which is below the level we started at with this management team in 2010.
The $350 billion of those checking balances have grown every quarter since 2012; they were up 9% on a compounded growth rate since that time.
Annualized net household growth, Merrill Lynch is up nearly 4 times from last yearÃ¢ÂÂs advisors with more accounts.
Net charge-offs and ratios declined from second quarter levels as did nearly every key asset quality metric.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a $3 billion a year pace or nearly a third of our current annual technology and operations budget.
In our wealth management business, we are rolling out a sleeker Merrill Lynch digital platform with more integration between banking and investing, along with adding industry leading capabilities or market data, enhanced document scanning and texting capabilities between advisors and our clients.
Over the last three years, weÃ¢ÂÂve added 103 brand new financial centers with improved layouts and technology capabilities for customers.
NPLs, reservable criticized exposure and delinquencies all declined while net charge-offs were up $32 million year-over-year, mostly from seasoning of our credit card portfolio and loan growth.
Non-bank lenders have likely increased their market share, and companies remain flushed with cash and are generating solid earnings.
Total net charge-offs were $932 million or 40 basis points of average loans.
Net charge-offs were up $32 million from a year ago, as we saw expected seasoning and balance growth in credit cards.
Provision expense included a $216 million net reserve release, reflecting improvement in our consumer real estate and energy portfolio as well as other more broad-based commercial improvements.
The benefit of higher interest rates as well as loan deposit growth was modestly offset by higher funding costs in Global Markets.
Note that we have presented net interest yield excluding our Global Markets segment which primarily reflects our trading-related assets, so that you can see more transparency into our banking activities.
Another outstanding quarter for this segment as client balances grew, revenues increased and expenses were down.
Consumer Banking created nearly 1,000 basis points of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 7% while expenses were down 2%.
Customer satisfaction in Consumer Banking reached a new high with more than 80% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale.
Strong client activity and a healthy equity market coupled with solid expense management all benefited results.
Advisors have responded positively and we have seen year-to-date net household on an annualized basis grew 4 times faster than 2017.
Average loans of a $162 billion grew 5% year-over-year with continued strength in consumer real estate and custom lending.
Year-over-year revenue growth of 4% was led by a 9% increase in asset management fees and modestly higher NII, partially offset by lower transactional revenue.
Global Banking earned slightly less than $2 billion and generated a 19% return on allocated capital.
Expenses were held flat versus Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ17 despite our continued investments in the business, including the addition of sales professionals to enhance local market coverage.
Global Markets grew earnings by 28% year-over-year to just under $1 billion, producing a solid return on allocated capital of 11%.
[Operator Instructions] WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our first question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
There has been a lot of focus in the press on some of the senior personnel changes at the investment bank whether your lack of risk appetite maybe negatively impacted revenue growth?
Each year, we invest probably $0.5 billion in initiatives to help drive efficiencies.
If you continue to deliver that positive operating leverage into next year and 2020, which seems likely, is there any reason you shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt aspire to get to that mid-50s over time on that metric?
If you look at CRE, I think weÃ¢ÂÂve talked about in past quarters we transformed our approach to commercial real estate lending.
CRE is going to turn out to be a great example of responsible growth and how maintaining a strong balance sheet and disciplined underwriting standards through the cycle means youÃ¢ÂÂre going to be able to deliver for your customers and clients when others canÃ¢ÂÂt.
And earning asset yields were up 11 basis points.
There looks to be some noise in other earning assets this particular quarter.
I donÃ¢ÂÂt think thereÃ¢ÂÂs anything unusual in the consumer loan portfolio thatÃ¢ÂÂs driving those.
But, if you take into account your funding which -- borrowing is a little bit more of a fixed rate, as well as non-interest bearing funds, you really have headroom with how far earning assets are going up at 10 or 11 basis points per quarter or per rate hike to increase interest bearing deposit rates somewhere between 85% and 95% before you really see any pressure on net interest margin.
What investors I think are missing is thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of headroom to still kind of trickle up those deposit rates and still continue to improve net interest margin.
The value of our deposit franchise is showing both in our NII and our net interest yield improvement, and Paul is going to take through the details on that later.
Our balance sheet from both a capital and liquidity standpoint remained very strong, allowing us to pay $4 billion in common dividends year-to-date and spend $15 billion to reduce our share count in the same period.
Our commercial loan growth as youÃ¢ÂÂve seen in the market, moderated a bit this quarter, but keep in mind that many companies came into the year flush with cash.
This marks the 12th straight quarter we have grown average deposits by $40 billion on a year-over-year basis.
In addition, Global Banking deposits grew nicely as well and wealth management continued to stabilize.
As you go to slide three, in 2015 and 2016, some of you also questioned whether we could drive operating leverage; with expenses attributable to run-off activities, or were they not generating enough revenue.
Growth was strong, even if you adjust for the lower tax rate from the Tax Act. Year-over-year, pretax income, as Brian noted, reached a record $9 billion, up 18%.
We thought it would be helpful to show deposit growth in a little more detail this quarter.
Secondly, June was down a little over that time period consistent with other wealth managers, for all the reasons that we reviewed in the past quarters around deposit alternatives.
Also within Global Banking, in addition to the growth, note the rotation from non-interest bearing to interest bearing deposits.
In addition to the typical run-off, near the end of this quarter, we sold the portfolio of non-core consumer real estate loans with the book value of $3.7 billion, recording a small gain.
Our consumer loans grew 5% year-over-year, as mortgage originations grew across both Consumer Banking and wealth management, and clients grew card balances 3%.
Higher interest rates and deposit growth also drove the linked quarter improvement, aided by an additional net interest.
For 4 years now, our teams have driven expenses lower every quarter on a year-over-year basis, with only one exception, our efficiency ratio of 57%, improving 400 basis points from Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ17.
This quarter, earnings grew 49% to $3.1 billion, marking the 13th consecutive quarter that earnings in Consumer Banking have increased year-over-year.
With 4% year-over-year deposit growth and 8% increase in consumer payments, we believe we are gaining share and deepening relationships.
The cost of running the business continues its decline as the cost of deposit fell to 152 basis points, while the rate paid remained low at 6 basis points.
The business created more than 200 basis points of operating leverage, growing revenue 4% while holding expense growth to 1%.
Year-over-year, client balances rose to record levels of more than $2.8 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth.
At 2% year-over-year, growth in average loans moderated this quarter while deposits grew 7%.
The big debate is if the economy slowed down a little bit from the current growth rate next year, as many people projected, if it goes into recession, that changes the picture obviously.
So, on the Global Banking side, these are operating deposits that weÃ¢ÂÂre growing.
In terms of how are we growing deposits across the franchise with as little deposit rate paid growth that weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing.
First of all, we are growing -- we are increasing deposit rate paid in GWIM and Global Banking.
We and the industry have not increased deposit rates appreciably in traditional consumer bank accounts.
At some point, rates are going to rise in consumer as well, and our focus is on balancing our customersÃ¢ÂÂ needs with the competitive marketplace and our shareholdersÃ¢ÂÂ interest, and weÃ¢ÂÂll do the right thing.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs been material relative to the start to finish and weÃ¢ÂÂve crossed a $100 million branch for example in Denver within three years, which is very strong, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not material to the $1.4 trillion deposit base or the $680 billion in consumer.
So, those deposits come from the ability to continue to provide better and better services to clients in an investment rate, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the thing.
So, specifically, headcount reductions are due to continued applying of technology, branch reductions, bigger branches, more sales and relationship management people, but less number in footprint and more efficient -- more activity by the customer taking to the digital platforms, digital sales at 23%, and itÃ¢ÂÂs just bringing square footage down in the company from 130 million to about 75 million, continued densification beyond that due to not only reduced FTE, but also the ability to densify the space through some of the work weÃ¢ÂÂre doing in new space, for example, in New York.
Maybe just a quick question on just sort of consumer spend on debit and credit cards, 7% growth felt good, but a little bit of a deceleration from the first half.
I think, the only real question is how much of these benefits are going to be offset by rate increases on deposits.
Having said that, so far, as I think about NII growth in Q4, and itÃ¢ÂÂs obviously early, it sounds a lot like Q3 to me.
As you stretch out into the future, move into Ã¢ÂÂ19, weÃ¢ÂÂre obviously going to factor in the day count as you think about each quarter.
I would think about it -- I mean, as weÃ¢ÂÂve started Q4 and itÃ¢ÂÂs early, the NII growth weÃ¢ÂÂre feeling feels a lot like Q3 in terms of the movement in rate paid so far.
And so, I would think about it as a year-over-year growth being something that feels the same this early in the quarter.
And then, just a little bit related, as we think about the NIM percentage, obviously a nice increase this quarter.
But, again, that increase is going to be dependent on several factors, including loan growth, mix shift, particularly in Global Markets, youÃ¢ÂÂve got the realization of the forward curve, youÃ¢ÂÂve got the competitive bottom with respect to deposit rate paid.
I mean, weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing the benefits of our strong deposit base, how weÃ¢ÂÂve invested in our clients in a rising rate environment, weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing that if you look at the Ã¢ÂÂbanking bookÃ¢ÂÂ.
Look, I think what we would emphasize is given the strength of our platform, given the bankers that weÃ¢ÂÂre adding, given our relationships globally, we should be able to grow loans the way weÃ¢ÂÂve been talking about, even with these forces, even with the non-banks, even with whatever youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing out there.
ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of discussion there, but at the end of the day, we think we can grow loans in the mid-single digits at 2, 3% GDP growth.
So, I think there is headroom for us to continue to expand that net interest income margin percent over time as we see a higher rate structure lock in the balance sheet for a host of reasons, most important of which is the checking accounts in consumer, which we talked about, will always have a very advantaged place.
And if we ever need to retain it, any portion of it is going to be in conjunction with earnings, which are accretive to the returns in the balance sheet, but just between repositioning loans that you can still see, despite all the efforts -- despite 12 years from the last time some of these loans were produced, we still have $60 billion of non-core loans, which continue to run off that we can replace with $60 billion of good credit, which should be another, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know, 6%, 7% growth over the current core business loans.
And to do that, weÃ¢ÂÂve managed expenses well, drove operating leverage 700 basis points for the quarter.
",52.33,0.78790265
boa,q4,2018,"We expect to continue to drive incremental improvement in these businesses as we take advantage of our very strong franchise and the continued investments in digitalization and operating efficiency, as well as our relationship management capacity and core products and services.
In our consumer banking, after a decade of simplifying our products, reviewing our focus on primary accounts, transforming our delivery network, and driving deeper relationship with our customers, we have seen net new checking accounts growing and those are growing with the same strong core attributes of our existing book.
In Merrill Edge investment assets, we had a 21% year-over-year increase in funded brokerage assets and 25 billion of net client flows.
And when you go on to the institutional investor side of the house, through our investments in the business and increased balance sheet commitment to our clients, we've seen an expansion in our prime brokerage business; and as a result, we had a record revenue year in our equities business.
As you turn to Slide 4, one of the drivers of an expansion in our client base is the fruit of multiple years of continuous improvement in our franchise.
So as you look forward into 2019 and consider the beta where the NII can grow, short term rate increases stop or slow, weÃ¢ÂÂll drive what we control with loan and deposit growth, and even in an unchanged rate environment, that should produce more NII.
So we strive to deliver what we control; more customers, more activities from those customers whether itÃ¢ÂÂs loans, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs deposits, whether it's assets under management, whether it's underwriting fees, whether it's trading revenue, we continue to drive what we control and we control the risk and expenses, and we do this while driving our competitive advantage through increasing investments in people, technology, and physical [ph] plan.
Now, before I ask Paul to dive in the quarter, I wanted to give you - we're all facing a perceived change in the operating environment with predictions in the year ahead reflecting a range of outcomes from GDP growth in the mid 2's to lower growth to recession.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10, overall compared to the end of Q3 the balance sheet grew $16 billion, driven by commercial loan growth.
RWA decline was driven by lower global markets RWA and the sale of non-core consumer loans, which offset the impact of loan growth across the businesses.
Global Banking deposits continue to grow well, up 9% year-over-year, reflecting the investments we have made in client-facing bankers and global treasury services capabilities.
As you think about starting loan levels for the new year, note that towards the end of the quarter, we originated several large primarily investment-grade financings, which resulted in loans ending the quarter $13 billion higher than the average for the quarter.
The improvement was driven by the value over deposits as interest rates rose as well as loan and deposit growth and was partially offset by higher funding cost in Global Markets and lower loan spreads.
Linked-quarter growth reflects the benefit of the September rate hike, loan and deposit growth, and lower long-term debt expense.
As we viewed earlier, we grew Consumer Banking deposits 3% year-over-year and the percentage of check-in accounts that are now the primary account of a household increased to 91%.
You will also note non-interest income improved year-over-year from account growth and higher levels of consumer spending.
Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 20, GWIM produced another quarter of strong results, delivering client flows totaling $35 billion, one of the best quarters of client flows in the company's history, which is partially due to growth in net new households.
Net income of more than $1 billion was the best quarter ever for this segment, growing 43% year-over-year.
Revenue included solid growth in NII and noninterest income, overcoming some of the negative impacts of the decline in the financial markets early in the quarter.
Revenue was led by 4% growth in NII from strong deposit growth and higher rates but was offset by the small decline in investment banking fees.
Comparisons against the prior year are impacted by the charges in Q4 '17 associated with the Tax Act, which reduced revenue by $946 million and increased tax expense by $1.9 billion.
And as Brian said, we also don't expect any meaningful change in net charge-offs in 2019, based on our years of responsible growth and our view of the credit horizon.
In terms of where do rates go from here, look I think Bank of America and indeed the rest of the industry really haven't increased deposit pricing on traditional bank accounts appreciably.
Mike to put it in perspective, I think we had $20-odd billion of fourth quarter '17 to fourth quarter '18 checking account growth in consumer.
So any technology adoption, people often attribute to millennials, but when you think about that kind of penetration of digital practice, a 1.5 billion log-ins a quarter, you have 77% of the checks deposited not at the branch i.e. So this is a broad-based trend that we've been driving and over the 10 years I talked about earlier, we had 6,100 branches, we have 4,200 branches.
It's always hard to - our market share in consumer deposits we think is around, I don't know, 13% 14%, 15% depending on what you calculate Mike and it's growing.
But we sort of stick to this model all the things you cited in your opening to your question is the model, right, which is grow revenue a little fast and economy, keep the investments flat, keep the credit risk in check, and drive that operating leverage and bring the share count down.
There's a fundamental resetting obviously through not only the operating performance but the tax reform, but now they're growing forward a little bit, but they'll be in that range, 14% 15% 16% return on tangible common equity then maybe move up higher than that on a given quarter, but I think we're in a solid place right now.
But we could always choose not to invest, but I think if you look at what we're investing in and you'd say, 'keep going.' Honestly as a shareholder, it will be a better answer for the company because the technology investments allow us to take long-term expenses down and things like that.
I mean, if you look at Q1, I would expect NIM to edge up a little bit driven by loan growth funded by low-cost deposits.
But I'll just follow up I guess on the earlier question on your - what a Fed pause would mean for your NIM and I think you mentioned Paul that it really depends on the forward curve and the ability to lag on deposit rates.
But in the consumer business, what is driving our deposit growth is the $20 billion from fourth quarter 2017 to fourth quarter 2018 and checking balance growth, which will always be tremendously advantaged from the perspective you're coming at which is a funding basis.
We'll continue to drive responsible growth and we look forward talking to you next quarter.
Looking at full year results, reported record earnings for our company of $28 billion after tax or $2.61 per share.
Revenue grew a little better than GDP at 3%, and when discussing the growth rate over 2017, weÃ¢ÂÂre increasing 2017 baseline as shown to add back the charges taken to the Tax Act last year.
To enable this investment, weÃ¢ÂÂve driven a culture of expense management as we reduced costs significantly over the past nine years while increasing our customer service scores and capabilities.
Now take a look at Slide 5, 16 consecutive quarters of operating leverage, every quarter for four straight years.
During that four-year period, we have invested $12 billion in new technology initiatives, retooled every single ATM in the company, rehabbed 1,500 branches, built hundreds of new branches, added new administrative facilities and added relationship management and sales teammates, and we've also shared success with our teammates.
NII is up $8 billion in the past four years, but what we often miss here it wasn't solely driven by higher rates.
Average deposits grew more than $150 billion after the past four years at a 4% compound annual growth rate.
We monitor their asset quality and we've seen it remain strong as net loss ratios are at record lows.
This growth was driven by 7% operating leverage and strong asset quality.
Total shareholder equity increased $3 billion from Q3 as AOCI benefited from increases in the value of our AFS debt securities, given the decline in long end rates.
GWIM's deposit balances benefited from market volatilities as customers moved from investments to cash.
Strong improvement in our core banking activities was partially offset by the impact of lower yielding Global Markets assets.
Including our global markets segment, which primarily reflects our trading-related assets, NII from core banking activities grew almost $1 billion year-over-year or 9%.
Turning to asset sensitivity, as of 12/31, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates above the forward curve is estimated to decrease NII by $2.7 billion over the subsequent 12 months.
This expense level includes approximately $1 billion for increased spending in the aggregate in several areas: Normal yearly merit, health care benefits primarily from inflation, marketing and the previously announced new investment initiative spending in technology as well as expansion and modernization of financial centers.
The net charge-off ratio declined to 39 basis points as losses declined while loans grew.
We created more than 1,000 basis of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 10% while expenses were held flat.
The business created more than 400 basis points of operating leverage, growing revenues 7% while holding expense growth to 2%.
Asset management fees were up 3% versus Q4 '17, driven by a solid year of AUM flows, but were mitigated by a decline in brokerage fees.
It is important to note as you look at 2019 that the December drop in equity markets doesn't actually impact AUM fees until Q1 '19 due to the one-month lag in the determination of fees for assets under management.
Strong household growth and continued near record low attrition of experienced financial advisors contributed to the $35 billion in overall client flows this quarter.
AUM outflows in the quarter reflected market volatility, which impacted some clients' preferences versus cash and deposits.
Global Banking achieved several records this quarter across revenue, net income, loan levels and deposit levels.
Compared to Q4 '17, modestly improved M&A fees only partially offset a decline in underwriting fees given the significant weakness in financing fee pools as corporations and other participants assessed significant market volatility late in the quarter.
Our balance sheet is strong and we returned more earnings to shareholders and while the market may now believe interest rate hikes have stopped, we believe we can grow net interest income without rate hikes assuming modest levels of loan and deposit growth.
So just using that example and if you look at charge-offs go back in 2010 I think there were $30 odd billion in the year and a big part of those credit card and related unsecured debt restructuring credit card loans.
I was wondering if you could talk about just your thoughts on managing interest rate risk, given the drop in most parts of the curve, lowered expectations for future short hikes and then maybe specifically the securities book.
So first thing to think about as we look at that securities book we're always, always, always balancing earnings against capital and liquidity.
And we would expect provision to roughly match net charge-offs depending on loan growth.
",49.08,0.720122
boa,q1,2019,"Through disciplined capital deployment after meeting all the requirements to make loans to our customers and support their businesses, we continue to drive our share count lower.
Turning to slide three, part of responsible growth is to produce sustainable results and part of that is to drive operational excellence, and we did it again this quarter.
The first bucket to spread revenue from loans and deposits, and the second bucket is recurring fees, like our cash management fees in our commercial business or consumer account fees or interchange and things like that.
So if you think about this quarter versus last year, our market related types of revenue was down 12%.
However, our laser like focus on expense management came to the table again and resulted in the year-over-year expense decline of 4%, which resulted in the 400 basis points of operating leverage.
When you think about how we're driving the company, while managing expenses we continue to invest in the future.
And we've been driving the operating leverage in each quarter, during that time, but we also continue to invest deeply in our franchise.
Across the company, we added 500 new sales professionals this quarter, more consumer relationship bankers, more wealth advisors, more commercial bankers and more business bankers, more small business bankers and more investment bankers.
Our pace of growth has consistently exceeded the industry's growth rates, customers value the capabilities rewards of their relationship and continue to see lower attrition and 90% plus primary bank status.
Particularly promising was a strong rebound in our middle market customer base, where we saw growth and line usage increase.
However, looking at across our business segments, core loans grew $33 billion or 4% on a year-over-year basis.
In fact, this quarter our ending balances in commercial banking shows the highest linked quarter growth rate in the last six years.
Despite a modest increase in the average balance sheet our return on assets in the company was 126 basis points and improve both on year ago and sequential quarter basis.
Deposit rates in our Wealth Management and Global Banking businesses increased however, we saw minimal movement in our consumer business.
But through loan and deposit growth, and picking up two additional days of interest over the next couple of quarters.
We also typically see less benefit from loan growth, driven by paydowns on year-end credit card balances in Q2.
Across the second half of the year, we expect NII to benefit from growth in loan and deposits as well as an additional day of interest in Q3.
Turning to expenses on slide 12, we continued to improve efficiency at $13.2 billion, we were down $618 million or 4% compared to Q1 2018.
However, please note, that the quarterly progression of expenses in 2019 may look a little different than the past years, as it will be impacted by the timing of planned technology and marketing spend.
Earnings grew 25% year-over-year to $3.2 billion.Q1 reflects continued strong momentum from 2018 as deposits grew $23 billion or 3%, revenue grew 7% and expenses were down 4%, creating operating leverage of 11%.
Investment assets in the Consumer segment, ended the quarter up $29 billion from Q1, 2018 on solid flows and a Q1, 2019 market rebound.
Turning to the slide 16, note the year-over-year real improvement in consumer banking NII, which drove our 7% growth.
Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 17, GWIM results were impressive, particularly given the revenue impact of the marketÃ¢ÂÂs decline at the end of December.
The business created 360 basis points of year-over-year operating leverage as expense declined 4%, while revenue was down only modestly.
Loans are higher by 3% year-over-year, reflecting strong mortgage growth given the decline in rates.
Looking at them separately and beginning with Global Banking on slide 19, the business earned $2 billion and generated a 20% return on allocated capital.
Revenue was up 3% year-over-year, we saw positive impacts from loan and deposit growth, as well as higher interest rates.
The business created more than 400 basis points of operating leverage, as revenue growth was matched with a 1% decline in expenses.
Paul, I was hoping that you cloud clarify the outlook for the net interest income, it sounds like you expect NII to be down sequentially in the second quarter on a few of those pressure points that you mentioned?
But as we move to the second half of the year, we expect to benefit from continued loan and deposit growth, plus another day of interest in Q3.
I think, Glenn what I was saying was that the -- you got to look at the -- what drives the value of the consumer deposit franchise in a company and that's a consumer side.
On the non-interest bearing side the reference was in the commercial side, which because the way cash management services are priced when rates rise people have to hold less balances to get the fees, it's credit rate goes up when rate stop rising, which really has happened that stabilizes and we have seen that and expected that to continue.
Just given the current outlook for loan and deposit growth and expectations for expenses to increase year-on-year at least for the remainder of 2019 are you still confident given the NII guidance and your ability to continue that momentum and deliver positive operating leverage even in the absence of higher rates?
You came in with an extremely low expense ratio this quarter, do you see that more as a one-off due to the fact that the revenues were a little lighter in the capital markets for the reasons you mentioned earlier?
But having said all that for the year is what I would focus on, we think we're going to be at $53 billion in change.
I think, Betsy just to give you -- look for our company and for U.S. economy, especially where we saw some relatively strong performance was in our middle market business this quarter and our small business.
In those -- that's good, because that means the core tens of thousands of customers in the middle market and the millions of small businesses are using their lines and line users went up by a percent middle market, small business, so I think originations were up 7%, 8% year-over-year in the quarter.
Look, the first thing I would say is, again, Brian said it, but remember we're focused not on products, but on increasing and deepening relationships and remember consumers revenue was up 7% year-over-year and profits were up 25%.
I think if you look at the banking book, you can really see the power it's up to sort of 3.03%, which is up 10 basis points year-over-year.
And then just bigger picture question, obviously, not just a concern for Bank of America, but as we think about exiting this year, and we just take everything at face value that rates stay here and all these other assumptions, they'll probably change but let's just hold all that and it does seem like revenue growth is going to flatten out as we get into 2020.
So we feel good just driving out more customer relationships and more loans and deposits and more wealth management business from them.
So I think our ability to continue to drive productivity is really driven by the change in customer behavior and the digital capabilities we have.
But on the other hand, what we see is right now the fundamentals of the economy in the U.S. on a global basis and the fundamentals of consumers and unemployment being low as you mentioned, means that credit is in good shape and we just don't see that changing a lot.
Yes, look I would expect low-single digit year-over-year growth to sort of continue.
Look, I just think it's good economy, and we have high quality customers in our card portfolio and they're taking some of their excess deposits and paying off the balances.
If you think about the last couple years of the economy and the last year and half in economy and commercial loan growth and I don't get the fantods all over that and that the sense itÃ¢ÂÂs things ebb and flow by what's going on.
And so I think what you saw this quarter really a combination of probably three things for us in the core commercial business, commercial loans across the board.
And then the last thing, which I think is good news to the economy overall is the line usage went up about a point in middle market which is -- which means that, that's across a lot of lines obviously, but what that really means is that people are using the creditÃ¢ÂÂs the right word.
And so, yes, the amount we rewarded our customers to do business with us, exceeded the rate of growth than their charge a little bit, but combined with their deposit balances and how they get the rewards.
You saw a consumer deposit level growth of mid-single digits, you saw $26 billion which is the size of a good bank right there, just in consumer.
Asset quality remains strong as net charge-offs remained around $1billion, the same level it have been for several quarters.
Within Global Banking, you will note that commercial customers move balances from non-interest bearing to interest bearing as a treasury credit rate we give them for their balances to pay for their services rises, they [indiscernible] with us, non-interest bearing balances.
This means middle market companies are increasing their loan activity as they draw lines to finance raw material purchases, payrolls and other investments.
However, this net benefit only partially mitigated the seasonal impact in Q1 from two less days of interest, which costs us roughly $180 million.
More specifically in Q2 typically sees higher funding of client activity in global markets related to the European dividend season, which aids trading revenue but reduces NII.
Compared to Q4 2018, expenses are up $149 million, due to seasonally elevated payroll tax expense, partially mitigated by timing of marketing and tech initiative plans.
Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to approximate this quarterÃ¢ÂÂs $1 billion level for each of the remaining quarters in 2019, assuming current economic conditions continue.
Relative to 2018, the business continued to gain momentum growing net new households, which not only added to solid AUM flows, but also drove another strong quarter of brokerage flows.
Within revenue, positive impacts from the banking activities and AUM flows were not enough to overcome lower market valuations, declines in transactional revenue and general pricing pressures.
Moving to slide 14, Q1 results reflect continued strong client engagement in both -- at both Merrill and the private bank, strong household growth in both businesses and continued low attrition of experienced financial advisors contributed to the $17 billion in overall client flows.
But primary additions remained slow and in investment grade we saw lower than expected offerings to finance share repurchases, fee pools in ECM were also down year-over-year.
Much lower market volatility this year results in less client activity and weaker performance in equity derivatives.
FICCÃ¢ÂÂs lower revenue was due to lower client activity and less favorable markets across both macro and credit related products.
On slide 22, you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remained weighted to domestic activity where fee pools are concentrated, within FICC we remain more oriented towards credit products than macro.
[Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
It seems like a steady trend down is that a customer behavior thing or has Bank of America changed anything on how it charges fees?
Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Yes, I mean at one point you mentioned something like $5 billion spent annually on storing and moving cash in check.
Our next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS.
Our next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
I guess my question is this, has the nature of credit cycles really changed due to the low rate environment?
Your next question comes from Alevizos Alevizakos with HSBC.
So those lower intangible is about $75 million per quarter.
When I look at your IB fees this quarter at least based on the results you have better come out thus far, it seems like you've slipped now to number five.
And weÃ¢ÂÂll take today's last question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
",51.52,0.7553858
boa,q2,2019,"Client activity showed $75 billion of deposit growth, a growth rate of 6% year-over-year.
A year ago, I told you weÃ¢ÂÂd continue to drive to regain our position in investment banking, as a nice start we saw market shares across many of the products, and investment bank in the first half of this year.
We use the excess capital beyond the need for growth and investments in our company to buy back shares, a trend which has accelerated and you can see on the lower left here.
Now in the recent past, from offsetting those [rate][ph] fee reductions by increasing the growth in the actual accounts, the number of accounts we have that are primary household relationships the past last few years, we have much higher retention than we've ever had and we're improving client satisfaction to levels that hasn't been seen before.
If you looked at our digital only clients, meaning customers have not used a financial center in the past year, we have 30 million consumer customers across our platform who are primarily digital, who have more than $400 billion and balances with us today.
This quarter we added another 17 financial centers to help drive the growth in our consumer business.
Assuming the economic conditions continue to move along, we think the net charge-offs should remain low for some time and we've told you that for many quarters in a row.
This is not because something we're doing in the second quarter of 2019, it's because the work we've done over the last decade to continue to maintain our risk profile on a consistent basis and drive towards it.
But we as managers you want us to be, agree with you that if there's severe economic issues ahead, we have the flexibility to continue to reshape this expense base, obviously starting with revenue related costs, which would adjust quickly and automatically and then changing our investment strategies.
Overall, compared to the end of Q1, the balance sheet grew $19 billion driven by loan growth, which ended the quarter more than $20 billion higher in our business segments.
Global Banking continued to benefit from strong customer demand, reflecting the additional bankers we have deployed over the last few years in the middle market franchise.
Within that, Global Wealth Management was up $18 billion year-over-year reflecting client growth with a preference to hold cash amid market uncertainty as well as inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds to deposits near the end of 2018.
Consumer banking deposits grew by $19 billion or 3% year-over-year.
Looking at loans across our business segments, core loans grew $34 billion or 4% year-over-year.
Growth of loans to consumers was led by an increase in mortgages, as lower interest rates stimulated more originations, and allowed many of our customers to lower the cost of owning their existing home or buying a new one.
In the second half of the year, we expect an NII to benefit from growth in loans and deposits, as well as an additional day of interest in Q3.
Turning to expenses on slide 12, we have now been pacing at our targeted level of non-interest expense for several quarters, and our efficiency ratio has improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 57%.
Absent this recovery, net charge-offs were just over $1 billion or 43 basis points of average loans and consistent with the net loss of rate ratio in Q1 and the prior year quarter.
Turning to the business segments, and starting with consumer banking on Slide 15, consumer banking produced another strong quarter earnings grew 13% year-over-year to $3.3 billion.
Even as we invest in new markets and renovate financial centers, the all-in 162 basis point cost of running the deposit franchise was relatively flat compared to Q2 2018 as the decline in the cost of deposits component offset the increase in rates paid.
The business created 240 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year as revenue increased more than 3% and expenses grew 1%.
On the banking side, deposits of $254 billion were up $18 million or 7% year-over-year driven by client growth and the desire by some clients to hold more cash amid the market uncertainty.
Loans were 3% higher year-over-year reflecting strong mortgage growth given the decline in rates.
Looking at them on a separate basis and beginning with global banking on slide 19, the business earned $1.9 billion and generated a 19% return on allocated capital in the quarter.
Strong deposit and loan growth reflects hundreds of bankers we've added as well as continued investments and how we deliver our loan product and treasury services.
Looking at trends in slide 20 and comparing to Q2 last year, as you heard Brian mentioned earlier, we have made steady progress in investment banking over the last few quarters.
And given the strong loan growth you guys have seen kind of accelerated in 2Q, is there enough asset growth that you can still grow NII in this environment next year?
I guess the crude approximation is the $3 billion impact over the 12 months of a 100 basis points down rate shock on the short end.
Remember, if you think about the industry's thought process over the last three years basically as rates rose, that was one thought process and how people price deposits and other things, and as that changes you'll see a different thought process take hold at least in our company.
And I think if you look at some of the statistics in the material on the Ã¢ÂÂ especially on the corporate GTS type business that the necessary increase for the highest balanced customers et cetera, that's occurred, will slow down and come back the other way and that frankly is just the nature of a change in the rate environment which the pricing is still catching up to.
And how you know that it's going to continue to fuel that growth maybe something a little bit more of growth coming from current customer base versus new ones, things like that?
What has really happened in our card business over the last few years has been, they continue repositioning it, it's really over now and now you're starting to see it start to work its way up and grow just in terms of balances and numbers of cards and things like that.
Although it still going to hit, but you're seeing that help fuel our deposit growth and checking deposits especially 6% year-over-year in consumer and that is a huge payback for the reward price.
But the industry dynamics and how people are using rewards not only for the card activity but also more broadly as I don't expect to change, but in the Bank of America context we've been using it for the broadest part of the franchise and that's why you see the good growth in the other parts of the business.
I was intrigued by your comment about 16 million millennial customers, $200 billion of deposits and I think that's the first time that you've disclosed that information.
One of the things and I don't want to sound perspicacious in terms of people's use the big banks, don't do business with millennials, it just to set the tone, we put the 16 million to give you [in one sense] [ph], it's $400 billion of client balances with us.
And going back to the comments on the page 6 of the slide deck on consumer strategies, just look of the activity levels and those are generally would have a stronger cohort to younger below 40-year-old people.
But if you look at it with Zelle, the activity volumes if you look at with Erica in the year, 50 million plus customer interactions and if you look at it in terms of digital interaction at 2.3 billion in the quarter, mobile log-ins 1.5 billion.
And also the 2% reported has closed some of the gap to that core number, I guess, as you think about the run down pace, could we continue to see a narrowing, so that your overall balance sheet growth looks closer to that core?
And the last thing is think about in the Merrill side in terms of -- in the private banking side in terms of loan growth we're seeing solid performance there and the integration in middle market investment bank and we feel good.
Brian, and then you touched on this a little bit, but could you talk about your feelings or your ability to maintain the strong checking account growth that you've had given the stance on rates paid.
You mentioned, I know its crude approximation, but 25 basis point cut on the short end, it's about $175 million a quarter, but that's just the banking book and your liability sensitive in your trading book.
When you look at those disclosures about the impact of a 100 basis point shock on the down rate scenario on the short end, remember, that's below the forward curve.
And you know remember when I went through the script and talk about how that we'll still end up growing year-over-year 2019 versus 2018, you get a factor in loan and deposit growth.
I think this is a result of all the things that we said we were going to do, not that we ever had a problem in investment banking, but we think we should be top three and there was a little bit of slippage there.
Also maybe you speak to some of the doctors that are driving more benign impact in terms of the rate sensitivity that you cited versus what explicitly disclosed in the 10-Q whether it's volume growth, some issues relating to your comparing it versus the forward curve, deposit offsets or anything else you can speak to?
And so sometimes people get confused by that because they think its from the current rate and by stable rate environment we see today minus 100, its actually in the case of forward curve having the rest of the year two cuts and its 50 off and then another 100 off.
On top of that you've got to factor in when long term interest rates go down, the quarter later or the month later you're going to see an impact.
But right now, we think 2019 is going to come in a couple of hundred million under what we said, which just goes -- by the teammates here is good management.
So again, the way to think about it, and I'll give you a little bit more detail, but just to get the concept down, we've got GWIM clients, we've got Global Banking clients that pass-through rate on an up-and-down scenario of roughly similar, and we've got a consumer franchise where we have not passed through a lot of rate increase in the former rate paid.
So if you look at the pass-through rate and the down scenario an average we're talking approximately 40%, and again, consumer would be a lot lower, GWIM and Global Banking would be a lot higher kind of in that 60%, 65% range.
Going back to the mobile and digital trends which you're obviously really strong, but looking backwards over the last several quarters, your tax spend has been pretty flat, and you mentioned that tax spend is likely to increase.
And if you think about that, if you add that in the cost of deposit repaid, you're basically flat year-over-year and the total cost of goods sold for lack of a better term to produce this wonderful transaction franchise and consumer and further the loans franchise on top of it and the investment franchise on top of that.
But you think of the run rate exiting 2019 at that level and you can add two more quarters to it, but loan growth, deposit growth, whether the cut comes, when it comes, those are all factors in there.
So I think Paul said, we'll talk about that next quarter when we know a little bit more.
As we look to your -- to your supplement disclosure, then I think we're looking at as a U.S. interest bearing deposit rate going up 4 basis points from 73 to 77.
GUM I think was relatively flat and in global banking, when you have a mix shift, you're going to see more deposits go in to the interest bearing, you going to see an increase in the overall deposit rate of company.
Remember, it really is a question of looking into different businesses, because consumers are checking growing growth 41 consecutive quarters, so that you know that you should expect the trends there to continue like we said earlier in the call were -- were the institutional business in the global banking business.
I don't want to be stubborn here, but you've got to remember that you back up and think about it $70 billion of deposit growth all a hugely advantaged cost to fund all the core customers is what we drive in this, in one part of our business here.
People always forget about that that's the offset to the NII debate with lower rates going forward as the current long term securities you have are worth more and we invest every quarter about half treasuries and half mortgage backs in those treasuries are now advantaged when from the last whatever period of time.
We do not see anything that says, the U.S. consumer and our business is spending 5% more plus than they did last year for the second quarter.
Yes, thanks Lee and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results.
However, we saw in our client base during the second quarter 2019 with solid consumer activity pointing to a continued growing economy in the United States this year albeit at a slower pace.
We generate operating leverage of more than 200 basis points; our credit costs remained low and stable, so that resulted in year-over-year net income growing 8%, and during the past year we bought back 7% of our shares, this reflects the model of combining solid operations with strong capital returns and then thereby driving strong core EPS growth.
In those 18 quarters, you've seen many different market environments; changes in interest rates, economic growth has sped up or slowed down, but we still manage to drive operating leverage for four and a half years and successively.
But importantly on Slide 7, we'll talk about how that impact is now being driven across our corporate and global transaction services business.
Number one, many of you asked, what -- what we see if the expected forward yield curve comes true, i.e. The third question is, okay, given an environment where you may see a slowdown in economy do you have further expense levers to pull?
Paul is going to talk to you about near-term expense guidance a little later, but importantly, the reason why you're investing is to produce these investments presumably meaning result -- meaningful results.
Shareholders' equity increased $4.4 billion as we issued $2.4 billion in preferred stock ahead of planned calls announced in July, and common equity increased 2 billion, versus Q1, the $2 billion dollar increase in common equity reflects an increase in AOCI as the value of our AFS debt securities rose given the decline in loan and interest rates.
Moving to client activity and starting with average deposits on Slide nine, average deposits grew nearly $75 billion or 6% year-over-year.
Within global banking, we saw increased activity for middle market clients, complementing the continued activity from large global corporate borrowers.
First, lower long term rates resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage backed securities, which cause higher write-offs of bond premiums.
Second, Q2 included higher funding costs from growth in non-earning trading assets and other global markets assets.
The lower current forward curve also caused increased asset sensitivity in the falling rate scenario.
Second, lower long term rates may continue to stimulate mortgage refinancingÃ¢ÂÂs causing increased right off of bond premiums, and third reinvestment rates on securities and mortgages will dilute current portfolio yields.
If rates follow the forward curve, and the Fed funds rate were indeed to be cut twice this year starting this month, we think it would likely shave another 1% off NII growth for 2019.
Investment in people included adding more sales professionals, increased merit and benefit, as well as the shared success bonuses which we have awarded for two consecutive years now, since a portion of shares of tax bonuses best -- best over time we are now covering those programs and our ongoing expense base.
We expect increased technology investment in the second half plus the cost of adding new client facing professionals to be roughly offset by the seasonally lower incentive costs.
As you know, the industry received annual stress test results this quarter and once again our loss rates in stress scenarios were lower than our major peers.
Client activity remained strong with loans and deposits showing solid growth.
Customer satisfaction improved, asset quality remains strong as a net charge-off ratio was 124 basis points, decreasing 4 basis points year-over-year.
We continue to expect higher rewards to dampen card income, but would also remind you, that we use awards to deepen relationships with a focus on total customer revenue not just fees.
Turning to Global Wealth & Investment Management on slide 17 strong results were driven by new investment accounts and more traditional banking products, as well as the markets rebound in the quarter.
Within revenue, positive impacts from banking activities and higher rates drove NII higher while fee improvements from AUM flows and market valuations more than offset general pricing pressures.
With respect to expenses, higher revenue related incentives as well as continued investment in new advisors, technology and brand were modestly offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs.
Digital use by affluent clients continues to gain momentum as mobile usage once again grew double digits year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 18, GWIM results reflect continued solid client engagement in both Merrill and the private bank.
This quarter we had nearly 15,000 referrals, two advisors from other parts of the company and advisors made more than 58,000 referrals back to our other LOBs. In Q2 these introductions added 7 billion to client balances in GWIMs and help us grow households.
With respect to expenses, lower deposit insurance cost mostly offset continued investment in technology and bankers.
Fixed lower revenue was due to a weaker trading environment with lower overall client activity across most products.
The 2% year-over-year expense decline was a reflection of lower revenue- related compensation.
On slide 22, you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remains heavily weighted to domestic activity where global fee pools are centered.
Within FICC, revenue mix remained weighted towards credit products and we have no days with trading losses in the quarter.
We make sure that they get executed on the [capital] [ph] success rate, and that energy creates Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs gold in every market every year and this year we will do 7 million referrals across all the businesses in the markets that we're doing.
So if you look at the Ã¢ÂÂ what we're seeing now is the average balance in our checking accounts I think are $7.57 billion Ã¢ÂÂ seven point five thousand, seven and half thousand, seven point 7 some like that.
I don't think we're prepared to give too much guidance on how liability sensitive the trading book is, but when you put all the factors together you kind of get to roughly 100 basis points, I mean, 100 million on the first rate cut.
Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
So I guess, question is like on a stable environment your base case, what you thinking on costs?
And would expect that mix shift to continue going forward?
And our last question today is a follow up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
",55.31,0.614656
boa,q3,2019,"The investments we have been making in the franchise for many years and our disciplined responsible growth approach are evident across every line of business results in respective customer basis you'll see in the materials.
On the consumer business on the left hand side of the slide, our deposit growth has consistently been above the average Ã¢ÂÂ the industry average for many periods.
We have been investing in the client facing teammates in our commercial banking for a few years, and we've increased our investment banking coverage, especially in the middle market and we've added new traders and sales staff in Europe as we opened our Paris brokerage office.
Deposits with our consumers grew $38 billion in total or 4% reflecting the value clients place on the relationship benefits offered by the convenience of our network, the value of our leading digital capabilities and our unique preferred rewards program.
Global wealth manager was responsible for $16 billion of that $38 billion in consumer deposit growth, reflecting client expansion and preference to hold cash and move investments as well as inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds and deposits at year-end 2018.
Since the end of 2015, our average consumer banking deposits are up $145 billion in balances, three quarters of that coming from checking accounts.
Now, when you look at global banking in the lower right-hand side of the slide, $23 billion in deposit growth reflects a rising rate environment and the additional bankers we have deployed over the last few years to continue to sell our superior global transaction services, capabilities.
Part of that is to have sustainable growth, which it means we self fund our investments and find ways to handle the inflationary cost to keep expenses relatively flat, while we continue to invest heavily, $3 billion in technology, new branches, new team mates.
So we've been able to operate at $53 billion annualized expense base, despite increased investments in technology and infrastructure and buildings and people and philanthropy and other costs.
The year-over-year improvement reflects solid loan and deposit growth as well as modestly higher average short-term rates year-over-year.
Offsetting these negative impacts were one additional day of interest, loan and deposit growth, reduction in the cost of our long-term debt and a small decline in the interest rate paid on deposits.
At the same time, we lowered the rates on interest bearing deposits by 5 basis points to 76 basis points, roughly half of our $1.37 trillion deposit book in our consumer banking businesses, where our customer pricing remained relatively unchanged, while the deposit rate we pay in global banking and wealth management declined 12 basis points versus Q2.
However, LIBOR rates have reduced the cost of our long-term debt and the funding of our Global Markets business, this plus loan and deposit growth are expected to partially offset the headwinds.
Our investments in this business continued at a steady pace and client activity remained strong with respect to loan and deposit growth, as well as consumer spending.
Again this quarter, we added salespeople expanded in new and existing markets, renovated financial centers and improved capabilities for consumers, as well as small businesses.
And even as we continue to invest, the cost of deposit year-over-year declined to 150 basis points nearly offsetting the increase in rate paid, which is now 11 basis points.
Strong results were aided by growth across AUM, loans and deposits and generally good market conditions in the quarter.
On the banking side, average deposits of $254 billion were up $16 billion or 7% year-over-year driven by client growth and 2018 year-end conversion of balances from money market funds.
Strong deposit and loan growth reflects the benefits of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years, as well as continued advancements in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services.
In Q3, we continue to add regional investment bankers with a focus on expanding our geographic coverage in the U.S. to match our coverage model and market leadership and commercial banking across the U.S. One of the reasons for growth in deposits and Global Banking has been our consistent investment over multiple years and digital capabilities within our transaction services platform.
The improvement in equities to $1.15 billion was driven by growth in client facing activities as well as continued Ã¢ÂÂ as well as we continue to invest in our equity financing products.
I know thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of moving parts, but given the forward curve and maybe you could also help us think about the premium amortization year-to-date, what that drag has been and how that would play out in a stable rate environment from here.
So, let me start with the premium amortization, if Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to give you any precise number, but if you think about the extra day we had from Q2 to Q3, the increase in premium amortization in the quarter more than offset that.
I think, we have Ã¢ÂÂ if you go back many quarters ago, we discussed -- our thought process is to tell our teammates to price to achieve sustainable deposit growth of 3% or more faster than the economy, which means you are in axiomatic point there as youÃ¢ÂÂre gaining share at all times if economy is growing less.
On the commercial side, the changes of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing and the fees for services and all that stuff, calculations change, but IÃ¢ÂÂd say you should expect us to continue to grow at the rate weÃ¢ÂÂre growing now or faster because frankly, weÃ¢ÂÂve been very disciplined about how weÃ¢ÂÂve been driving.
It gets core checking accounts on the consumer side, core checking and savings accounts on the wealth management business, and obviously GTS business, and so IÃ¢ÂÂd expect it to continue to grow maybe faster, 3%, 4%, and 5%, but the thing about that is Ã¢ÂÂ that is incredible amounts of new customers at very advantaged price and that we can put to work .
So, are you willing to go to negative operating leverage or with the investments like, we have the new sales people in the branches and you had more deposit growth.
And so, if this quarter we are sort of flattish on operating leverage, if we happen to go negative IÃ¢ÂÂd argue, and that was the right thing to do based on everything weÃ¢ÂÂre assessing at the time you do it.
But the real key is back to your Ã¢ÂÂ sort of your second question, which is we are getting the benefits of sustained long-term investment, and the change the way this company operates that continues to push through.
And so thatÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ three, four years out, youÃ¢ÂÂre saying how can you plan out with all the investments weÃ¢ÂÂre making.
But as you think about technology spend and incremental bill costs I would Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be prioritized within our normal $3 billion or plus a year that weÃ¢ÂÂre investing.
If you look across those segments, especially in small business, and importantly in Business Banking and Global Commercial Banking, Ather Williams, who runs Business Banking and Alastair Borthwick, those guys have been investing in headcount and people and relationship manager and Ã¢ÂÂ precise number for each of them.
So I think itÃ¢ÂÂs sustainable and mid-single digits, maybe 6% a little higher, maybe 5%, maybe 4%, maybe 6%, if economy is a 2%, but this taking market share, because of the deployment of the capabilities into the middle market and business banking franchise is along with some of the work thatÃ¢ÂÂs going on now with investment banking and others is a good place to be.
There are some differences to the 10-Q disclosure you mentioned prior, like itÃ¢ÂÂs only the banking book, itÃ¢ÂÂs relative to the forward curve, how should we needle that and think about what one rate cut, if weÃ¢ÂÂre going to model that going forward.
But when you look at them, youÃ¢ÂÂre going to see that, over the next Ã¢ÂÂ but if the Fed were to cut rates by 25 basis points.
But itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a little bit less of that, because again that forward curve includes three rate cuts and then youÃ¢ÂÂre talking about 100 basis points on top of that.
And in fact, there has been more rate cuts and weÃ¢ÂÂre still holding the same guidance of $12 billion in change and stats shows you that weÃ¢ÂÂre managing the heck to try to avoid some of these impacts and how weÃ¢ÂÂd price deposits and better growth in deposits when you may have estimated that.
The one Ã¢ÂÂ it seems like obviously third quarter is a little bit better than maybe expected and youÃ¢ÂÂre retaining the 1% growth in kind of implies, $12 billion for the fourth quarter.
And on the deposit cost side, you did Ã¢ÂÂ I mean obviously, interest bearing deposit costs were down 5 basis points, and it seems like thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be given the limited scope in retail, wealth and commercial, youÃ¢ÂÂre being proactive there as you should, but youÃ¢ÂÂre coming from a lower starting point on deposit cost the most of your competitors to begin with.
YouÃ¢ÂÂre largely around all the CCAR stuff, but ultimately in some of the work we are doing, but really to get all the data rates actually the parts and things that can operate are operating on good data and that investment then allows us to take advantage of it and weÃ¢ÂÂre still in the early days, quotes that we invested in the markets business, so itÃ¢ÂÂs from one side of the company, the other.
The way we do AML, KYC refreshes Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂre going to recognize the team that took a several 100,000 hours out of, several 1,000 hours out of the work to do that, itÃ¢ÂÂs just a 1,000 things.
Yes, I think itÃ¢ÂÂs just Ã¢ÂÂ the third quarter was just a little bit of timing.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre increasing our investment in people in financial centers, in marketing, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not even throughout the whole year.
Our loan and deposit growth, above industry averages and above the market on a conservatively responsible growth basis continues to help offset the NII pressure due to rate changes which is Ã¢ÂÂ which all of you are focused on, it should be.
Excluding that charge, third quarter net income was a record $7.5 billion after-tax and EPS of $0.75 per share.
So, before Paul dives into the quarter's results through the lines of business, I wanted to cover a little bit about client activity costs and operating leverage at an enterprise level.
Our total commercial loans grew 6% compared to the third quarter of 2018 with good middle market utilization rates.
This is the fourth year of good growing net checking households after a decade of consolidation of accounts.
Now through a renewed focus on growth in our wealth management franchise, Andy Sieg and Katy Knox are leading the charge, and we've seen net new Merrill Lynch and private banking relationships, up over 30% plus in each case.
Paul is going to cover the continued growth in digital uses across our client base, which provides an important dual benefit of strong customer service and lower cost structures.
Earlier this quarter, my teammate, Tom Montag highlighted some of the gains we are making in middle market investment banking coverage at a conference.
One additional point we'd focus on here is a long-term trend of deposit growth even in a moving rate environment.
Within consumer, you'll note that strong residential mortgage growth, but also the more stable credit card balances, which reflect our decision last year to continue to manage less profitable promotional balances down or driving core balances and our relationship, especially in preferred rewards capabilities.
Despite the immediate revenue impact of a lower interest rate environment and other revenue challenges with a slowing economy, we have a good track record of generating operational savings, we're able to keep it operating leverage relatively flat, essentially expenses and revenue grew about $500 million Ã¢ÂÂ less than $500 million each.
As I've said before, generating operating leverage does get tougher when we told you that over the last several quarters, after four successful years of keeping expenses, declining and holding relatively flat.
We also grew the balance sheet in Global Markets to support additional client activity.
As positive OCI from lower rates and net income totaling $7 billion was more than offset by $9 billion of capital return to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases.
Our risk-weighted assets increased modestly as a result of increased client activity and higher loan balances across the businesses.
While NII improved in Global Markets, results are better assessed by studying together, both NII and trading account profits as client activity from one quarter to the next can shift in mix between these two revenue lines.
Looking forward, on our Q2 earnings call, we reviewed our expectation that net interest income could grow roughly 1% for the full year of 2019 over 2018.
Consumer non-performing loans declined as a result of the loan sales and in commercial, ratios tracking non-performing loans and reservable credit size exposure remained near historic lows.
The low long-term rate environment continued to generate momentum and consumer real estate as new originations nearly doubled from last year to more than $20 billion.
Consumer investment assets grew $19 billion to $223 billion, a strong client flows were partially offset by market declines.
The business created nearly 300 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year, as revenue increased 2% while expenses declined 1%.
Within revenue, positive impacts from growth in deposits and loans drove NII higher asset management fees grew year-over-year as fees from AUM flows and market valuations more than offset general pricing pressures.
Moving to Slide 16, GWIM results reflect continued solid client engagement in both Merrill and the private bank.
As you heard Brian mentioned earlier and Tom discussed at an investor conference last month, we have made steady progress in investment banking over the past year.
A few other items impacted results here, first provision benefit from the recoveries totaling $200 million related to the sale of primary non-core consumer real estate loans totaling $1.8 billion.
In terms of, but going forward, unless long-end rates fall meaningfully from here, we wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt expect that level of increase in premium amortization in Q4 even next year without significant increases Ã¢ÂÂ significant decrease among the rates.
You had good commercial across the consumer franchise broadly whether itÃ¢ÂÂs wealth or traditional banking.
So, whatÃ¢ÂÂs your confidence in growing revenues faster than expenses over the next year, even though youÃ¢ÂÂre not giving specific guidance, but more generally, whatÃ¢ÂÂs the role of technology inside the firm thatÃ¢ÂÂs enabling this operating leverage?
Yes. But I think 25% more bankers today than there were three years ago, which gave us an opportunity to divide the portfolios of clients further.
I just would point out that we really manage that business looking at total sales and trading revenue not NII.
Is it just that loan growth is coming in better youÃ¢ÂÂve been able to reprice deposits a little bit faster?
On the wealth management side, weÃ¢ÂÂre driving not only the investment cash, but all the transactional cash and you have to think of those as two separate executions and putting teammates investing by putting teammates into the Merrill Lynch offices who can help the client associates and others who have always done a good job, doing better job of getting core checking relationships and mortgages and things like that, which will help.
Hey guys, just a quick one, Brian, you mentioned that obviously delivering positive operating leverage gets harder with their Ã¢ÂÂ and rate environment where it is, but as you look ahead and youÃ¢ÂÂve done this good job of keeping this $53 billion or so, what are the incremental things that become more productive underneath that allows you to fund the incremental investments, like do we transition to other parts of the business becoming more productive or other pieces that you havenÃ¢ÂÂt Ã¢ÂÂ maybe still havenÃ¢ÂÂt yet attacked that could still provide that underlying support.
Our next question will come from Matt OÃ¢ÂÂConnor from Deutsche Bank.
As you think about the overall balance sheet should that grow in line with deposits or are there some opportunities to bring down debt and youÃ¢ÂÂll see a little bit less earning asset growth?
You had good numbers in your investment banking area this quarter and are taking some wallet share.
",45.02,0.74353606
boa,q4,2019,"We also have to manage our cost base carefully, while making the required investments, and we have to take advantage of a strong balance sheet to provide good capital return to our shareholders.
We completed more than $3 billion in new technology code initiatives last year, building on years of investments in award-winning digital and mobile capabilities to serve our clients better and help our teammates to be more efficient.
This powerful combination of Global Banking, Global Markets generated $11.6 billion in after tax net income this year.
With a renewed focus, our investment banking team regained some of the lost market share from a couple of years ago, and Paul will give you those numbers later.
We saw solid loan demand in our commercial client base throughout the year, but that moderated in the second half of the year as worries about global economic uncertainty and all the issues that are talked about every day dragged on.
Client activity remained solid, allowing the benefits of loan and deposit growth to aid in offsetting the negative impact of lower short-term rates over the past three quarters.
Overall compared to the end of Q3, the balance sheet was relatively flat at $2.4 trillion as growth of both loans and securities was modestly offset by lower Global Market assets.
Consumer Banking deposits grew $33 billion or 5%, as we believe customers value the convenience of our financial centers and ATM networks, leading online and mobile capabilities, and our unique preferred reward program.
Global Banking deposits grew $19 billion or 5% year-over-year, and reflected both our strong GTS platform, and the additional bankers we have deployed over the past couple of years.
On the other hand, in Global Banking and Wealth Management, the decline from Q3 and the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, was more in line with the 38 basis point drop in average one-month LIBOR.
Looking forward, as we move into 2020, let me start by saying, our expectations assume a stable economic and interest rate environment, i.e. flat rates relative to the end of the year.
Given those assumptions, we expect NII in Q1 to be lower than Q4, as the benefits of loan and deposit growth will be more than offset by three things.
From there, we would expect NII to rise modestly in the second half of the year, driven by an additional day of interest and continued loan and deposit growth.
We expect our full-year expense to be in the low $53 billion range this year and as long as client activity and the economic environment remains stable, our investment plans will likely remain unchanged.
Consumer Banking produced another solid quarter of revenue and earnings, but was heavily impacted by lower rates in the second half of 2019.
Strong results were led by growth across AUM, loans and deposits, as well as good market conditions in the quarter, but also reflected the headwinds of lower interest rates.
With $256 billion in deposits, this segment would rank standalone as the seventh or eighth largest bank in the U.S. So when rates fall, GWIM feels it, but much of the impact of foreign rates was offset by advisory fees, generated from our industry-leading Wealth Management platform.
Net income was just over $1 billion, down 4% from Q4 2018, reflecting lower interest rates and the absence of a prior year gain from the sale of a non-core asset, which also impacted the revenue comparisons.
Continued strong deposit and loan growth reflects the benefit of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years, increasing our client coverage, as well as continued advancement in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services.
Bank of America was involved in seven of the Top 10 debt deals, and six of the Top 10 equity deals in the quarter, based upon Dealogic data this performance drove a 50 basis point improvement in market share for the full-year.
One of the reasons for the growth in deposits and Global Banking has been our consistent investment over multiple years in digital capabilities and transaction services.
Global Markets produced $639 million of earnings, year-over-year revenue was up 10%, from both higher sales and trading results, and improved investment banking fees.
And then how are you feeling Ã¢ÂÂ I guess if we think about positive operating leverage for this year, you mentioned the stability in expenses while you continue to invest.
As I said though, assuming a more stable rate environment, we would expect NII to return to growth in the second half of 2020 driven by loan and deposit growth.
We are focused on the things that we can control like driving like client activity, deposits, loans, investments, and efficiency improvements through our focus on operational excellence.
So if things change, we'll adjust, but currently we feel our client activity and market share gains continue to support our investment plans in the near term.
I think it's more a reflection of responsible growth, and how we run, how we're focused on the customer, and how we're focused on total revenue, and not necessarily NII or fees.
I think what you see though, if you look at our risk-adjusted margin, that's up 25 basis points year-over-year to 8.7% if you adjust out the 4Q gains we had last year, and we continue to have more than million cards each month again with a focus on profitability of new accounts.
I think, Glenn, just to be Ã¢ÂÂ with Paul's lost point Ã¢ÂÂ production of new customers taking the card product from us and the usage continues to grow, so we had 1 million plus new cardholders.
So if rates stable here from here, then the loan-to-deposit growth, which have been strong will then pick up that, and that's very leveraged to the margin Ã¢ÂÂ contribute to the margin.
So you're working Ã¢ÂÂ it's pretty good to make $0.60 Ã¢ÂÂ 60% of your margin after comp, and we're not changing the comp system, but there's a lot of things forward, and I think we can continue to improve them.
It would appear to be easier or if, in fact, rates stay stable and drive loan growth, which is what our projection is, and if rates start rising again, we will look like heroes in terms of margin, but we've been able to sustain it even in a falling rate environment.
Loan deposit account growth, as you noted, Paul and Brian, continues to track very well.
And I'm just wondering, as we prepare for CECL, does that inform your appetite or your willingness to continue down the same path, and just separately, just given the strength of your credit position and a relatively clean balance sheet, was sort of hoping you guys could be CECL pioneers, and maybe the first bank to provide some more concrete guidance, in terms of day two provision impacts or expectations?
When you're doing $60 billion in deposit growth and your loan balances grew by $10 billion or $20 billion, the other half has to go to be invested somewhere and you're raising this money in all-in costs in the 40 basis points of deposit pricing across the whole board, and a lot of it's coming in non-interest.
Can you give us a sense, as to how you see the rate of change go from here, because we've had obviously significant improvement in the consumer side, and the question I get from people is, is it over and by the way, how do you generate positive operating leverage in global banks and global markets, given the SKU to producers, and is there that much opportunity in the back office side?
As you know though, that's a market price business, so that you always fighting the revenue changes at the same time and in fact, if you look at most of this from four, five years ago, we actually had the same amount of trading profits we had then.
And by the time you get to the third quarter, we would expect, assuming the current sort of economic environment, we would expect our loan and deposit growth, the lack of that seasonality, the deposit pricing to have an effect and we'll start growing again.
How do we think about when, in the current rate environment, the sort of net interest margin, assuming mix is unchanged, obviously it's a big assumption, but do we assume that NIM starts to stabilize in the second half of this year?
I think if you look at Page 9, when you have rate movement due to the types of things that are Ã¢ÂÂ reestablish the reserve levels by the Federal Reserve, et cetera, et cetera that's going to affect the lower Ã¢ÂÂ our markets business in the lower right hand, and banking, stuff like that.
So one of the things that just in our efficiency ratio compared to other people or 58% for the year, but remember that we have a lot more wealth management at 30% Ã¢ÂÂ or 28%, 29% profit, pre-tax margin i.e. That changes that answer relative to some of our core banking peers.
If you look across the chart, Paul showed you when you see 2017, 2018 and 2019 in the expenses per quarter running $13.1 billion, $13.3 billion et cetera, think about how much we've done in there, in terms of hundreds of new branches.
So we're spending that much on technology, but the question isn't spend, Mike, it's are you getting the usage out of it, and that's where you got to look at things like the usage of Zelle, which we're going to 80%, 90% a year, the use of the cash per mobile which grew over 100% a year that usage what I talked about in checks written coming down.
You could, it'd just be not the right thing to do for the Company, but it's paid for by the other Ã¢ÂÂ the cost takeout that supports or the mix in how the customer uses, which provides efficiencies, so more than 50% of our auto loans are originated digitally today.
The only thing that works against that is Ã¢ÂÂ so yes, if you thought about how much is going to sort of new business initiatives, the mobile banking, feature functionality, it's higher in 2020 than it was in 2019 than it was in 2018, largely around this issue that you are running off some of these long-term projects, which is good.
We continue to be well-positioned here in driving market share gains with great service and capabilities.
These savings generated by operational excellence also enable us to make capital investments in our company of $1.7 billion during 2019 for newer modernized facilities and other related priorities.
Dean Athanasia and the consumer team generated impressive $13 billion in after tax earnings in our consumer and small business group by driving responsible growth.
They continue to provide real value for clients through innovative products and services, while driving improvements in upgraded facilities, entering new markets and driving innovation.
Consumers record level efficiency and customer satisfaction scores reflect our hard work done the right way.
EPS increased 6% from Q4 2018 reflecting modestly lower earnings more than offset by a 9% reduction in average diluted shares.
Our risk weighted assets increased modestly from consumer loan growth and increased Global Banking exposures.
Looking at how client activity impacted average balances, let's start with deposits on Slide 9.
I would also note the stability of credit card balances, which reflects our decision last year to pull back on less profitable promotional balances, as we continue to prioritize sustainable long-term profitability.
The benefits of loan and deposit growth coupled with disciplined pricing mostly offset the impact across short-term rates of a linked quarter 47 basis point decline in the average Fed funds rate.
Moving to Q2, we typically experience seasonally lower NII for two reasons; first, we typically see higher interest expense from funding, increased seasonal Global Markets client activity in equities.
Turning to Slide 12 and quarterly expenses over the past two years; at $13.2 billion this quarter, expenses were 1% higher than Q4 2018, as increased investments throughout 2019 in people, real estate and technology initiatives were largely offset by savings from operational excellence and lower amortization of intangibles.
With respect to headcount, year-over-year savings from improved processes and workflows allowed us to fund an increase in the number of sales professionals, as our LOBs added nearly 4,000 associates over the past 12 months.
I will quickly note continued positive trends across deposits, loans and investments, all of which I touched upon earlier.
Digital channels generated 27% of overall sales, 34% of mortgages and 56% of client direct auto loans originated through our mobile app or online banking site.
Expenses decreased slightly, as investments in sales professionals technology and our brand were more than offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs.
And deposit flows were modestly negative, as clients shifted cash back into investments during the year, following the 4Q 2018 equity market declines.
An 8% decline in net income was driven by lower NII and higher investments costs, which outpaced the improvement from investment banking income and leasing related gains.
These investments will continue to benefit the franchise for many years to come, as new bankers deepen existing relationships and add new ones.
Looking at trends on Slide 21 and comparing to Q4 last year.
Despite Ã¢ÂÂ double-digit increases in both debt and equity underwriting fees, led the year-over-year improvement.
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
And just given some of the moderating U.S. and global GDP growth expectations you cited earlier, just trying to think about how we should be modeling or forecasting fee income expectations in the coming years?
So I think that Steven, a guy like me who has been around banks for a long time, the differentiation between types of revenue fee versus spread is becoming harder as the business models have morphed them together in just terms of total revenue.
Brian, 10 years of excellent management here driving the bus on improving operating leverage, especially over the past three, four years?
I think you mentioned a couple of times that NII expectation for 2020 being down modestly from 2019 for your full-year.
I guess how do you think about the deposit growth, and if there Ã¢ÂÂ if we could see continued sort of above mid single-digit growth?
Every business had good client activity.
",46.85,0.87806314
boa,q1,2020,"As you think about our quarter, our decade plus long discipline of responsible growth has resulted in us strengthening our balance sheet and making investments in technology and people and talent over the decade has helped us prepare for this environment.
This included building our loan loss reserve by $3.6 billion over charge-offs and thatÃ¢ÂÂs due to the economic deterioration of the global economy as a result of the virus.
I think itÃ¢ÂÂs useful to draw your attention to the pretax pre-provision income line, as we believe it helps illustrate the underlying earnings power of the company to support the credit costs that are inevitable in a downturn.
Global Markets clientÃ¢ÂÂs needs for liquidity temporarily increased our balance sheet during the quarter by as much as $130 billion from year end, but through the efforts of Tom Montag and team we ended the quarter marginally up.
Small Business originations not from any of the special programs were $2.4 billion during this quarter, showing support for that segment of the economy.
At the same time, we returned $7.9 billion in capital to our shareholders, and as you know, during the quarter, we voluntary chose to suspend the buyback portion of those distributions to share capital for expected customer growth.
Many of our teammates are on the front lines of this effort, including daily engagement with clients, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs in our financial centers which remain open, financial advisors guiding their clients through the turbulent times or the capital and liquidity we are providing the companies across the businesses.
Overall, a couple months ago in a healthy U.S. economy, payments were running at a high single-digit, in fact, in some cases, a low double-digit percentage increase over the same period prior of 2020 January and February versus 2019 January and February.
In total, we saw $67 billion increase in commercial loans due to draws from the commercial clients in the month of March.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs worth noting since we have one of the premier global treasury service platforms of the world, we saw many of those draws come back and our balance sheet as deposits, whether 75% of the loan draws were not used for other pay-downs ended up as deposits with our company.
In fact, itÃ¢ÂÂs the 28th quarter of the last 29 that we have had year-over-year growth at $20 billion or more in Consumer Banking deposits.
Wealth Management deposits reflect a flight to cash in the first quarter, but have been stabilizing last year, as you can see in the charts Paul will show you later.
As Brian mentioned, the team did an incredible job of not only providing our Global Markets clients needed liquidity from a mid-March spike, but also reducing those levels by the end of the quarter.
Before I discuss our forward view of NII, I want to emphasize that future NII results will be influenced by interest rates, as well as loan and deposit balances, which will likely be highly influenced by the virusÃ¢ÂÂ impact on the economy.
As you think about our NII for the rest of the year, I would point you to the asset sensitivity disclosure for our banking book at 12/31 before we experienced these rate declines.
Considering all these factors, particularly the virusÃ¢ÂÂ impact on the economy and interest rates, we believe NII could approach $11 billion in Q2 and then begin to stabilize with loan and deposit growth mitigating the negative impacts of longer term asset repricing.
As you all know, what really impacts banks in a recession is not the loans put on your books during stress, but rather the quality of your portfolio booked during the years leading up to stress.
Our reserve build of $3.6 billion reflects the expected increase in life-of-loan losses, given the weaker current and expected economic conditions as a result of the virus.
However, there were a couple of leading indicators of deteriorating asset quality in our commercial portfolio due to the virus as both NPLs and reservable criticized exposures increased.
Investments supported continued growth of loans, as well as deposits, as a result, our cost of deposits declined to 150 basis points.
At the same time, revolvers draws didnÃ¢ÂÂt happen until late in the quarter and will likely be more fully reflected in Q2 averages of loans and NII.
We generated $1.4 billion in investment banking fees this quarter, a 10% increase year-over-year.
Growth in investment banking fees, loans and deposits reflected not only what we believe to be a flight to quality in uncertain times, but also the addition of hundreds of bankers over the past few years increasing and improving client coverage.
Despite the volatility experienced in the quarter, Global Markets produced $1.5 billion of earnings in Q1, a 34% increase year-over-year.
I know we have been through stress tests here for 10 years now and it would just be helpful to understand how you decided to size the very significant increase in the reserve and how you think it trajects from here?
I think when you think about reserves, you have got to really focus on loan mix and the quality of the portfolio and then you have the added variable under CECL of everybody coming up with a view of the future.
Those of you like yourself who have been around our company a lot, I went back and started saying sort of are we sure how much different we are and people forget things that wonÃ¢ÂÂt mean a lot to people on the phone, the gold option program, which was a restructuring of card debt that went on in the mid-2000s, it started to go into the crisis in 2008 time frame at $25 billion, eight quarters later, six quarters later, something like that, itÃ¢ÂÂs down to 12, half of that was charge-off.
And given what we know, we have earned twice the dividend this quarter at $0.40 versus $0.18 payout ratio and we expect that to continue and that shows you the 100-plus basis points, 130 basis points of excess capital.
On any given time, we are showing them severely adverse cases, adverse cases and thinking through the pretax PPNR capability of withstanding different reserve builds and outcomes and so thatÃ¢ÂÂs what we are doing and trying to keep it going.
Just a quick follow-up on that, Paul, I know you mentioned in terms of the macro assumptions itÃ¢ÂÂs a weighted average, but what you described is kind of a 2Q deep dive in GDP and then continuing negative for the rest of the year.
Is that kind of the central case, is there any more details you could provide on that as we compare different banks and what macro assumptions are embedded into the reserve, itÃ¢ÂÂs helpful to know the kind of the maybe central case of assumptions?
I mean, just to be clear, what I said was, itÃ¢ÂÂs a significant drop in GDP in the second quarter and then negative GDP growth to extend well into 2021, I think, approaching all the way to the end of the year.
But it is interesting and itÃ¢ÂÂs maybe helpful for all of you in terms of comparing reserves to really think about the loan mix, the quality of the portfolio and then, of course, what people assumed about the future.
So our reserve build reflects what we think as of the end of the quarter we are going to have to have in losses for the life of the assets on our books.
So all these factors will play in, itÃ¢ÂÂs just a little premature to call anything, Mike, and so thatÃ¢ÂÂs the factors we are looking at as we look at not only to your point about how you said potential losses based on our customer base and their behavior and what happens to them, but also based on our view of the economy opening up.
I mean, itÃ¢ÂÂs just -- thatÃ¢ÂÂs -- people are -- we all want to see where the end is, you included, Mike, we do too, but the question is we have got to wait for some time to pass to have a feel for that.
Is the -- what I consider the -- not as severe reserve on the commercial side assumption of not knowing the timing, the mix of business or is it where you sit in the capital, meaning even if some of those companies run into issues, your historical experience in the last bunch of years has been actually really, really good.
But that earnings power to absorb pay as you go losses on the consumer side in terms of card charge-offs and things like that or building reserves and then going through on the commercial side, which is what happens typically.
That earnings power is I think what we feel has us in good stead in terms of the ability to absorb whatever circumstances play out here and still -- with more liquidity than the start of the year, more capital than we need, 130 basis points more capital and the PP&R volume that lets us drive through it.
And if you think about that PP&R when you look at the stress test and stuff, we are running a lot higher than the stress test assumed, because they assume thereÃ¢ÂÂs market losses and things like that, which we didnÃ¢ÂÂt experience even in the most volatile periods of time in the markets history.
And so I think as you play this out that -- whether we can all talk about the reserve of X or Y or Z per thing, which is what you all are focused on and should be focused on, the reality is how much earnings capacity you have to keep generating capital and keep generating earnings that you can offset whatever comes at you and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what we feel good about.
The NII guidance, obviously, helpful and coming off a much better than expected 1Q, just wonder if you can give a little more detail in terms of I assume some of the sharp drop is higher bond premium amortization, lower trading, and then, obviously, kind of coordinate pressure, is how I think about the three buckets.
But I would think as you kind of look to the back half this year and beyond, some of those line draw downs in commercial start to get paid off, so that maybe itÃ¢ÂÂs tougher to grow the balance sheet or at least tougher to grow loans?
And then, of course, we have got securities and other assets maturing that we are going to replace at a lower yield and all thatÃ¢ÂÂs factored into our perspective that we think with loan and deposit growth, we can -- you will see NII kind of at that $11 billion level give or take roughly through the end of the year.
Can you just talk about across the businesses, what you are seeing from customers in terms of money coming out of the markets and whether itÃ¢ÂÂs sitting in money market mutual funds in Wealth Management or whether its moved on to the balance sheet and just kind of how that ties into your ability to re-price deposits?
My guess is two-thirds of that was more what you are speaking about a third or so was sort of the core growth building up that we saw coming into the tail end of last year into the quarter maybe or a little less than that.
Another one and small business, the deferrals that you have seen so far probably going to rise, what are you thinking in terms of as you have done your reserving, what percentage of those ultimately may not make it at this point?
Before I turn the call over to Brian, let me remind you, we may make forward-looking statements during this call.
I want to thank my 209,000 teammates across our company for all of their efforts this quarter both in the front-line roles and support functions.
Their role is -- we have seen major disruption in the financial markets that affected every line of business as customers move to stay-at-home status through voluntary or involuntary measures.
We also met our larger commercial borrowing customersÃ¢ÂÂ demands with commercial loans increasing $67 billion, as clients drew down against their unfunded commitments and new commitments were made.
NII finished a bit better than expected at $12.3 billion on an FTE basis, flat with fourth quarter.
We have been there for clients with both upgraded systems and capabilities to allow them to trade, investment office, supplementing 20,000 advisorsÃ¢ÂÂ capabilities to talk to their clients and give advice and counsel, client engagement during the quarter is up two-thirds from last year even though our advisors work from home.
In fact, March ended up being the busiest month ever for U.S. high-grade market with approximately $260 billion of total issuances.
We have also increased our community development financial institutions by $250 million on top of our industry-leading $1.5 billion commitment to these institutions.
We have seen consumer digital logins remain steady as people manage their financial lives on a digital basis.
We are seeing clientsÃ¢ÂÂ attentions turn from securing liquidity to more structured view of their capital position and their needs to better understand how they prosper and fare in the COVID-19 impacted business model.
Global Banking deposits rose $94 billion, which is unusual for sure.
ShareholdersÃ¢ÂÂ equity of $265 billion was stable with year-end but included some offsetting factors.
Note the significant increases across consumer and GWIM, which was driven by residential mortgage given continued low interest rates.
I would also note credit card balances, average credit card loans were down a bit more than the typical seasonality, given the drop-off in consumer spending late in the quarter, while customer payment rates continued at a fairly steady pace.
One less day of interest and lower asset yields driven by lower rates negatively impacted NII this quarter.
On the short-end with LIBOR which impacts variable rate loan pricing, as well as longer term rates which impact mortgage and mortgage related assets, have both dropped nearly 80 basis points on a spot basis.
Banking book sensitivity from an instantaneous parallel drop of 100 basis points in rate at that time was estimated to reduce NII by $6.5 billion over the following 12 months.
Since these rates moved less than 100 basis points, the change in NII over the next 12 months is likely to be less than $6.5 billion.
Total net charge-offs this quarter were $1.1 billion or 46 basis points of average loans.
Consumer Banking earned $1.8 billion.
Results were impacted by COVID-19 through lower rates, higher provision expense and modest fee reductions.
Many of these additional personnel are working from home, while net income declined 45% from Q1 2019, itÃ¢ÂÂs worth noting pretax pre-provision income declined 12%.
Client momentum continued as we saw average deposits increase $40 billion from Q1 Ã¢ÂÂ19, average loans increased 8% and we continued to add consumer investment accounts and saw solid flows into our Merrill Edge platform.
Turning to Wealth -- turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 19, here again, we saw lower rates and COVID-19 related credit costs impact an otherwise solid quarter.
On a pretax pre-provision income basis, results declined 21% driven by lower interest rates and by roughly $450 million of net markdowns in the value of loans and underwritten commitments recorded at fair value in our capital markets books and FBO books.
The loss reflects approximately $500 million for several valuation reductions including marks on derivative positions and certain noncore securities, which were impacted by wider spreads toward the end of the quarter.
So when we weighted the scenarios that produced a -- clearly a recessionary outlook, which included a significant drop in GDP in the second quarter with negative GDP growth rates extending well into 2021.
I think itÃ¢ÂÂs helpful for us to compare across banks that way.
I donÃ¢ÂÂt know if thatÃ¢ÂÂs right or you want to parse it differently, but any additional color would be helpful?
So we -- thatÃ¢ÂÂs why we donÃ¢ÂÂt give guidance on it because it can change pretty rapidly depending on what they are buying and selling for clients in Global Markets.
I donÃ¢ÂÂt know if thatÃ¢ÂÂs the right way to think about it?
I mean, thereÃ¢ÂÂs no question that commercial revolver lines which spiked in March, will start to pay down once economic conditions start to improve.
Obviously, deposit balances also benefit NII because you donÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily have to make a loan.
As the markets stabilize and economic activity returns, we do expect some component of those deposit balances to flow out over time as clients pay down their lines to pay other bills and redeploy liquidity.
Our capital ratio is 130 basis points over our minimums.
