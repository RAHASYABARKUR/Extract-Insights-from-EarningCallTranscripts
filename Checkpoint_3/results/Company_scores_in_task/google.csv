google,q2,2015,"Ruth Porat aÂÂ Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Key highlights this quarter include ongoing momentum in our core search business particularly mobile, complemented by significant growth in YouTube revenues.
These strong top-line results were complemented by ongoing operating expense discipline in the quarter as reflected in 31% year-over-year growth in GAAP operating income and 16% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating income.
YouTube again delivered substantial growth in user engagement globally, particularly on mobile, which translated into strong adoption of our TrueView ad format.
Our programatic business including AdExchange and DoubleClick Bid Manager continue to deliver strong year-over-year and sequential performance then more than offset lower results in AdSense for Search.
Network paid clicks were down 9% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially reflecting the impact of our ongoing policy changes designed to reduce the lower quality inventory on AdSense for Search consistent with our focus on improving user experience.
Year-on-year and sequential growth were driven by costs associated with operating our data centers including deprecation as well as content acquisition cost primarily for YouTube and Play.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.4 billion, or 30% of revenue, up 11% year-over-year and down 1% versus Q1.
Google Play games has added more than 180 million new users in the past six months and continues to be one of the fastest growing mobile gaming platforms in history.
In addition, weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing strong momentum around Google Cloud platform, with a range of great new features, new major customer announcements like HTC and JDA software and our collaboration with Broad Institute.
And on the advertising side as a trend towards programatic ad buying continues, weÃ¢ÂÂre helping clients succeed in a multi-screen world with our DoubleClick platform.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre investing in creating great mobile experiences for people across Google products.
In addition, our teams have made great strides to help users find what they need within third-party apps through indexing.
Alongside our efforts to make mobile better for users, weÃ¢ÂÂre continuing to help marketers succeed in todayÃ¢ÂÂs mobile world.
For instance at I/O we recently announced universal app campaigns, which will let developers easily reach users across Google search, the add mob network, mobile sites, YouTube and Google Play.
As consumers continue to shift their content consumption from television to digital, brand dollars are flowing Ã¢ÂÂ I am sorry following, which weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing an upfront buying through our Google preferred model.
And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Duetsche Bank.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JP Morgan.
On the first part on this online to offline conversion efforts, we obviously know that mobile activities are influencing offline behavior and weÃ¢ÂÂre very busy investing in new dynamic products that help bring mobile users to stores.
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Can you just help us understand or are you seeing both accelerate Ã¢ÂÂ is U.S. search accelerating at this point or is it more so being driven by YouTube?
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
So mobile, CPCs strengthening desktop not declining, YouTube remains lower, but weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing real strong growth in TrueView.
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovations, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Network revenue was $3.6 billion, up 2% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the diversion performance of programatic on the one hand and our legacy network businesses on the other.
In terms of the drivers within Google sites paid clicks were up 30% year-over-year, and up 10% sequentially in particular reflecting growth in YouTube TrueView as well as in mobile.
Our strong revenue growth in the second quarter, notwithstanding the adverse effects of the strong U.S. dollar evidences the health of our core search business most notably mobile, complemented by growth in YouTube and programmatic advertising.
I want to quickly share a few highlights of the past quarter and then spend more time talking about our progress in what continues to be our two biggest focus areas and growth drivers: mobile and video.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre also seeing great adoption of our video ad formats like TrueView and continue to help marketers engage and connect the consumers in new ways.
So as you can see itÃ¢ÂÂs been a very busy and successful quarter, we are super focus on our key goals of delivering amazing mobile and video experiences and there is lot more coming in the next few months including the Android M release, now on tap Android Pay, and YouTube gaming.
As I said in our view, our infrastructure is one of the most strategic assets that we have and as we talk about what happened in the second quarter it reflects the fact that there can be some variability in the cadence of spend and so while overall capital intensity was lower in Q2 than in prior year and prior quarter, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a more an issue of how spend is faced during the year but the main point as we do computing capacity as a strategic asset it provides us with the flexibility necessary for growth.
Omid, the U.S. reaccelerated looks like from 12% to 16% in the quarter, can you just give us a little color of what drove that was it more a function of core search and mobile picking up or Ã¢ÂÂ for YouTube?
We have strength in core search obviously and in particularly mobile, YouTube and programmatic weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing a lot of strength.
And so as I noted weÃ¢ÂÂre just starting the 2016 budgeting process, in my experience the best way to slow the rate of growth in expenses is to work closely with business leaders really anchored in data, so together we can identify ways to prioritize resources and really continue to extend the discipline that weÃ¢ÂÂve talked about.
So starting with your question about cash which Ã¢ÂÂ and whether we would issue debt, I think, the way I look at that is youÃ¢ÂÂre talking about overall efficiency of balance sheet and how are we using the balance sheet and IÃ¢ÂÂve slightly broadened the question more than what you did, but at the end of the day, our focus Ã¢ÂÂ my focus is maximizing shareholder value over the medium to long-term and that is about how effectively are we using our balance sheet where we investing and that could theoretically be a part of that.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs a good question and in fact thatÃ¢ÂÂs one of the areas that I really focused on after I came back and, it is a suite of products thatÃ¢ÂÂs we are very proud of and working well for advertisers and what we like to say internally, as we like to have one Google represented to the customers so that in these conversations with them we really understand their objectives and really in the classic sense of the funnel you know we can start from the brand journey from the beginning to purchase across, search display video and then as you know we recently brought cross-device measurement to DoubleClick.
Omid, you gave a lot of great data points on the growth in YouTube and stuff thatÃ¢ÂÂs accelerated could you spend little bit more time on the why has YouTube seen this kind of reacceleration resurgence in growth.
Do you think its part of a broader industry trend, the weakness in the upfront, offline is now coming online or is what else specifically, what specifically is YouTube doing to kind of better capture those dollars and then Ruth I know somebody ask you about that, logical follow-on question is the cash returns and share repurchases and dividends and just I know its early days but your thoughts on and your collective thoughts, Google how you think about that over the next few years when if ever it make logical sense to do that?
So its Ã¢ÂÂ I think itÃ¢ÂÂs really combination of all of the strength of YouTube coming together it starts with having over a billion users nearly almost one-third of all people on the internet everyday watching hundreds of millions of hours on the services and that creates billions of views and as Ruth mentioned the growth in watch time on YouTube accelerated in this now up over 60% year-over-year the fastest weÃ¢ÂÂve seen in couple of years.
And as I said, the allocation decisions are mutually exclusive, the profitability of our business gives us many opportunities, but the main point is to date the weakest return on investment here has been in our core search business including mobile search as a result of both smart M&A and CapEx. Here M&A, we built a lot of the growth engines today, YouTube and DoubleClick are great examples.
It remains a good contributor to overall results as we announced that the AdWords performance Summit in May ongoing developments in rich and useful ads that work across all screams including desktop, enable us to deliver the right answers for our users in the right moment in other words, ads format that accelerate time to conversion on both mobile and desktop and thatÃ¢ÂÂs whatÃ¢ÂÂs really narrowing this gap here.
And then the second one just going back to the accelerating U.S. revenue growth, it sounds like mobile and YouTube are both doing pretty well.
In terms of overall kind of the framework for thinking about our businesses broadly, I think a valuable framework to use is one that Eric and Larry have referred to for many years, namely the 70/20/10, 70% resources on the core 20% on adjacent areas, one point that included Chrome and Android and they are now in the core but it would include things like cloud and then 10% in additional new exciting opportunities in really sizable markets like Viber or what weÃ¢ÂÂre doing with Google Life Sciences.
So human nature sort of provides a limit on how big that final bucket would be the new opportunities and I think the other point to consider is the GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs core business continues to deliver strong growth.
Well, youÃ¢ÂÂve covered a lot of it, the U.S. growth really reflects the fact we have diverse set of products that are doing well, we had strengthen core search particularly mobile, we had strengthen YouTube and programatic as Omid talked about.
And then the other thing I wanted to ask is just thinking about the CapEx spending made that companies go through and clearly Google been on one on an accelerated spending way for the last few years, should we then suggest Ã¢ÂÂ get from your comments are you were in a digestion period that the digestion period could also be a multi-year trend as well, if there is any thoughts you could share there.
And then in terms of the second part of your question, I think, itÃ¢ÂÂs important to help our stakeholders understand how we think about key drivers of the business and how we manage the business, providing what I call a framework for understanding the momentum in the business, our investment choices, our capital allocation decision making.
In terms of the revenue growth in YouTube, Omid hit a number of them, but we continue to have strong growth there and it really does reflect as he said the sheer volume of users we have over a billion users.
",41.06,0.87799054
google,q3,2015,"I would now like to introduce your host for todayÃ¢ÂÂs conference, Ellen West, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Let me now turn to key elements of our financial statements, starting with our primary revenue sources.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a significant rate with growth driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred.
Google site CPCs were down 16% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.7 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% year-over-year and up 7% versus Q2.
Working with over 30 publication and technology partners we recently announced an open source initiative called Accelerated Mobile Pages to make it easy for publishers and content creators to build superfast webpages for their content.
Another example is the Google photos app, which leverages powerful machine learning technology to help people discover, organize and share their photos.
WeÃ¢ÂÂll continue to invest in large open ecosystems that weÃ¢ÂÂve build with partners to reach great scale.
Advertisers like DunkinÃ¢ÂÂ Donuts and Airbnb are turning to mobile search to capitalize on these key moments reach customers, and create engaging local experiences.
We also recently made search ads in Google Play available to all developers letting app developers find new customers for their app at a great price where it matters.
We are also helping marketers understand how Search ads are driving in-store sales with products like Store Visits which uses our unique mobile location capabilities and is easy for any business to implement.
And we continue to invest in building ways for marketers to reach consumers effectively, like our recently announced shopping ads for YouTube, which lets people shop directly from a video, turning any relevant video into your digital storefront.
In the third quarter, we crossed 1 million paying active customers using Google Drive at Work.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank.
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Can you share with us the way in which youÃ¢ÂÂre approaching budgeting versus maybe how it was done last year?
And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley Your line is now open.
IÃ¢ÂÂm so curious about the various business models youÃ¢ÂÂre now putting in front of consumers, subscription versus advertising versus paper unit like on Google Play.
And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Can you see anything then it maybe in terms of the success with the efficiency that youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in terms of text based mobile ads versus more of the other structured data ones thatÃ¢ÂÂs around like part of glycerin [ph] or hotel price ads and so forth?
And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.
I had two questions that are kind of interrelated around mobile apps.
And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian form Robert W.
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding AlphabetÃ¢ÂÂs future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
The key highlight this quarter was the substantial growth of our mobile search revenue complemented by ongoing strong contributions from YouTube and our programmatic business.
Sundar will then review the business and product highlights of the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth reflect substantial strength in mobile search due to ongoing improvement in ad formats and delivery to better address how consumers use their mobile devices.
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 4% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, continuing to reflect the significant growth of Programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses.
Year-over-year growth was driven by Google for Work, including cloud, as well as continued strong growth in Play.
Specifically, we intend to disclose for both Google and Other Bets revenues profitability and CapEx. By doing this we expect that you will be better able to understand how we manage the businesses, including the pace and allocation of our investments.
First, in terms of revenues are strong revenue growth in Q3 reflects the ongoing momentum in Google with acceleration in mobile search complemented by the strength of YouTube and programmatic.
Second, with respect to profitability, we remain focused on managing expenses within our control, while investing to support the growth areas we have in Google and Other Bets.
Products like Search, Android, Maps, Chrome and YouTube each have over a billion users already, and Google Play crossed that milestone this quarter as well.
Today, I want to touch on three key areas that are important for us; first, making information accessible and useful; then how we are building computing platforms used by billions of people; and lastly, how we are driving growth in our core advertising business as well as new emerging businesses.
We are also seeing strong mobile momentum in many emerging markets like India, which is a number two country for mobile search queries behind the U.S. This is the result of a laser focus on helping users quickly find the right information.
And our machine learning is hard at work in mobile services like Now on Tap, which quickly assist you by providing additional useful information for whatever youÃ¢ÂÂre doing, right in the moment, anywhere on your phone.
Now I want to talk about how weÃ¢ÂÂre building computing platforms that are used by billions of people.
First, digital content, Google Play continues to be a thriving hub for our digital content business, now with over 1 billion users.
Two questions, could you talk about the sustainability of the mobile search revenue growth that you see there?
And when we look, if you step back, overall sites revenue, weÃ¢ÂÂre firing on all cylinders, really strong growth in mobile, desktop is healthy and continuing to grow.
Especially with mobile I think you have a computing platform thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to reach, itÃ¢ÂÂs already reached half the worldÃ¢ÂÂs population or on its way to reach the entirety of the human population in about five to 10 years.
So want to stay focused on that both from information standpoint and a computing standpoint, I think of them as two sides of the same coin, and making sure we are building the right user experience for that.
I think with our move to segment reporting, we look forward to giving you more information next quarter which should be helpful there, but directionally to talk about philosophically how do we think about our approach to the business.
So I think really what was very encouraging for me is there is a framework, a very strong approach to financial planning and analysis, and really building on that to make sure we have reasonable but tight envelope so that we can have the right conversations collectively, collaboratively with our business leaders to assess how we can look at optimizing all of our resources, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what it really comes down to, itÃ¢ÂÂs looking at how to manage the rate of growth of expenses, while still supporting our growth initiatives and weÃ¢ÂÂll be going into more of that in as we go through our segment reporting in the fourth quarter.
Mobile gives us very unique opportunities in terms of better understanding users and over time as we use things like machine learning, I think we can make great strides.
So my long-term view on this is, it is ask compelling or in fact even better than the desktop, but it will take us time to get there, and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be focused to be get that.
So if you take something like YouTube, we expect most users to consume, YouTube debate has been and advertising has been a strong part of providing the content for free to those users, and itÃ¢ÂÂs growing very, very well, but we also see a need for certain users, in certain scenarios be it music or gaming or for premium content to experience it in a different way.
I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs an important part of that we have an extraordinary set of opportunities, not just within Google but across the Alphabet businesses, and we need to ensure that prioritization is a key part of all that that we do.
When we look forward to the fourth quarter, in particular given the hardware launches that weÃ¢ÂÂve done here with the Nexus Chromecast and Pixel launches, a consistent with prior device launches we would expect higher sales and marketing and I realized IÃ¢ÂÂm getting a little more specific than your question, but I think itÃ¢ÂÂs very important to note that there are also certain patterns to some of these similarly with CapEx, CapEx is - itÃ¢ÂÂs been a bit more muted here.
And I think, itÃ¢ÂÂs just, itÃ¢ÂÂs been an extraordinary experience joining this team, I think the with the move to Alphabet it gives us the opportunity to then provide some greater insight into the extraordinary operating performance within Google and breakouts you can see the investments that weÃ¢ÂÂre doing and weÃ¢ÂÂre working very tightly as a senior team here as we make that next step into this new environment in Alphabet.
The interesting thing, weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing is, when we talk about mobile, mobile is a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of his desktop today as well.
But as weÃ¢ÂÂve said weÃ¢ÂÂre looking at how consumer behavior is changing and just as it did on desktop weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing the same on mobile and the notion of trying to make sure were being as useful as possible for users is key driver and weÃ¢ÂÂll continue to innovate.
I think itÃ¢ÂÂs important to understand that ads today fun almost all the services which people use, including products like Google Search, Google Maps many, many third-party products.
And then, in terms of your M&A question, I talked about how did we think of sizing the return, I started with whatÃ¢ÂÂs really most quarter as which is continuing to focus on the biggest problems and solving them at scale, and ensuring that weÃ¢ÂÂre investing in those.
How should we think about businesses that currently are in the Other Bets line that may continue to growing.
Sundar, so I think it was on a conference call about three years ago when Larry articulated a vision of a simple and consistent consumer experience from Google, and the same for your advertising customers as well.
And then, if youÃ¢ÂÂre focusing on the other cost to revenue line, the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth was driven by ongoing data center operations, including depreciation thatÃ¢ÂÂs in there as well, as well as content acquisition costs, as you said primarily YouTube and Play.
On the first one, or maybe youÃ¢ÂÂre specifically talking about the mobile search experience on Google.com or the Google app, but we are seeing the same traction within Maps or YouTube.
And even things like Gmail are playing a critical role in Google for Work and how we are driving big business opportunities as well.
",49.28,0.82270956
google,q4,2015,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
With a move to our new Alphabet structure, we conducted a detailed review of business opportunities and investment levels across Google and Other Bets.
In light of our move to segment reporting, I'm going to present to you in this order: first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.9 billion in Q4, up 24% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs due to the launch of our new Nexus, Chromecast, and Pixel devices.
Given their stages of development, these businesses will have idiosyncrasies with respect to the timing of revenue, expenses, and CapEx resulting from milestones, partnerships, and other factors.
Starting with the Google segment, which includes our Search and Ads business as well as related businesses such as Play, Hardware and Cloud and Apps, as well as our newer efforts within Google such as Machine Learning and Virtual Reality, Google revenue was $21.2 billion, up 18% year over year.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $14.9 billion in the quarter, up 20% year over year, and up 14% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds.
Network revenue was $4.1 billion, up 7% year-on-year and up 12% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of Programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses.
The movement in Google Sites paid clicks and CPCs primarily reflects the continued growth in YouTube TrueView.
CapEx for the quarter was $1.8 billion, reflecting investments in data center construction, production equipment and facilities.
Other Bets CapEx was $869 million for the full-year, primarily reflecting investment in our Fiber business.
We continue to invest in longer-term opportunities within both Google and Other Bets, consistent with our emphasis on pushing the frontier to adjacent areas and moon shots.
Notably, in many ways, some of Alphabet's biggest moon shots are in Google itself, from driving the next wave of computing through machine learning, capitalizing on the shift to the cloud by enterprises, building platforms like virtual reality and pursuing the opportunities we see with the next billion users in emerging markets, you should expect Google to continue to invest in efforts to improve life for billions of people.
We view our computing capacity as a core competence and will continue to invest here given our advantages in providing efficient, secure computing to support growth in both our consumer products and services globally as well as our Cloud and Apps businesses.
Above all, our Q4 results show the great momentum and opportunity we have in mobile search and across Google's range of businesses.
First, on our last call, I shared that six of our consumer products, Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, and Google Play, all have over a billion monthly active users each.
We have focused a lot on really improving search in mobile and now we are investing in evolving this to actively assist our users throughout the day in smart and helpful ways.
We had particularly strong growth in this area in countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia and Mexico, thanks to continued investments in payments capabilities.
Our data centers have handled the workload of Google's own products from Search to YouTube for 17 years.
I want to say thank you to all of the Googlers around the world for their amazing work, from Cloud computing, digital video, and the mobile revolution, to machine learning, virtual reality, and helping the next billion get online.
So looking at the pace of progress, I think we will have AI in a form in which it benefits a lot of users in the coming years, but I still think it's early days, and there's a long-term investment for us.
The story continues to be about strong growth in video advertising, TrueView and Google Preferred as distinct from Display on YouTube.
As you look at some of the numbers, the reason I said it's more instructive to look at annual or rolling 12 months is that there can be some lumpy things on a quarterly basis, but we're continuing to invest across the businesses as we talked about.
And then, on the Other Bets business, clearly, and you mentioned milestones a couple of times, the losses have really increased over the last two quarters.
When we look at the scale of mobile for the first time in our lifetime, so I think we have a platform which is going to reach one day the entirety of the world's population, so it will be over 5 billion users.
And then in terms of CapEx, you've noted the important difference on a year-over-year basis a couple of sizable real estate items as part of our facilities expansion that we called out last year on top of continued investment in our technical infrastructure.
But really to the heart of your question, looking ahead for 2016, we do expect to see accelerated investment in CapEx, and that's to support both Google and Other Bets.
And for Google, that is intended to continue to support growth in our consumer products and services globally as well as all that we're doing for our enterprise clients, as Sundar has already talked about, so CapEx in both areas there.
And then, secondly, Ruth, on the core Google business, we've seen roughly 300 basis points of margin expansion here over the last year or so.
In the near term, given the growth in viewership, YouTube TrueView CPC pricing is expected to continue to affect our overall Sites monetization mix.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. So in terms of CPCs, other than YouTube, I guess, the other comments to add are in the fourth quarter, we did see an impact from the ad format changes that we talked about in the third quarter.
Revenue momentum in Q4 underscored the strength of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth accelerating meaningfully versus last year.
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial operational performance, total revenue was $21.3 billion, up 18% year over year and up 14% sequentially.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.6 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% year over year and up 15% versus Q3, primarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago.
Adjusting for stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 22% versus last year.
Our cash balance reflects the impact of seasonal working capital requirements and our repurchase during the quarter of approximately 2.4 million shares of Alphabet Class C stock for a total repurchase amount of $1.8 billion.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.1 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 14% sequentially and up 12% year over year.
We are working diligently to build additional businesses that create long-term revenues, profits and value.
Given the early-stage nature of a number of these efforts, they are likely to require additional investment prior to generating meaningful revenues.
This comes thanks to our years of investments in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, knowledge graph and other areas.
From providing Internet access in India's railway stations to making Chromebooks available throughout the region, it reinforced what a huge opportunity we have to help the next 1 billion users come online and to have great experiences with the whole Internet once they are there.
Google helps advertisers reach the right customer at precisely the right micro-moment when they are looking to buy something, go somewhere, know something, or do something.
Shoppers turned to their mobile devices to purchase gifts online in spare moments throughout the day all season long, and marketers turned to our mobile ad offerings to reach those customers.
Not only were people using mobile ads to shop online, they also used their phones to find the best products and prices in stores around them.
Our local inventory ads help people see if a product they are looking for is in stock at a retailer nearby.
Our app promotion offerings like Universal App Campaigns, which help marketers easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, Search, and across our Display Network, are getting great traction and delivering results for advertisers.
We also continue to expand measurement options for marketers on YouTube to help them better understand the effectiveness of their ad spend.
Our business collaboration and productivity suite, Google Apps, now incorporates the best of Google's new technologies like machine learning and natural language processing.
Google has a front row seat on the trends that will define computing in the coming years.
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
I was wondering if you could share with us when you were having conversations with corporate customers over the last 12 months, what were the biggest areas of change or things that they said Google needed to work on in order to win over their Cloud business versus, say, them choosing to go with an AWS or an Azure?
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.
Sundar, you just called out Gmail as the latest among your products to reach 1 billion users.
So big picture as you look at the next 1 billion users who want to come online and use your products, are you in any hurry to begin monetization at all?
Thanks for taking the questions, two things.
Our last question comes from Mark May from Citi.
",51.72,0.67803067
google,q1,2016,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
We also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet search as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising.
The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers in areas where we've prioritized investment, such as cloud and apps.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $14.3 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially.
Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in Mobile Search due to the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad formats and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year.
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year and down 11% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset by the traditional network businesses.
The increase in both Sites TAC and Network TAC as a percentage of revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Because Other Bets results aggregate the revenues and expenses from a number of businesses operating in different industries, there is likely to be lumpiness in the reported results from quarter-to-quarter, which is why we think it remains most instructive to look at them over a longer time horizon.
With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, the bulk of that is directed to our Fiber business, where CapEx should obviously increase as we execute in a growing number of cities.
So my closing comment is that in Q1, we continued to see tremendous revenue growth across our businesses, and we remain focused on disciplined investing for the long-term.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc. Thanks, Ruth.
Our teams are off to a great start this year and there is even more excitement in the month ahead as we gear up for big events, like: our annual developer conference, Google I/O; our YouTube event, Brandcast; and the Google Performance Summit for advertisers.
A few highlights from the quarter; we continued to invest in making Search more useful and assistive.
We have made a lot of improvements over the years to add more comprehensive and assistive information right within the search results.
We are incredibly well-positioned to better assist our users, thanks to our strengths in areas like search, geographical information, machine learning, image recognition and natural language processing.
At Google, machine learning is already helping us improve our products every day in search and many other areas like photos, maps and more.
Second, we continue to invest in the best new mobile ad formats, tailored to help users find exactly what they need at the right moment.
As I think about all our businesses and each of the countries we reach, I have never been more excited about how our teams continue to bring this mission to life and make technology available for everyone.
So on the cost of sales or the gross margin trend, as I tried to make clear, certain costs associated with revenue are going up, given secular trends in the market, so in Sites, Mobile carries higher TAC than does desktop and Mobile remains a strong growth driver, so we do expect this to continue.
So it goes to my opening comments that we're focused on controlling the expenses we have, and then there are certain trends, as I noted, in particular on the TAC side, that have been increasing with the strong growth we're seeing in mobile and programmatic.
So on TAC, it's really the ongoing growth in Mobile, as I've kind of answered a couple of times here, and that reflects the strong secular trends behind mobile, so really nothing to add on on the Sites TAC side.
So, Sundar, I think it was at I/O last year when you started to call out the products which have over 1 billion users.
Just a few questions on YouTube; first, on the Preferred program, Ruth, you mentioned it sounds like the growth continues to be really strong there going into Brandcast.
As Sundar said, focused on answers; there are a lot of new ways to search on mobile, of course, voice, et cetera.
And then, Ruth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Mobile Search being driven by improvements in ad formats and delivery starting in the third quarter of last year.
We think there's a lot of opportunity to improve the experience that users have, and that's where the Fiber team is focused.
As I talked about on the last quarter call, we've really continued to refine and enhance our go-to-market strategy, the way we're working with cities, the way we're building out those cities and really the level of technology and innovation that we can use to differentiate the offering and are pleased with the ongoing efforts there.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc. So we've been doing these changes for a long time and so we try to roll it out globally, and that's what we did.
But I think, importantly, we are benefiting from an important secular trend behind Mobile, and like the revenue dollars and the gross profit dollars that come as a result of that, and we'll continue to innovate on mobile and are excited about the opportunity, in particular with all the changes that we continue to see in the way users use the phone and the opportunities.
Sundar, first off, you mentioned a lot of the ongoing projects at Google, but I wonder if you could share with us maybe the two or three areas that you're spending the most of your time on or are focused on?
Our very strong revenue of $20.3 billion in Q1 underscored the great momentum of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth again accelerating meaningfully, up 23% in constant currency versus last year.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.6 billion, up 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with operating our data centers including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and hardware costs related to sales of new Nexus, Chromecast and Pixel devices launched in the fall.
GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6 billion or 30% of revenue, up 11% year-over-year and down 9% versus Q4.
Non-GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 21% versus last year.
The key drivers this quarter were the ongoing drag from foreign exchange, given the volatility in currency markets as well as losses recorded for marketable and non-marketable securities.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from app promotion.
However, the secular trends driving revenue are accompanied by greater required investment in our ecosystem to support that revenue growth, most specifically the continued trend of higher TAC due to an ongoing change in mix within our Sites and Network businesses.
The team continues to deliver innovative solutions that are creating meaningful efficiencies in machine use, allowing us to benefit from earlier investments and meet our growing Google requirements cost effectively.
Finally, in certain areas where we have had multiple teams developing different approaches to a similar technology, we've been evaluating how to rationalize these approaches, enabling us to increase investments around a smaller, more focused set of opportunities.
Today, we show the live scores for nearly 200 soccer leagues across 70 countries, so fans around the world can quickly find information, like upcoming schedules, team news and conference standings right in the search results.
Game developers of all sizes are building successful businesses in the Play Store thanks to its global reach of over 1 billion users.
We recently made it easy to find AMP in relevant Mobile Search and Google News results, giving users a lightning-fast reading experience for top stories.
We expanded Android Auto to Brazil, and Android Wear partners, like Michael Kors and Fossil, also announced that they are working on new devices coming later this year.
Marketers like HBO Now are seeing great results from our popular app (23:10) promotion offerings like Universal App Campaigns, (23:13) which helps advertisers easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, Search and across our Display network.
As companies accelerate their move to the cloud, we can help them automate their IT operations, better understand their data, and become more cost effective and secure, while also offering them transformative office productivity.
It was wonderful to hear executives from Spotify and Coca-Cola share their stories about how they are benefiting from Google's cloud technology, including our best-in-class security, reliability and analytics.
I've been so proud to see us expanding our core products to more and more countries around the world: Street View in Sri Lanka; YouTube in Nepal and Pakistan; new Hindu keyboards (27:58) in India; and a new engineering center in Singapore that will help us get closer to the next billion users coming online by developing products that will work well for them.
Thanks for taking the questions, maybe just two, one on YouTube; you've now played around with the idea of original content, also injected a subscription offering into the marketplace.
Despite the increasing TAC as a percentage of revenues, adjusted operating income margins expanded now almost 130 bps and 140 bps for Google year-on-year.
And the second question, I think maybe for Sundar, can you talk a bit about the decision you took last year to have an additional ad on Mobile Search response pages relegating organic results below the fold?
And your next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
And then the OI&E line also includes changes in value where equity pickups related to marketable and nonmarketable securities and investments.
When you talk about CapEx with the Other Bets being primarily for Fiber, is this a fairly sort of straightforward passing of homes, or is your cash use going toward developing new technologies or products like SkyBender?
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
And your next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc. Thanks for taking my questions.
Were those changes made globally last year in the third quarter?
And our final question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird.
And so thinking through about how computing evolves, be it emerging technologies like VR or how mobile advances over the next few years, so these are all areas where I do spend time on.

google,q2,2016,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
I'm going to present to you in the following order: first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets; finally, I will conclude with our outlook.
Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.9 billion, up 28% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $15.4 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially.
Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in Mobile Search due to the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad format and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year.
First, regarding revenue, our Alphabet structure, announced nearly a year ago, gives us the framework for developing new sources of revenue growth within both Google and in Other Bets in a disciplined way.
We are continually working to enhance the search experience and making changes to our ads formats and tools, guided by substantial user testing.
In conclusion, in the second quarter we delivered very strong revenue growth and improved operating efficiency.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc. Thanks, Ruth.
It's transformed the way that people consume information, and Google's products have become a central and much-loved part of their experience.
Thanks to advancements in machine learning, we have the unique opportunity to take a big step forward for the next 10 years.
You will be able to experience the Google Assistant in products like our new messaging app, Allo, and our voice-activated device, Google Home, and we can't wait to show you what else we are working on in this area.
Second, machine learning; as I said, machine learning is the engine that will drive our future, and it's already making our products better and helping users every day.
We are extraordinarily well positioned to take advantage of the mobile shift, and we are already seeing strong growth in three key areas of our advertising business, Mobile Search, Video, and Programmatic.
More generally, from advertising, to cloud, to digital content, to hardware, and to so much more, we have tremendous long-term growth opportunities at Google.
As you look at this increasing growth challenge on your product innovations in Search, including the recent changes and also those that you have in your roadmap for the next few years, how do you think about your ability to sustain such revenues growth and the trajectory over which they will ultimately decelerate?
And as Sundar and I both commented on, the biggest driver again this quarter was Mobile Search.
Then, as per your question, going back to that third quarter of 2015 when we made the change in ad formats on Mobile, our growth rate meaningfully accelerated.
And as we've noted in each subsequent quarter, that change has been the primary driver of the higher year-on-year revenue growth rate.
As the team discussed at the Google Performance Summit, we believe the changes should result in a better, more useful experience for users and better performance for advertisers.
And as we present our search results, we have long-term metrics for user happiness around which we make, that's the framework for all the changes we make.
Obviously, with the shift to mobile, the user experience, users are evolving in terms of how they use our product.
We also benefited from solid growth in Desktop and Tablet Search as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising.
Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of our business around the globe as well as the impact the currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business relative to last year.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.2 billion, or 29% of revenue, up 15% year-over-year and up 2% versus Q1.
Non-GAAP operating income was $7.5 billion, up 25% versus last year.
Stock-based compensation totaled $1.5 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased head count and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs every two years.
The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud and apps.
This performance reflects our strong operating cash flow, offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $1.6 billion, completing the authorization under our share repurchase program.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and increasingly Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager.
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year on year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset by the traditional Network businesses.
The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely Mobile Search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
You've seen over the past few quarters how our focus on innovation can drive strong revenue growth.
Second, as to expenses, I've commented many times that our focus on long-term revenue growth does not give us a pass on managing expenses.
We invest a lot of time and effort in assessing how to manage for revenue growth with the utmost respect for the resources deployed and a focus on getting the best return on those resources, recognizing that in some areas secular trends are creating margin headwinds.
When looking at Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue, it's important also to remember that while YouTube advertising revenue is reflected in our Sites line, the associated content acquisition costs are included in other cost of revenues, not TAC.
Third, regarding CapEx, at Google the team has been able to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure, which has enabled us to support growing demand at a stable investment level.
And then I'll call out three key highlights from the quarter that are driving our advertising business today and into the future.
And after just one year, Google Photos is now helping over 200 million people every month organize and search their photos and memories.
Fourth, platforms; a key focus is building great computing platforms like Chrome, Android, and our new virtual reality platform, Daydream, so that people can have wonderful experiences regardless of the device or stream they are using.
So let me turn to three key moments from the quarter for our advertising business, number one, our Google Performance Summit for direct response marketers.
This creates even greater opportunity for businesses to use Google Maps to help bring customers into their physical store locations.
Thanks to our strong intent signals, particularly on mobile, Google continues to offer great opportunities for direct response marketers to reach potential customers, whether they are visiting your website, calling your business, walking into your store, or downloading your app.
The ability to advertise against fast-rising videos on YouTube as well as a deal with the NBA to bring their inventory to Google Preferred.
Today's great innovations are being driven by investments in Mobile.
I want to thank all the Googlers around the world who help us create these opportunities every day and help bring them to life for our users and partners.
I'll let you do your own forecasting, but when comparing growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year.
How should we think about the roadmap ahead for both increased user engagement with your product in those key verticals as well as the ability for advertiser conversion to lead to more advertising budgets for the company over the medium to long term?
And then maybe one second question would be, with the buyback authorization having been completed this quarter, Ruth, I would love to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about the balance sheet as an asset and how shareholders should think about the ability for shareholder returns over the medium and long term.
So you spent a lot of time talking about how this is positively impacting Google as a whole and how you're building for the future, both tonight and at I/O a few months ago.
But are there tangible examples of either engagement or volume also increasing as you roll out machine learning in Search and in YouTube that you could share?
And then, I think Google recently introduced Smart Bidding in AdWords using machine learning.
So we definitely Ã¢ÂÂ a core part of improving the user experience for the next many years will be driven by machine learning.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
So for people who choose to opt in, over time we could make sure they see more relevant ads and fewer annoying ones, so effectively put them in better control of the experience they get, and so I think that helps the whole ecosystem work better.
And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird.
Why has that been so successful recently, and do you look at that as an incremental forward driver of YouTube revenue growth?
With respect to consumers, we continue to invest in innovative opportunities that create great experiences and improve their lives.
Can you help us all think about what the level of engagement is on YouTube right now, whether it's minutes or maybe growth in images?
",52.33,0.93538785
google,q3,2016,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Most notably, Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business as well as the enormous opportunity in this area.
Relative to last year, we have an expanded portfolio of hardware products, and therefore expect marketing costs to increase in the fourth quarter to support the line.
We unveiled a beautiful lineup of new hardware devices, including Google Home and the Pixel phone, which is getting great reviews.
We reached an important milestone in that journey this quarter with the launch of the Google Assistant, which allows you to type or talk with Google in a natural conversational way to help you get things done regardless of the device you're using.
Second, moving to our efforts to bring more content to more places, key to making information accessible is helping people find more great content across platforms like the web, YouTube, and Google Play.
We also think there's an opportunity for us to more deeply integrate software and hardware together to deliver great experiences that we hope will also contribute to future innovation and development of the ecosystem.
Last month at our Horizon event, we introduced a new business unit, Google Cloud, our unique and broad portfolio of products and services that let our customers operate easily in a digital world with the performance they demand.
Our investments in machine learning continue to be a very clear advantage for Google Cloud, and we are helping customers apply ML in very concrete ways.
Our mobile properties like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Google Play are where people turn when they are actively interested in something.
I think one of the big questions we get from investors all the time are where are the key areas you need to invest going forward in both capabilities, go-to-market, and how those might evolve over the next couple years.
And then, Ruth, the second question is just on Ã¢ÂÂ core operating margins for Google have declined a little bit versus the prior quarter trend of increasing.
Ross, on the first question, I would say overall when I look across Google and Alphabet, the number of areas where we have been able to build world-class products and achieve scale and success, we today have over seven products which serve 1 billion users each, so I think our track record speaks there.
I think one of the core things to your question is just how we're looking at it, and our view continues to be that given the breadth of opportunities and our commitment to long-term revenue growth, as we've talked about, quarter after quarter we do remain committed to investing in this growing set of opportunities.
So along those lines, both Google Home in Google Pixel are important new efforts for us, and I think we will thoughtfully evolve our go-to-market strategy as well.
And you already see with Google Pixel we have a deep partnership at Verizon with which we are going to market in the U.S. And so we are constantly thinking about how to do this well, and you will see new approaches as we go through it more.
And as we evolve the Google Assistant, I think voice is going to play a major role that way as well.
I think the only thing to point out is that in looking at growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year, so that to us is an important point.
And things like the Google Assistant are a manifestation of that, and you will see us continue to stay focused and innovate that way.
And what's important to note is that's not only good for Google products generally, but it's also valuable to our cloud offering for our enterprise customers.
So that's the way we think about Google Cloud.
We want to make sure that all these new capabilities for machine learning and AI are available through Google Cloud to all our partners.
But could you talk about machine learning in search and how much it's making a difference over the past few quarters and how much you still have to go, how important that is to revenues?
And then, Ruth, a couple questions, any thoughts on whether hardware sales could make a difference to margins going forward, and also on the stock-based comp, how Google thinks about that expense internally?
While you've been waiting for the call to start, you've been listening to Dua Lipa, a rising new pop star from London, whose most recent single on YouTube has found fans all over the world and cracked the top 40 in the U.S. ahead of her debut album release early next year.
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance, total revenue was $22.5 billion, up 20% year over year and up 4% sequentially.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $4.2 billion, up 29% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.
GAAP operating expenses were $8 billion in the quarter, up 15% year over year.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.5 billion, up 13% year over year.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.8 billion, up 22% versus last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $7.6 billion, up 24% versus last year.
Stock-based compensation [SBC] totaled $1.9 billion, up 30% year over year and up 24% sequentially, primarily reflecting the step-up from our annual equity refresh for employees at the start of Q3.
Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud.
Total traffic acquisition costs [TAC] were $4.2 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 17% year over year and up 5% sequentially.
Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 28% year over year.
Turning to Other Bets, as we said previously, we think it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon because, as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary reasons.
Within Google, this relentless focus has led to innovations across our advertising platforms that have driven continued strong growth on a very large base, while at the same time we're building new businesses to serve as sources of future revenue growth.
Before moving on from expenses, one reminder regarding the fourth quarter; as discussed in prior years, our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season.
Third regarding CapEx, at Google the team continues to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure.
Today I want to walk through our progress across Google's key focus areas and the success of our growing advertising business.
Third, powerful computing platforms and hardware; we have long been committed to building powerful computing platforms like Android, Chrome, and now Daydream in VR, so that people can have great experiences regardless of their device.
We announced an enhanced media conference experience in Google Hangouts with an updated user interface, instant screen sharing, support for 50 participants, and a seamless integration into Calendar.
For instance, hotel chain La Quinta now sees a third of their website traffic coming from mobile, and they use our hotel ads to help them reach travelers right when they are looking for hotel stays.
They have found conversion rates to be twice as high with hotel ads compared to regular mobile traffic, which is helping them capitalize on those prime time moments when travelers are on their phones and ready to book.
We also recently announced expanded capabilities to show marketers how TV and YouTube campaigns increase Google and YouTube searches for their brand.
We introduced even more measurement solutions at this year's Advertising Week in New York, helping marketers close the loop with newer tools like location extensions and store visits measurements for the Google Display Network.
I'm really pleased with how our business teams are working closer than ever with their advertising partners, agencies, marketers, and publishers.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. So do you think this structure is ideal for entire companies, or is it just new products and new technologies that you see as the vision here for Alphabet long term?
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Google over the years has put out different hardware products.
And the thing which helps us deliver a great local search experience is Maps.
And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities.
In terms of your second question around expanded text ads, I would say again it's early.
So as you think about what your product portfolio might look like over the next five years or even the next decade, does the Pixel phone market change in direction for Google to become maybe more of an integrated software and hardware company?
And our final question comes from the line of Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.

google,q4,2016,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.
A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release.
Advertising revenue growth was driven by Mobile Search with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $5.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses; specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers including depreciation and content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube as well as hardware.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $8.5 billion, up 24% versus last year.
Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as Cloud including the addition of employees from our Apigee acquisition.
Our effective tax rate was 22% for the fourth quarter reflecting the geographic mix of earnings and certain discrete items affecting our U.S. rate.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView including buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager.
Network revenue was $4.4 billion, up 7% year-on-year reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob offset by the traditional network businesses.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.9 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.
Starting with our first quarter results for 2017, we will no longer regularly exclude stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP results.
Noncash stock-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits.
This quarter was about the business firing on all cylinders and terrific progress across Google's newer areas of investment.
We routinely hear from customers that we have now moved well beyond table stakes, and we have truly differentiated offerings in four key areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy, tools for application development, and the ability to create connected business platforms, leveraging our recent acquisition of Apigee.
Our product advancements across all of GCP, in addition to our increased focus on how we work with the enterprise customers, have enabled us to accelerate growth with new Fortune 2000 customers while also inspiring our current customers to substantially expand their use of GCP.
Our increased success with enterprise customers relates to the unparalleled security and data protection we can provide by offering an entirely cloud-based solution that enables an extremely strong level of production.
This will work alongside our Firebase platform to help developers build better apps and grow their businesses.
Play had a great quarter with continued growth in our top markets, as well as in emerging markets where user spend grew by more than 70% year-over-year in countries like India, Mexico, Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
Second, we saw this season that measurement really matters, and advertisers want reliable ways of understanding where their sales and traffic are coming from and how their campaigns are working.
We saw increased use of our popular store visits technology over the holiday shopping season, helping businesses understand how online ads bring customers into their physical stores.
In less than two years, store visits have helped advertisers measure over 3 billion store visits globally.
Air France used YouTube's TrueView video ads in order to reach valuable business travelers and new customers around the world.
Would it be possible to get any sort of metrics around YouTube Red and how the subscription business has been progressing, realizing you're not going to be providing that every quarter but that you do occasionally give us some sort of benchmarks in the market?
I'd be curious to hear about how you think philosophically about partnering with more premium content players to maybe drive even higher engagement and an even better YouTube experience.
But I do think as part of these changes, advertisers can get more detailed insights from their YouTube campaigns across devices so they can better understand the impact of their marketing campaigns.
I wonder what's happening seasonally to that revenue line that drives fourth quarter up so much.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Wondering, Sundar, if you can just give us a sense on the Pixel phone hardware opportunity to kind of build direct mobile distribution and capture hardware margin, and how you think about that versus the potential disruption that having your own handset at a bigger scale could cause in the Android ecosystem?
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Operator
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Other revenue for Google was $3.4 billion, up 62% year-over-year with strong performance from each of hardware, Play and Cloud.
In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis, reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and Cloud businesses.
We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube.
We're investing in our Cloud and hardware businesses as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years.
Second, I want to talk about three of our biggest bets, YouTube, Cloud and hardware, where we are making great progress.
We had more than 350 launches powered by machine learning across areas like search, maps, messaging and Google Play.
And last quarter, the team announced new alliances including Intel, Improbable, Slack, Pivotal and Red Hat. We look forward to showcasing customers, partners and all of Google Cloud at our next annual Next user conference in March.
We are committed to this for the long-term as a great way to bring a beautiful seamless Google experience to people.
We will also continue working closely with our ecosystem partners to create the best experiences for our users.
Building powerful open platforms has always been core to Google and our platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream are creating more innovation, more choice for users and more opportunities for partners.
CES is just a start and there's a lot more coming from our great partners across these platforms in 2017, and we'll continue working hand-in-hand with them to provide the best experiences for our users.
Our mobile properties like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Google Play are where people turn when they are actively engaged.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions.
The momentum when we look at the numbers internally and as well as the traction we see in competitive situations, I definitely think we are going to have a great year and hopefully in the next conference coming up, Diane and team will share a lot more details.
Now that you have this breadth of device ecosystem out there into the marketplace, wanted to know if we get a little bit more color around what your learnings are about the adoption of the device ecosystem, how you're thinking about the go-to-market strategy over the medium to long-term and how we might see sort of an evolution across operating systems?
We expect to be there for users across a device ecosystem, and we're also building things like Google Play to work across all of this so that users can have one coherent experience.
I think we see great momentum both across our partner ecosystem, as well as pushing the cutting edge of the experience which is what we strive to do with our own hardware devices.
And the challenge I'll throw to you is, it looks to me like Google devices are being outsold ten-to-one or something like that in most Ã¢ÂÂ in a lot of homes, and it's immaterial now, but it could see in five years that there's is a new Voice Search interaction interface and it's not Google in the home.
So we are thinking about it across phones, homes, TVs, cars, and trying to drive that ecosystem that way, and we want Google to be there for users when they need it.
When I look at what it would take to Voice Search well, our years of progress we have done in areas like natural language processing comes into play, and I think there's a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users.
And then just to follow up on Mark's question on Voice Search, I understand, Sundar, it's early, but how do you think about the challenges and opportunities from a monetization perspective in Voice?
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. So on the first question in terms of YouTube, Sundar elaborated on my opening comments.
And really the point I was trying to stress consistent with Sundar's comments is, we've got the non-ads momentum here on the YouTube side, and we're also seeing tremendous momentum with cloud, which we're excited about, and the hardware and investing behind those.
And, Doug, I mean, just like Mark's question on Voice Search, I would encourage you to think about it as from a user standpoint, they are looking for information, looking to get things done.
So they may ask a question on voice, later when they pick up their phone, they want continuity, so we think of this as an end-to-end thing.
Look, I mean, I think Ã¢ÂÂ I would think about it as, we are investing a lot in developing this premium experience in a way of YouTube Brand, YouTube Music, and we do offer it across Google Play Music as well.
On your first question, look, I mean, we think of YouTube again as an ecosystem.
And when you're looking at the quarter-over-quarter, we are continuing to see things like the impact of policy changes and timing of product launches.
In terms of Google Assistant on the Pixel along with how search works, I think definitely it gives us a way to iterate and move faster and make sure it's working better for users.

Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions.
APAC revenues were $3.6 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 26% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strength of the Australian dollar and yen.
Other Americas revenues, which include results from Canada and Latin America, were up 34% versus last year to $1.3 billion.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.2 billion, up 34% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses Ã¢ÂÂ specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, as well as hardware-related costs reflecting the continued strong performance of our new Made by Google product line.
YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising.
Results benefited from a slower rate of decline in the traditional Network business than in prior periods, although it continues to be negatively affected by both the ongoing shift by advertisers to programmatic and our ongoing policy efforts.
Specifically, Play benefited from both broad-based app strength but also from all the work we have done in areas such as direct carrier billing, which helps more people globally access and buy their favorite apps and games on Google Play.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.6 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 22% year over year.
Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year over year as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate, driven by the shift to mobile, which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, which carries lower TAC.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.
As we discussed in prior calls, even though mobile revenue growth requires an increasing investment in the mobile ecosystem in the form of higher TAC, our strength in mobile search is adding meaningfully to profit dollars.
We'll host our annual developer conference, Google I/O; our advertising event, Google Marketing Next; and our YouTube upfront, Brandcast.
First, how our continued investments in machine learning are fueling innovation across Google, and particularly how it's helping drive our core mission of providing access to information for everyone.
YouTube continues to be the most popular destination for online video globally, and we are focused on building awesome experiences.
This quarter we announced YouTube TV, which offers live TV from major broadcast and cable networks, a cloud-based DVR without storage limits, and streaming on all of your devices.
That's across AdSense, YouTube, and Google Play, and it doesn't even include device sales by many hardware partners who build on Android.
And thanks to partnerships with major brands like TAG and Fossil, there'll be more than 20 different Android Wear watches available this year, doubling the number from last year.
Our virtual reality platform Daydream, which debuted almost a year ago, continues to gain traction with more devices and more great content, like VR video.
We have increased our investment in machine learning in our advertising business, with efforts like Smart Bidding, where our systems predict the performance of an ad and adjust advertisers' bids in real time to maximize their results.
Brands like Williams-Sonoma have seen a 70% increase in mobile sales year over year, with Google mobile shopping ads playing a big part.
Thanks to our app install advertising products, developers have already driven more than 5 billion app downloads.
It incorporates machine learning to improve campaigns and drive great results for advertisers.
We recently announced new innovations at the Game Developers Conference, including an interactive playable ad format in Universal App Campaigns that lets users play a lightweight version of your game right in the ad.
Brands love the reach and engagement that they get across YouTube, along with the effectiveness of formats like TrueView skippable ads and our new bumper ads, which are snackable six-second videos that drive incremental reach and frequency.
And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities.
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
And just how does the management team think about balancing profitability versus driving market share and long-term growth?
So, for example, when we recently invested in original shows, we find that like over half the time people spend watching originals is on their mobile phones.
YouTube, Google Earth VR, Tilt Brush Ã¢ÂÂ these are all great examples.
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Growth in advertising revenues was again driven by mobile search, with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $9.8 billion, up 28% year on year.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count growth was in Cloud, consistent with the priority we place on this business.
The biggest contributor to growth again this quarter was mobile search, reflecting the secular shift to mobile due to the greater utility of smartphones for users and advertisers, but obviously also benefiting from our focus on continuously enhancing features and functionality.
Last quarter we talked about our bigger investment areas, and you can see the strong momentum here, reflecting contributions from each of Play, hardware, and Cloud.
Google Cloud continues to drive sizable growth, with Google Cloud Platform remaining one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet.
First, we've benefited from our team's innovations that continually enhance our advertising business, as evidenced by the ongoing growth of Sites revenues.
Second, the strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams, including those from Cloud, hardware, and YouTube subscription offerings.
We also continue to announce new integration partners for the Google Assistant, so you can now ask it to do things like dim the living room lights.
Our Google Cloud Next conference in March was a great opportunity to highlight core areas of differentiation for GCP, like new security products and the recognition that we had the highest cloud availability in 2016, according to CloudHarmony.
Sales continues to be strong, and we are actively working to bring these great devices to more people around the world.
Our platforms have had great success over the years, creating incredible user experiences, as well as real opportunities and economic success for partners, creators, and developers around the globe.
Our great properties, like Search, Maps, YouTube, and Google Play, are the prime time for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions.
Next was Ã¢ÂÂ having done Google I/O many, many times, I was surprised to see the scale and growth of Next from even last year to this year.
So we find that when we drive the Assistant experience well, it works overall in helping people engage with Google at a broader level.
So those are beginning to get good feedback from users, and I think that gives us an opportunity to add value there over time as well.
I think there's a lot more work there, but the rate at which we are seeing advertisers Ã¢ÂÂ small, medium businesses Ã¢ÂÂ on our platform has been growing very, very strongly as well.
And then you talked about the real-time local-inventory integration, but, Sundar, I'd be curious if you could talk about any opportunities or areas of innovation in the retail search space that you see to really continue to improve users' retail-search experience.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc. I think obviously when we see what users are looking for in mobile, how shopping is evolving, it's an area we're continuously working on.
And so as we start doing that, and I think as we get a better understanding of their inventory and the data, how we can translate all of that into our core experience is a bit of the work ahead.
Shorter term, I think it's a space we continue to invest in.
And so I think to me that shows the long-term investments you make in these relationships, et cetera, plays well at times like these.
Sundar, ahead of this advertising conference I was thinking about Search innovation.
And that's the way we look at it, is we have tremendous opportunity continuing in mobile search and in YouTube across the business there.
And we're excited about the growth opportunities, not just within Google but across Alphabet with all that we're doing in Other Bets.
And then secondly, I wonder, with that focus on brand safety you hear now from agencies and the bigger marketers, what's going to be the long-term impact, do you think, to YouTube programmatic from a more focused view on finding the right places to advertise?
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. So on Sites TAC, as we've often discussed, and as you said in your question, there are a number of factors that affect Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue, and the primary driver has been the strong growth in mobile and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to TAC.
And on YouTube, when I look at it from a content creator standpoint, I think there are a lot of factors which are working well.
And so I think if you go and create these experiences in a way that works at scale for users, the monetization will follow.

google,q2,2017,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Our revenues of $26 billion in the second quarter demonstrate the ongoing momentum in our businesses with broad-based strength globally.
Let me wrap up, almost two years after the creation of Alphabet, we see the benefits of our focus within Google and Other Bets and are pleased with the opportunities we have for sustained revenue and earnings growth.
Our revenue growth and Alphabet structure give us both the opportunity and confidence to invest in our businesses for the long-term.
It's a good question, when I think about, we have, we are very focused over the long-term to making sure the Assistant can actually help people get things done in the real world.
And so over time we are laser focused on making sure we can deliver against those experiences, and I think local and their particular strength over time both in terms of, the expertise we have built in local as well as our investment in Maps is hopefully paying off.
And then on the OpEx side, the second quarter reflects a number of factors, first I think really to your question on an overtime point, you can see the impact of the timing shift in the equity refresh which we discussed previously.
But as I said in my opening comments, we're increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential, we are scaling it back in others, we're focused on organizational effectiveness to make the most of all of our resources and all of that really underpins the goal to sustain both revenue and earnings growth over the longer term.
Overall, when we think about our infrastructure obviously we are serving Cloud as well as our internal products which are seeing tremendous growth as well.
In terms of go-to-market, I shared an update on last, on that last quarter not sure there is much more interesting to add, we are continuing to do it well, we are scaling up and all the teams and the structure Diana has put in place is beginning to work well.
And then Sundar, another one more interesting innovations, that was, that kind of came out of Google IO was Visual Search, and can you just talk about, maybe a little bit roadmap for that or to the extent that which, how long it will take us actually see that broadly in the market, and what you think the appetite or how do you think that will change the way people search for products in the future they build need to also search visually through your phone?
But the increase in Sites TAC year-over-year, I think what I would stress is it really provides another lens on just how strong our mobile business is.
But I think at the, main point of your question here is we do continue to expect Sites TAC to increase, but our focus remains on growing profit dollars and I go back to my comment which is really pleased with the strength of our mobile business, which is benefiting profit dollars even as the TAC percentage increases.
First, I'm wondering if you could comment at all on the cloud business profitability, medium or long-term, how you are thinking about that.
We are clearly excited about the opportunity we have here and it does continue to drive sizable revenue growth as I said in my opening comments as did Sundar and we are seeing momentum in the business.
I think the comment that Sundar made about the number of new deals over 500,000 increasing 3x year-on-year gives you an indication of the momentum in the business.
It's obviously not a financial forecast but it does display the traction we are having with cloud in the market and GCP remains one of the fastest growing businesses across Alphabet, G-suite continues to have strong growth.
We do believe that from -- the many years of investment we have already made and things like technical infrastructure and security which operate with tremendous efficiency that provides us with a benefit, but near term we are investing meaningfully in sales and engineering service support -- continuing to expand out regions to make sure that we are delivering the best experience for our enterprise customers and that's what we are really focused on.
And then, Ruth, in your prepared remarks you mentioned tremendous growth in mobile search in the quarter, I think that's a more emphatic statement in recent quarters, hoping that maybe you could provide more color on some of the areas where you are seeing the change and quite trajectory coming from within mobile search?
And then on mobile search, I think what you are hearing is, we are really pleased with the ongoing efforts there and as I just said there was not one change that really drove this, what extraordinary about the team is, with the focus on users and advertisers, what is it that is most useful Sundar has spoke about some of them with local, but it's really again -- it's a lot of small incremental efforts that in the aggregate continue to enable us to benefit from whatÃ¢ÂÂs a really nice underlying secular trend here.
So, yes, there is broad based strength across geographies and I think -- I'm not calling out one particular area because the -- what you are seeing here is the secular trend I have used that term a couple of times now.
It's obviously a mix of businesses including some of our bigger investment areas, most notably cloud and hardware and as I said at the outset Play continues to perform really well.
And in terms of products like Google Assistant and Voice, I think we will make sure for users it doesn't matter and they work across every platform they use including our platforms as well as other people's platform.
And maybe on YouTube I would say, YouTube is one of those products which is scaling really well globally just like search did and we are seeing real strong growth on mobile.
So, if I look at YouTube on mobile on emerging markets on larger screens, they all look like newer opportunities and so I think there is a lot more growth ahead.
Advertising revenues benefitted from the strong performance insights, which was led in particular by tremendous results in mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube.
Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter after which we will take questions.
Other America's revenues which include results from Canada and Latin America were $1.4 billion up 31% versus last year in both reported and fixed FX terms.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.3 billion up 27% year-over-year primarily driven by Google related expenses.
Hardware continues to grow at a healthy pace year-on-year with the extension of our product line geographically, particularly Google Home and Wi-Fi, the dollar impacted growth was more muted than in prior quarters reflecting seasonality.
We continue to see increasing contributions from our growing non-ads revenue businesses, Play continues to be a strong contributor, in addition we have been making big Bets within Google focused on Cloud, hardware and subscription businesses in YouTube in order to better serve customers, while also building additional and differentiated revenue streams.
Our ability to rapidly deploy the best machine learning in all of our products enabled us this quarter to launch all sorts of new smart features, to help moderate comments, suggest smart replies in Gmail and improved translations.
We rolled out new machine learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos, which now has more than 500 million monthly users who backup 1.2 billion photos and videos every day.
Google Cloud Platform, GCP continues to experience impressive growth across products, sectors and geographies and increasingly with large enterprise customers in regulated sectors.
An incredible 82 billion apps were downloaded from Google Play in the last year alone.
Here to machine learning is critical to helping advertisers and app developers analyze data in real time to reach consumers with more useful ads and measure campaign effectiveness.
We also launched new ad formats and bidding features in Universal App Campaigns to help developers grow their user base across Google Play, Search, YouTube, Gmail and the Display Network.
At Google IO in 2016, we announced we had driven 2 billion app installs, today that number is more than 5 billion that's amazing growth.
Every month Google helps drive 100 billion visits to business websites and creates more than 3 billion direct connections between businesses and their customers.
I'm looking forward to seeing first time how technology and Google's products can make a real difference in people's lives.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS Securities.
Great, thanks for taking my question.
First one for Ruth, I was just hoping you could help us understand at least qualitatively how core margins for the advertising business are trending within the Google segment?
So starting with your margin question like as we've often said, we're focused on revenue and operating income dollar growth and not on operating margins.
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities.
One for Sundar, at Marketing Next your team unveiled new ways that Google is leveraging consumer intense signals across your billion user plus platforms.
Thanks for taking my questions today.
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch.
But, since [indiscernible] measurement was announced three years ago advertisers have mentioned over 5 billion store visits globally.

google,q3,2017,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Alphabet Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call.
Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
APAC revenues were $4.2 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 31% in fixed FX terms.
The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.
A couple of updates; Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with a number of notable launches including the Nest Thermostat E, which is offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat.
In that regard, the most important point is that we are data driven with an extraordinary team of engineers, product managers and designers, who constantly challenge assumptions and run thousands of experiments annually to enhance user and advertiser experiences.
This approach enables us to find new opportunities given that the way consumers seek information continues to evolve.
Pressure in our total cost of revenues reflects our product mix shift with a number of our higher growth businesses also carrying higher cost of revenues.
The other cost of revenues associated with our non-advertising businesses is also affected by product mix.
The more modest OpEx growth in Q3 reflects both the timing of stock-based compensation and the timing of sales and marketing spend, with the reality that not all investments fall neatly into a single calendar quarter.
It's been particularly exciting to see our early bet on artificial intelligence pay off and go from a research project to something that can solve new problems for a billion people a day.
We introduced Assistant last year and it continues to get better every day, helping people get things done in the real world.
That billion plus people using Google Maps now get thoughtfully contextual information like how to find parking where they are going.
I'm really pleased with the way our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome, have continued to grow, enabling great experiences for people all over the world and powering devices for more than 1,000 brands worldwide.
And we are working with publishers to build a frictionless payment solutions for subscriptions that can help them grow revenues and find new readers.
To wrap up my overview, I'm thrilled with how Google is solving big problems and making products that billions of people use every day.
This quarter, we launched a new feature that lets viewers share videos directly in the app.
Customers tell us they are switching to Google Cloud Platform because of our prowess in data analytics and machine learning, our commitment to being an open platform with tools like Kubernetes, which runs in both cloud and hybrid environments and our leadership in security.
Also this quarter, we signed a deal with HTC in Taiwan that will help accelerate our hardware business by bringing on a team of talented engineers.
And Google continues to be the platform of choice to help small business owners get online and grow their business.
During the quarter, more than 1 million small businesses used it to build up websites, helping many of them get online for the first time.
We also introduced local post, which allows small business owners to easily post their latest updates like upcoming events, special offers and new arrivals, right on Google Search in Maps.
Our commitment to both large and small advertisers shows how we build products that all businesses can succeed in.
Just two weeks ago, I was in Pittsburgh launching our new Grow with Google initiative, which provides digital skills to millions of people and economic opportunity to countless businesses.
But with shopping, especially as we move on to making shopping more seamless across mobile and newer computing categories like Google Home, I think there's tremendous interest here.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Is there something different that Alphabet/Google has done in Asia to accelerate that growth?
And also launched region-specific products like Google Tez in India.
Hey, I like to Ã¢ÂÂ maybe discuss a couple of your growth businesses.
You've made large and exciting investment in growth opportunities across Google and Other Bets.
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $19.7 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Earlier this month, for example, we launched our expanded line of hardware products, bringing the best AI software and hardware together and building on the first generation of Made by Google products we introduced last year.
Second, with respect to profitability, we continue to remain focused on long-term dollar growth versus margins.
In our advertising businesses, TAC continues to increase as our highest growth areas, mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
In the fourth quarter in particular, the impact of our growing hardware line will be more accentuated given the early stage of this business and holiday seasonality.
Third, as to CapEx, we continue to invest to support business momentum, including increased compute power from machine learning, which is an asset across Alphabet as well as to support cloud, search and YouTube growth.
I've been really proud of the progress this quarter, launching popular new products and continuing to grow our business in new areas.
Three of the key areas we are focused on are; strengthening the existing community, continuing to drive growth and expanding our subscriptions business.
To support our growing global customer base, we introduced two new regions in the quarter in SÃÂ£o Paulo and Frankfurt and continue to grow our go-to-market team.
This year, we are focused on bringing together the best AI software and hardware to give people a great user experience.
We have a host of really exciting opportunities and ensuring that we're investing to support long-term growth remains number one.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc. The Asia question, largely, I think we've been laying a foundation for a very, very long time.
I think the most important point is that what you're seeing is we have a very healthy mobile business, search business and it is growing substantially and our focus remains on long-term revenue and profit dollar growth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. So it felt like a number of calls talked about the fact that there was no one item that was driving the momentum we saw in our sites revenue, and that was the point of giving you a bit more color here.
We are really pleased with the momentum in the business, excited about the opportunities we have given the ongoing strong underlying secular trend, but wanted to give you more color on what do we mean by a culture of innovation, and that's really why I tried to get into a bit more about the rigor of the process.
And I guess, in particular, how do you think about maintaining Google fleet as the way we search changes, and as we see increasing adoption of these voice-enabled digital assistance in the home?
So as the mobile search market matures, particularly in the Western markets, the question is, why does Google feel like it needs to pay any TAC to partners at all?
So we are driving it forward in a way in which we know it's going to give strong both revenue and earnings growth.
Sundar, how do you think about the strategic importance to drive Chrome and Google Assistant app installs and user growth on non-Android mobile platforms?
A lot of the things that we're doing are multi-year investments, and that's why we stress repeatedly that we're looking at what are the long-term needs and opportunities that we could be addressing, if we're doing that well, we're delivering long-term revenue and earnings growth.
Yeah, main thing I would say is the consumer feedback, I think there's always been this promise on being able to, just like today on Google Search when you want something, we make it so easy for you to find it.
And we are gathering a lot of feedback, bringing it to more markets, and I'm going to work hard at making the product better.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. So in terms of TAC, as I indicated, we've got a couple of things going on.
On the second thing, look, I think based on every metric we see users' information needs are only going up.
So Sundar, can you talk about how Google is positioning in the emerging markets over the longer term can be different versus what we are used to seeing here in the States.
So I think we see a way to look at these markets with a lot more thought and address them for the opportunity that they have, not just apply our global products there.
",54.56,0.8411128
google,q4,2017,"The ongoing very strong performance in sites revenue in particular reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth with mobile search again leading the way.
APAC revenues were $4.7 billion, up 30% versus last year and up 32% in fixed FX terms, reflecting weakening of the Japanese yen.
Other Americas revenues were $1.9 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 30% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strengthening of the Canadian dollar.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically, costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, hardware-related costs for our expanded Made by Google family of products and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.
IÃ¢ÂÂll cover results for the full-year 2017 because it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon, as discussed on prior calls.
With the closing of our deal with HTC earlier this week for example, weÃ¢ÂÂve added 2,000 employees to support our hardware business.
The most sizable catalyst for added investment in compute power include the expanding application of machine learning efforts across Alphabet as well as additional requirements for GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs Cloud, Search and YouTube businesses.
A lot has changed but our mission organizing the worldÃ¢ÂÂs information and making it universally accessible and useful remains the best guide for the next 10 years.
Google Cloud, which includes Google Cloud Platform and G Suite, has reached meaningful scale, and IÃ¢ÂÂm excited to share today that itÃ¢ÂÂs already $1 billion per quarter business.
Every month more than 1.5 billion people come to YouTube to watch their favorite content on channels ranging from the Ellen Show which has more than 22 million subscribers to the NBA with over 8 million subscribers to SciShow, a really popular educational channel with more than 4.5 million subscribers.
There was a lot of excitement around the Google Assistant at CES from partners and consumers where we brought the Assistant to new surfaces like smart displays from brands like JBL and Lenovo as well as Android Auto which is now available in more than 400 car models from brands like GM, Hyundai and Volvo.
As shoppers turned to their mobile phones this holiday shopping season, Google was central to helping them discover new brands, compare products and find the best deals.
We are focused on making sure YouTube is a great place for users and advertisers while helping creators earn money from popular content.
This includes news publishers, app developers and YouTube creators, who we share revenue with.
Over the last four years, our partners have earned over $100 billion; thatÃ¢ÂÂs incredible and we are working on new ways to drive even more value to our partners.
We will also be building or opening five big new data centers in the U.S. And with digital skills and high demand by employers, our Grow with Google initiative will have job seekers and small businesses gain education and skills to help them succeed.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.
Some big news earlier this week just in terms of Waymo with FCA talking about delivering thousands of minivans to Waymo later in the year.
Third is CapEx. And when we considered all of that thatÃ¢ÂÂs led us to extend -- have the Board extend share repurchase program which we announced a couple of years ago.
And we work hard to make sure we bring the best experience possible, which is why I said [ph] they were also Search and Assistant we partner with companies like Walmart for example to make it much easier to buy products and so on.
Any other information you can give us there on user growth or engagement trends would be great, anything on time spent, I mean particularly as YouTube becomes more mature and mobile video particularly in North America gets more competitive.
Maybe one area which for example highlights how well itÃ¢ÂÂs doing is if you think about YouTube on TV, people actually want watching YouTube on the big screen, our growth has been significant there.
We obviously want to make sure YouTube has a great experience for users, content creators and advertisers because it supports content creators.
As we move from just answers to helping users complete actions about time including transactions, the ability to complete the transaction is an important part of it and which is why making sure Google Pay in a unified way works as seamlessly as possible is a big part of our long-term strategy.
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Our momentum reflects the relentless focus on users, advertisers and enterprise customers as well as the benefits of our commitment to long-term investing.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22.2 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Both mobile and desktop search continue to grow and benefit from our approach to innovation with strong momentum as we identify additional opportunities to enhance the user and advertiser experience.
As weÃ¢ÂÂve consistently emphasized, alongside the continued momentum in our advertising business, we are focused on building a second wave of growth within Google over the medium and long-term which includes the rapidly growing revenue businesses in Google, cloud, hardware and YouTube.
With respect to cloud, weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing the benefits of a fully featured enterprise offering and an expanded go-to-market team, bringing our advantages in infrastructure, data analytics, security and machine learning to more customers.
Finally, as we look further into the future for our third wave of growth, we remain excited about the longer term potential for our Other Bets businesses.
While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue will slow after the first quarter of 2018.
As I discussed on last quarterÃ¢ÂÂs call, marketing spend in the fourth quarter is significantly elevated, in particular supporting hardware but also across cloud and YouTube.
For 2018, we remain excited about the investments we are making to drive the next phase of growth in our big bets in Google in cloud, hardware and YouTube, and our machine learning efforts which are powering innovation across our businesses.
We are excited about the significant opportunities weÃ¢ÂÂve identified in our businesses and continue to invest appropriately.
There is great momentum around the Google Assistant as we bring it to more people on more devices.
In addition to the significant work we are doing to product users and stop abuse on the platform, just a few weeks ago, we announced changes to advertising on YouTube, including stricter monetization criteria, new manual reviews for all videos in Google Preferred and simpler controls for marketers.
Sundar, coming out of CES and the success you had with Google Home and the Google Assistant during the holiday period based on the blog post you guys put out, can you identify some of the key investments in either partnerships or hardware or capabilities that youÃ¢ÂÂre targeting over the next one to two years to make sure the momentum around Assistant is sustained?
So, I think the framework is great, and long-term, our investments in AI will directly manifest its capabilities for users through the Google Assistant.
And as you know well, the TAC rate for each of sites network as a percentage of revenue lines, thatÃ¢ÂÂs continued to increase because theyÃ¢ÂÂre our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic and so carry higher TAC.
And then, the other thing to note, other cost of revenue does reflect the seasonality of hardware, having increased both the number of products and the Made by Google family as well as continuing to expand geographically in western Europe and APAC, you can see that reflected here.
And how do we think about these impacting the rate of change in TAC, since you are talking about the pace of growth in TAC as we look out, call it in year two if these are multiyear deals?
I mean, given the ongoing momentum in our mobile search business, this does continue to be relevant, as you look forward, given mobile carryÃ¢ÂÂs higher TAC.
So, we continue to invest in machines to support growth we see across Google but in particular supporting Cloud, Search, YouTube and all that we are doing in machine learning.
The first one, Ruth, you called out desktop search, I think the second straight quarter as being relatively strong.
And then, Ruth, just a question on the growth in marketing spend in the fourth quarter.
Our growth last year was very strong there, which is why we supported it with investments like YouTube Go. And we are seeing it now grow well-beyond mobile, especially in the leaving room.
And as both, Sundar and IÃ¢ÂÂve said, these are important Google growth areas for us and we are investing to support growth in the business.
And then, Ruth, in the prepared remarks, there was a lot of comments on investment in your medium-term business growth drivers, offices, data centers and other areas.
And that we just continue to be focused on doing the right things to support growth of the business.
On the video gaming side, I think, look, we are -- maybe today have a lot of momentum in these areas, both with YouTube as a platform, Google play.
",48.98,0.7751083
google,q1,2018,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
The sustained outstanding performance in sites revenues, in particular, reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth, with mobile search again leading the way.
Ongoing substantial growth in other revenues, namely cloud, hardware and Play, continues to highlight the growing contribution of our non-ads opportunities.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.5 billion, up 37% year-on-year.
The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects advertising investments in cloud and hardware as well as the Assistant.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year, led again by mobile search complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
As we previously announced, we made a change this quarter to impression-based monetization metrics for our network business given the ongoing growth of programmatic.
This year-on-year increase in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC.
The opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary, and we remain focused on investment to support long-term revenue and profit growth.
We're pleased with the continued momentum of our revenue growth again this quarter, reflecting strong underlying trends across our business, which are amplified by our relentless focus on innovation, not only in our newer businesses, like cloud and hardware, but in our sites business.
At 26% year-on-year revenue growth in our sites business, we continue to benefit from our investments to enhance the user and advertiser experience.
While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenues, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we continue to anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues, will slow beginning in this second quarter.
We appreciate the importance of prioritization and are keenly focused on the steps we can take to make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns.
These combined investments will expand our compute capacity to support our growth outlook across Google, including machine learning, the Assistant and cloud.
Today, I'll quickly talk about how machine learning is helping us advance that mission, then I'll highlight progress in our 3 big areas, cloud, YouTube and hardware, and share updates on our computing and advertising platforms.
So we keep coming back to when you create vehicles that drive themselves faithfully, we think there's a lot of potential uses and business opportunities, and that's what we're focused on.
But overall, we think we'll be able to do all that with the positive impact for users and publishers and the advertisers and so our business.
But I think more to your question with respect to technical infrastructure, that reflects investments in compute power to support growth that we see across Google, and the largest component is on machines.
So I think, really, to answer your question most directly, it reflects the demand that we're seeing, so I wouldn't want to suggest a one-off in terms of the investments we're making in technical infrastructure.
On the first question of cloud, look, I mean, I think the main thing I would say is the fundamental drivers of adoption of Google Cloud based on what we hear back from customers is our advantage in data analytics and machine learning.
And so these changes had a positive impact on the year-on-year growth in CPMs. And then the trend and impressions in CPMs can clearly be volatile from quarter-to-quarter as we're optimizing for the user publisher and advertiser, but it really goes to the efforts that we make.
As we've talked about on many, many calls, we have been and remain focused on supporting long-term revenue and profit growth, and we think the opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary.
And so we're continuing to invest to enhance the user and advertiser experience, and thereby, extend the growth in our ads business.
As I noted in our opening comments, the investments we're making there really provide the compute capacity to support our growth outlook, and that's supporting the opportunities that come out of machine learning and the Assistant.
And so we're investing to support the long-term growth opportunity there.
As we highlighted in our earnings press release, our results this quarter were affected by a new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments.
The key drivers were, first, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which was affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses primarily from G&A; second, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and finally, hardware related costs.
Operating expenses were $10.7 billion, up 27% year-over-year, with the biggest increase in R&D expenses reflecting our continued investment in technical talent.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were the additions from HTC followed by hiring and cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Other income and expense was $3.5 billion, which includes $3 billion of primarily unrealized gains in equity security investments recognized under the new accounting standard.
As indicated in the table in our earnings press release, these results reflect an increase in net income of $2.4 billion and $3.40 in earnings per diluted share due to the impact from the gains in equity security investments we've already discussed.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $7.7 billion, reflecting investments in facilities, production equipment and data center construction.
Our commitment to growth is evident in the trend in CapEx investment, almost equally split this quarter between compute capacity and facilities.
In many respects, these investments underscore my opening comment about both our confidence and clarity about future opportunities with our focus on proprietary solutions that enable us to deliver the secure, reliable, high-performing compute infrastructure to support new and emerging products and services for our users, advertisers and enterprise customers.
Over the years, we have worked closely with the news industry to address key challenges through projects like Accelerated Mobile Pages.
As part of this effort, we announced more than a dozen new products, including Subscribe with Google developed in close collaboration with publishers, which lets you use your Google account to buy a subscription on participating news sites.
All told, the Google Assistant can now help you with over 1 million actions, including new things like reminding you to buy bread when you get to the store or sending money to friends or if you want to get a ride share home.
This app reduces the amount of data needed to display search results by 40%, and we continue to invest in ways to give people granular and easy controls over their information across all our products.
Some examples of new technologies announced in the quarter include Cloud AutoML, which makes it easier for companies without machine learning expertise to build complex neural nets and more than 20 new security products.
This quarter, Dua Lipa's video for New Rules became the 100th video on YouTube to reach 1 billion views.
Even as we invest in new experiences, we stay very focused on making sure that YouTube remains a safe platform with great content.
This uses machine learning to analyze ad placements on a publisher's page and show ads when they are likely to perform well while providing a good user experience.
If you could talk a little bit about just the latest timing for the commercial launch in Phoenix and how quickly you'd look to expand to other markets, and then just how you're thinking about the technology and whether you'll license it to others going forward or keep it more proprietary for Waymo services?
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley.
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird.
Mobile web is still a big part of how users consume content, especially around news, and so us investing there clearly makes a difference.
And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of CrÃÂ©dit Suisse.
So Sundar, I think one of the themes that you as a management team has talked about has been to, I guess, democratize advertising with AI to help SMBs who may have found advertising across Google's ad products to be perhaps overwhelming.
",42.65,0.8029101
google,q2,2018,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
We delivered another quarter with strong operating performance, reflecting our focus on building great experiences for users, advertisers and enterprise customers around the world.
Sites revenues continued to exhibit strong year-on-year momentum, benefiting from innovation and secular growth with mobile search again leading the way.
Our outline for todayÃ¢ÂÂs call is IÃ¢ÂÂll begin with results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes.
Second, as discussed last quarter, our results are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses.
G&A expense trends in the second quarter were affected by a number of factors, in particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily the other cost of revenues.
Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 21% year-over-year.
As discussed previously, we continue to identify new opportunities through innovation, including the benefits of applying machine learning to create more useful experiences for users and advertisers.
For our Other Bets, we remain focused on making progress on a number of commercial opportunities across the business, while continuing to manage investment against achievement of key milestones.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre also investing in new businesses that are growing at a rapid pace and have sizable compute needs, most notably Cloud.
And keeping with our approach across Alphabet to invest thoughtfully for long-term value creation, we remain focused on both performance and cost effectiveness.
10 years ago, we launched the first Android phone with a simple idea to build a mobile platform thatÃ¢ÂÂs free and open to everyone.
Continuing this momentum, at I/O, we unveiled a plethora of new features throughout the Android platform, like battery saving features in Android P, new Google Assistant capabilities on Wear OS, the new Android model to help developers optimize for a variety of devices and form factors, as well as tools to help users understand and control how they are spending time on their device.
While advertising on YouTube is an incredibly strong and growing source of income for creators, we are also investing in new ways for creators to generate revenue on the platform, including paid channel memberships, merchandise shelves on YouTube channels, and endorsement opportunities, through a company we acquired in 2016, FameBit. At Google Marketing Live, we introduced our newly rebranded advertising products, our core product Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform which provides analytics and ad serving for large marketers and agencies, and Google Ad Manager, our monetization engine for publishers.
We also announced a new ad format powered by machine learning, called Responsive Search Ads. It automates the manual process of building text ads and optimizes them in real time to show the best performing ad for each search query.
This quarter, we announced shopping and commerce partnerships with leading global retailers like Carrefour, designed to give people the power to shop wherever and however they want.
Financial institutions are increasingly turning to the cloud to modernize their systems, explore new business models and improve customer experiences.
Before I close, I want to give a quick shout out to the work that we are doing to build great specialized products for the next wave of people coming online for the first time in countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria, many of whom experience the web only through their mobile phone.
And to help spur AI innovation in Africa, we recently announced the new Google AI research center in Ghana with the goal of bringing together top machine learning researchers and engineers to explore AI research and applications in Africa and beyond.
I want to thank Googlers for their hard work which helps us create products that billions of people love and use every day.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.
What Google brings on table for those partners, what it might do for the advertising services business as we thing long-term?
Is there any you can give us of some of the key investment milestones or how we should be thinking about capital allocated to the Waymo business in the coming years?
We talked this past quarter about licensing the technology for personal use vehicles, and weÃ¢ÂÂre also focused on working with cities to help strengthen public transportation.
As I said, weÃ¢ÂÂre excited about the long-term opportunity but creation of a new market does take time.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve talked about that on many prior calls and are investing here for long-term value creation thoughtfully in order to be able to pursue the opportunities that we see ahead of us.
And local campaigns is something new which we announced at Google Marketing Live a couple of weeks ago.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs a valuable driver of our growth, not only enhancing experiences for users but the tools that we talked about for advertisers and for app developers, certainly helping them find the right audience, to be able to optimize campaigns at scale, to deliver more relevant and higher quality ads.
The Google Marketing Live, weÃ¢ÂÂve really highlighted what weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing there and the benefits, whether weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about responsive search ads or local campaigns, smart shopping campaigns, another great example is universal app campaigns.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which IÃ¢ÂÂll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.9 billion, up 34% year-on-year.
Looking ahead, our hardware business is seasonal, typically experiencing lower growth in the third quarter in anticipation of the launch of new products for the holiday season.
As weÃ¢ÂÂve discussed for the past couple of quarters, we expected the pace of year-on-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue would slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that clearly in our results of this quarter.
As frequently discussed, we do expect the sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, albeit at a more moderate pace relative to the year-on-year increases experienced over the past several quarters.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been investing meaningfully in search and ads consistent with the opportunities we see to benefit the user and advertiser experience.
The investment pace also reflects the importance of machine learning across all of our products including search and ads.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs been a busy few months at Google, and we showed a lot of what we are working on at events like Google Marketing Live, Brandcast, and of course our annual developer conference, Google I/O.
The common thread youÃ¢ÂÂll hear on todayÃ¢ÂÂs call is the benefit of machine learning and AI, and how itÃ¢ÂÂs improving our products and generating great results for our users and partners.
And with over 1 billion users, weÃ¢ÂÂre continuing to see tremendous growth in maps with especially strong growth in countries like Indonesia, India and Nigeria, each of which are growing over 50% year-on-year.
Our investments in our computing platforms, as well as in AI and design are also helping us generate great momentum in our made by Google hardware business across Pixel, Home, Nest, Chromecast and more.
So, weÃ¢ÂÂre taking the end-to-end user experience in mind, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs where all the investments we have done over many, many years I think will come into play as the product evolves.
So, in terms of your first question and kind of machine learning, and I think youÃ¢ÂÂre kind of getting at cycle.
YouÃ¢ÂÂre really seeing it in two places, and part of that is they called out is with respect to OpEx. WeÃ¢ÂÂre hiring and what youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing is the investments weÃ¢ÂÂre making across the board, itÃ¢ÂÂs ads, itÃ¢ÂÂs cloud, itÃ¢ÂÂs hardware, itÃ¢ÂÂs the Assistant, but this is also very much in machine learning and we are really proud of the team that we have and given the opportunity set that they are able to address.
And I think you were getting more broadly at CapEx. The way weÃ¢ÂÂre focused on CapEx, as I said last quarter as well, we view this as it lands into our outlook for growth and the required additional compute capacity.
And part is really to support growth that we are seeing in our search and ads business thatÃ¢ÂÂs really consistent with the momentum that weÃ¢ÂÂve commented on today and the exciting opportunities that we see to further enhance the user and advertiser experience.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve talked about this in the past, machine learning is more compute intensive, but it also opens up more services and products across Alphabet, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what we are investing in to make sure that weÃ¢ÂÂve got the capacity with best-in-class compute capacity.
And then, for Ruth, on the theme of OpEx investment trends, if we isolate just the other revenue businesses, Cloud, Play and Hardware, all growth drivers, but clearly structurally different in terms of the competitive landscape and profitability.
And in terms of your question, on investment priorities, I think one of the most important points to underscore is that one of the biggest opportunities for investment, continues to be in our ads business where we are continuing to investment meaningfully, given the opportunity set that we see there.
Sundar commented on some of them, as did I, looking at opportunities to enhance the user experience, to continue to improve tools for advertisers, and both of which extend the growth there.
When we start with cloud, as Sundar commented, given the core capabilities that we are building upon, our technical infrastructure, security app, machine learning, analytical tools, our view is that weÃ¢ÂÂre addressing a rapidly growing market with the core pillars that are needed to win.
Our hardware business continues to deliver significant growth, particularly with the sales as a home family of products, and youÃ¢ÂÂve seen us invest there.
And we are continuing to invest in building a local experience that benefits merchants, users and advertisers.
Colin, on Google Assistant and Shopping Actions, there I do think itÃ¢ÂÂs been exciting to see the improvement there, but I still would like that experience theyÃ¢ÂÂve all a lot more before we play around with monetization.
So, in terms of sites revenue, I think, our view is ongoing strength reflects our focus on improving the user experience and enhancing tools for advertisers.
And IÃ¢ÂÂd add that a good way to think about it is, today, there is a lot of complexity you need to deal with to have advertiser, and increasingly we are using machine learning to do all the hard work and get them to focus on the business problem they are trying to solve.
On YouTube, we definitely are continuing to see great product momentum, itÃ¢ÂÂs the user adoption and interest and our metrics are very strong, continues to grow and the growth is global.

google,q3,2018,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Starting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter, our total revenues of $33.7 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $385 million or $305 million after the impact of our hedging program.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses.
The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation which continue to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.
As discussed in the previous two quarters, both operating income and OI&E are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities.
We get billions of questions from users every day and about 15% of those are queries we have never seen before.
It's a great example of how we bring together Google's strengths to help people through their day.
They include a new AI powered ranking approach that delivers more relevant results, a redesigned Google feed called Discover to help you stay informed on topics that matter to you and a new search experience for Google images.
We launched our first set of smart displays with Lenovo and JBL as well as our own Google Home Hub. Pixel users in the U.S. will be the first to try our new duplex technology which helps you complete real-world tasks over the phone like calling a restaurant to book a table and we introduced a new way to easily book ride services with your Google Assistant.
For example, our recent flood prediction efforts, which use AI to better predict when floods will occur had the potential to help millions of people get out of harm's way.
Every day people from all over the world turn to YouTube to learn something new from career skills to coding to cooking.
Just this week, we announced a $20 million investment to expand our YouTube Learning initiative which will help fund established and emerging educational careers.
YouTube's Ask business continues to provide great results for marketers and creators.
Advertisers love that we are bringing our machine learning strengths to offerings like responsive search ads and universal App Campaigns to create more effective ads.
In apps, we announced a partnership with Unity Technologies, which gives our advertisers access to one of the largest global networks of mobile gaming titles across 1.5 billion devices.
One of our big wins in the quarter was Fast Retailing, the Japanese retailer best known for its popular brand UNIQLO, which is migrating its employees globally to G Suite, while also pursuing AI solutions like on-demand forecasting on Google Cloud Platform.
Our cloud business is benefiting from our investments in technical infrastructure including a U.S.-Europe cable that will improve speeds for millions of people.
We're also building products to meet the specific needs of users in the region like Tez, a digital payments app for India, to help people easily pay their electrician or split it in a bill with just a few taps.
Just one year since it launched, over 30 million people in businesses across India now use the app every month and they've collectively made more than 1 billion transactions.
In Q3, more than 80% of Alphabet's total capital expenditures was within the U.S. Not only do these investments in datacenters, machines and offices allow us to provide great services to users, they have a strong positive impact on the communities around them, supporting thousands of jobs and countless local businesses.
I want to say a big thank you to all of Googlers around the world who help us deliver on that mission every day.
And then with respect to your comments on YouTube, we're starting to hear from advertisers that there is some blurring between brand and direct response ad budgets as they look at products maybe more across blended lines.
And I look at my personal use cases that are many times now sometimes instead of search, actually find something I want to do in YouTube, maybe thinking about going to a place.
Our ads leadership comes Ã¢ÂÂ Prabhakar who has taken over our ads product and engineering efforts, someone I worked with for many, many years, and most recently has led our G Suite business, but has done many roles before, is a deep computer scientist.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Sundar, can you help us better understand how the remedy in Europe will work in terms of licenses and TAC going forward?
So as you guys roll out more products like Lens and Gboard and some of these other utilities on top of your 1 billion-plus apps like search and YouTube, is there any way to parse out what the overall engagement looks like in markets like the U.S. and Western Europe when the phones are improving their functionality and can you keep adding these additional utilities?
But I'm wondering if you could share with us an update maybe on the partner momentum and direct sales momentum you're seeing in the market, how you've seen that change?
And also if you could highlight, if you've noticed if there's been noticeable changes in win rates over the last year as the product continues to mature.
As you look out two or three years, do you think any of these businesses could really make a financial positive difference on the bottom line for overall Google?
Our revenues in the third quarter continued to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, cloud and desktop search, resulting in consolidated revenues of $33.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency.
For today's call, I will begin with the results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes.
The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing head count primarily for cloud and ads followed by advertising investments in cloud, Chromebooks for the back-to-school season and the Google Assistant.
We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum in our advertising businesses as we apply our strength in machine learning to improve the experience for users and advertisers.
Looking ahead, we expect seasonal impacts to our other cost of sales from hardware sales which are typically higher in the fourth quarter of the year as well as from increased content acquisition costs for YouTube, which have also historically been higher in the fourth quarter.
We are continuing to invest in adding talent to our priority areas, particularly for technical roles in engineering and product management and to support our most sizable growth areas, in particular, cloud.
And finally, with respect to CapEx, you can see our continued investment as we build the infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see across our businesses.
Before I wrap up, I want to quickly call out our continued momentum in Asia as well as the investments that we are making in the U.S. As you can see from our results, revenue growth in APAC remains strong.
We have adapted many of our core products like search, Maps and YouTube to work well for the next generation of users coming online.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions.
Referencing the blog post and some of the changes about how you see the future of search, I wanted to know what some of the key investments you think the company needs to make so that search becomes more visual or relevant and what that might mean tying it back to the business for engagement with your products relevant to that medium to long term.
We are investing in image search and we do have products like Google Maps and Photos which all add to the visual experience.
And then for Ruth, as we start to look ahead to 2019, as you plan for 2019, how are you thinking about the relationship between revenue growth and dollars of operating income growth for next year, particularly if the macroeconomic environment were to become, let's say, less of a tailwind to the broader ads environment as it was this year and in prior years?
And so, and a lot of times that involves thinking across the whole stack, bringing together the entire experience in an integrated way for our users.
So we are investing in the long run because we see it clearly as an important business opportunity for us as well, so both go hand-in-hand.
And beyond that, we're looking at how the market adoption is and we are thoughtfully building a business but we are committed to building and investing for the long run.
We continue to invest here because we see ongoing opportunities in particular as we leverage machine learning to provide better experience for users and for advertisers.
But as we've talked about on prior calls, that's one element of it, and we continue to invest for opportunities that are sizable over the long term.
Sundar has already commented on both hardware and cloud as really important examples, and we think the steps that we're taking, the investments we're making, provide the foundational support for ongoing long-term sustained growth.
Could you just talk a little about how you think about the gaming opportunity for Alphabet, and what you think are the key factors you need to tackle to really build and scale direct-to-consumer facing cloud gaming product.
On your second question, look, we today serve our users on gaming across Google ads but in many ways, right.
And we're particularly excited about the opportunity with machine learning, because it opens up more services and products for users and for advertisers and for enterprise customers.
And so given our view about the long-term potential with these opportunities, we're very focused on ensuring that we have the needed compute capacity to support growth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. So in terms of your first question, we actually felt pretty good about the strength globally, which as I noted in opening comments, across the board, 20% growth in the U.S. on a $15 billion base.
And on your second question, one of the things we clearly see when we make a hardware product like Pixel, in which all the tools and the utilities we build are conveniently there integrated and the experience is great.
Look, I mean, I think on the first thing on e-commerce, maybe really in people, we do see a lot of activity in the vertical on our products, and we see strong growth there as well.
So we are continuing to invest there and we are also driving strong partnerships with the retail sector, both in terms of our shopping experiences as well as through cloud.
And on your broader question, look, the reason we are investing across Google and Alphabet in a set of areas is because as a company over the past 20 years, we have developed deep capabilities in technology, in computer science and especially with machine learning and AI.

google,q4,2018,"[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations.
Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights after which we will take your questions.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter: our total revenues of $39.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $724 million or $600 million after the impact of our hedging program.
APAC revenues were $6.1 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 32% in constant currency, reflecting weakness of the Australian dollar.
Our effective tax rate was 11.2% for the fourth quarter, reflecting a discrete benefit due to the reversal of an accrual made as a result of updated guidance associated with the U.S Tax Act. Net income was $8.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $12.77.
I'll cover results for the full-year 2018 because it remains most instructive to look at the financials for Other Bets over a longer-term horizon, as we've discussed on prior calls.
For the full-year 2018, Other Bets revenues were $595 million, up 25% versus 2017 primarily generated by Fiber and Verily.
In terms of gross margin, the biggest component within cost of revenues remains our traffic acquisition costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business.
And our core area such as search maps new use YouTube under computing and advertising platforms continue their strong momentum.
Thanks to our strengths in AI and Search, Google Lens uses your smartphone camera to help identify more than 1 billion products.
YouTube continues to invest in its thriving community of creators and build great features for its nearly 2 billion monthly log in users.
Ariana Grande's premiere of her official music video for Thank U, Next in November holds the record for biggest music video debut in YouTube history earning over $55 million views in its first day.
Since the product launch in March 2018 over 30% of the advertisers who use TrueView for action were new to buying inc and video ads on YouTube.
It was another record year for our Google home family of devices, with million sold this holiday season.
For example, people use Google home devices to cook over 16 million recipes this holiday season.
Google Cloud is a fast-growing multibillion-dollar business that supports major global 5,000 companies in every important vertical with a robust enterprise organization.
There is an important long-term investment that lay the groundwork for our future computing needs primarily to x-rayed machine learning across our businesses.
More than 20 years in there is still tremendous opportunity for Google to help people save time, learn new things, grow their businesses and build stronger communities.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.
But I was wondering if maybe you can share with us what youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in terms of year-over-year growth rate, and in particular are they growing faster than what the competitors disclosed in their public results?
It sounds like on branded advertising and now some of these new direct response ads.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Do you think thatÃ¢ÂÂs the right long-term rate for Google Play?
And IÃ¢ÂÂm just curious that it seems like the core is very strong, but is there hesitation that youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in terms of valuation or other factors that are playing into that relative to what your peers are doing right now?
We have a strong 2018, with total revenues of $136.8 billion, up 23% over 2017, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing investments to deliver exceptional experiences for users and compelling returns for our advertisers, partners and enterprise customers.
For the fourth quarter, revenues of $39.3 billion or up 22% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency, as we continue to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud and Desktop Search.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $17.9 billion, up 26% year-on-year.
The key drivers were: first, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, mostly for our advertising supported content in what is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV which have higher CAC as a percentage of revenues.
Growth in Sales and marketing expenses reflect increases in sales and marketing headcount primarily for Cloud and Ads followed by advertising investments mainly in Search and the Assistant.
Other revenues for Google were $6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year fueled by Cloud, Hardware and Play.
The increase in the sites' TAC rate year-over-year was driven by the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, followed by changes in partner agreements offset by the seasonally higher proportion of YouTube advertising revenues in the fourth quarter.
With eight products, with more than 1 billion users each and more people coming online every day, we remain excited by the opportunities to continue to create valuable experiences for users around the globe.
Machine learning is also driving differentiation for newer Google businesses, like Cloud and Hardware, as well as central to a number of Other Bets, most notably Waymo and Verily.
First, as weÃ¢ÂÂve said many times, we continuously work to enhance the user and advertiser experience because we make changes with a focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long-term, the timing of the introduction of new experiences, particularly, in search advertising can vary which can result in an impact on quarterly year-on-year growth.
In addition to our progress in AI we saw great traction across newer areas, like the Google assistant, hardware, and Cloud.
As we do this, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to do the right thing and are continuing to build privacy and security into the core of our products, keeping uses data safe and secure with the industry's best security systems and giving people better and clearer controls.
The Google assistant is a great example of how we help people throughout the day and we demonstrated that at CES last month with lots of exciting new partners and features.
I want thank every Googler around the world for making 2018, a great year for users and our business.
On the YouTube question, of course, our core effort is around the main YouTube product and that is what works at scale globally across the world and we are seeing continued engagement and it's doing very well.
And then in terms of revenue it's an investment in YouTube, overall, as Sundar said, we are --YouTube is continuing to benefit from the secular change the way users are consuming content and that's reflected in strong revenue growth.
It's growing at a strong pace and as I said in opening comments, we're particularly excited about the significant growth in direct response both TrueView for action and app promo formats are delivering a great value for users and advertisers, and that's driving growth across regions and channels.
Ruth did, I think, in terms of headcount growth in technical and sales roles and for the new leadership that you mentioned what is the things that the new -- that Thomas Kurian can kind of do Cloud to accelerate the next phase of growth in that business.
So, in terms of growth, Cloud does continue to deliver sizable revenue growth driven by GCP and GCP does remain one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet.
I was curious, Sundar, as you think about with an innovation focus, what do you see as being one or two of the biggest opportunities to further improve the quality or the efficacy of the ad product, you provide for advertisers on YouTube from here.
For example, if you look at something like the Google Home Hub and how it delivers a nice experience across Search, Assistant and YouTube and Photos when you wanted, you can definitely see the glimpse of the future.
We see users come to Google a lot around key shopping moments and we want to make sure we invest in the experience to get closer to what they want.
The main point is we remain very excited about the opportunities for users and advertisers, in particular, building off of Sundar's comment as we apply machine learning to solutions.
We know there's a lot of investment in Cloud and hardware and YouTube TV, but just would like to get a update on the health of the advertising business margins.
So, in terms of overall Google margins, I think that the main point you're seeing in the margins as we continue to see tremendous opportunity across Google, and so we're investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth.
We are continuing to see tremendous opportunity in the ads business, Search and Ads businesses and beyond machine learning we're further investing to continue to enhance the experience for users and advertisers, and that's across Mobile Desktop and YouTube.
And then, we are investing aggressively in our newer businesses within Google, particularly, Cloud and Hardware as Sunder has already said.
So what you're seeing reflected through in the margins on the cost of revenue side is the impact of the product mix that weÃ¢ÂÂve talked about, a big part of that is the ongoing strength in YouTube and then on the OpEx side investing in engineers, in particular, for Google as well as on the sales and marketing side, the increased headcount to support not just Ads, but in particular Cloud.
And then in terms of the pace of investments, IÃ¢ÂÂve already laid out the focus areas and our commitment to continue to invest to support long-term revenue and earnings growth and just wanted to put a fine point on both CapEx and headcount.
So with the scale of our business and with our focus on user experience, it does require CapEx. We are committed to continue to invest in CapEx to deliver on that.
So the reason I started by laying out, I think, in response to the question on margins where we're investing and how we look at is, we are very focused on investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth.

google,q1,2019,"Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.
The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher TAC as a percentage of revenues.
Operating expenses including the impact of the EC fine were $13.7 billion.
Google Cloud Platform remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet with strong customer momentum reflected in particular in demand for our compute and data analytics products.
What gives us these opportunities as GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs position to help people, businesses and society in countless ways through our products.
Just last week, we announced an improved job search experience in the U.S., that helps people easily discover quality remote jobs, allowing them to work right from home.
As one example, earlier this year YouTube announced changes that reduce recommendations of content that comes close to violating our guidelines or that misinforms in harmful ways.
More broadly, across our Ads business, our advertising product team led by Prabhakar continues to build new products for marketers, with more than 100 enhancements introduced every quarter.
Philip on our business teams had done a great job helping advertisers take full advantage of these new capabilities.
For instance, more than 70% of our advertisers are already using automated bit strategies and Google Ads and these MO powered technologies help customers get better results for their investments.
In Q1, we began testing new shoppable ad units and Google Images so brands can highlight multiple products available for sale in sponsored image results.
Not only our features like Night Sight in Pixel winning industry awards, but Net Promoter Scores tell us that many people who use our hardware products truly love them, which is particularly important as we move into this new era of computing.
We also announced innovations across many of our other products that enabled developers to build and deploy AI, help enterprises to better secure their data, allow Android users to leverage their phones as a security key and much more.
Today, a Google data center uses 50% less energy than a typical data center, while delivering seven times more computing power than we did five years ago.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.
We noticed that large than expected slowdown in the properties TAC in the quarter that includes cost of mobile search, while the other cost of revenues which includes YouTube content cost seem to maintain an expected growth rate despite what you said about more moderate turns in hardware.
So just wondering if thatÃ¢ÂÂs a wise way to infer anything about the relative performance of mobile search revenue versus YouTube from those cost lines in the quarter?
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
I am excited that over the last three years, taking AI first approach we have really incorporated machine learning core -- in a core way across our product to benefit our users and thatÃ¢ÂÂs true for advertising as well.
But how much of the deceleration insights ex-FX was from maybe advertiser demand issues in these markets versus proactive changes that you may have made on your end to the product?
In the first quarter, total revenues of $36.3 billion were up 17% year-on-year and up 19% in constant currency, following a strong 2018.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment results, were $16 billion, up 19% year-on-year.
Network revenues were $5 billion up 8% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth AdMob followed by Google Ad Manager.
The Sites TAC rate was flat year-over-year, as the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC was offset by the growth in TAC free Sites revenue primarily from YouTube.
In terms of our key revenue drivers, with respect to Sites revenues, as we indicated last quarter, the timing of product changes in ads at times can have an impact on year-on-year growth rates.
We remain confident about the sizable opportunity ahead to improve the advertiser and user experience through our ongoing commitment to product innovation, in particular by leveraging machine learning across our ads products and properties.
Turning to profitability, with regard to Google OpEx, the first quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long-term.
In terms of sales and marketing, the pace of investment in Q1 reflected a timing shift in spend and we expect these expenses to pick up in the second quarter.
We continue to expect a sizable investment in both compute requirements to support long-term growth, as well as in office facilities.
We will always be a company thatÃ¢ÂÂs focus on the long-term willing to make investments that will help our businesses and our customerÃ¢ÂÂs businesses succeed as technology continues to evolve.
Today, I will start by talking about our core mission of making information universally accessible and useful, then I will provide an update on our computing video and advertising platforms, and finally, I will discuss our hardware and cloud efforts.
As part of our Google news initiative, we kicked off the local experiments project, working with local publishers to uncover new approaches to their business models and operations, so they can continue bringing great local content to the readers.
And then more to your question as we indicated last quarter, the other item is the timing of product changes in Ads can impact year-on-year growth rates and we make changes with the focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long-term we do not manage by quarter, so we are introducing enhancements only after product testing, and that was sort of the overarching color that I was trying to give you.
So, starting with clicks and CBCs. And so while YouTube Clicks continue to grow at a substantial pace in the first quarter, the rate of YouTube Click growth decelerated versus what was a strong Q1 last year reflecting changes that we made in early 2018, which we believe are overall additive to the user and advertiser experience.
And then in terms of your two spending the investment questions, in terms of headcount, first, we do continue to expect the growth rate to moderate slightly in 2019 from the year-on-year growth in 2018.
And so cloud has been and continues to be the primary area of headcount growth and as Thomas indicated as well, I think Sundar did as well.
But, overall, we continue to invest meaningfully in our technical infrastructure given our outlook for compute requirements to support long-term growth.
And this quarter, the constant TAC rate versus last year reflects ongoing growth in mobile, but it also benefited from growth in YouTube, where the associated content and cost are included in other cost of sales, and so, thatÃ¢ÂÂs the most important thing to point to.
And so we are having conversations across the Board and I think people are definitely engaging in a very committed way and they are investing in it and so itÃ¢ÂÂs up to us to bring it all together and have a compelling service later this year and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what the team has had done working on.
And just so we can understand a little bit, can you just help us with the key user experience you are trying to solve for and sort of the message to your advertisers who maybe spending -- or maybe growing their spend last now and why itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be positive for the long-term?
Really, just help us understand how that hardware business is important to Google and how you are thinking about it long-term?
So in terms of the Mobile Search and the SiteÃ¢ÂÂs revenue more broadly, I think, the main point, as we have both tried to indicate in opening comments is, we view the advertising opportunity is significant, given, in particular, the opportunity with machine learning, both for users and advertisers, as well as our commitments to product innovation and being the backdrop of an environment, which nearly half of the budgets in the U.S. are still spent offline and about 90% of commerce in the U.S. is still offline and we are focused on digital playing bigger role in that and tapping into other marketing budgets, by offering an attractive ROI.
And then more broadly, within YouTube, as we talked about last quarter, we do continue to see significant growth in direct response and we remain excited about the upside potential there.
And so for -- computing will continue to evolve even beyond phones and so we want to make sure we are in there and we are very committed to it for the long-term.
So in terms of the regions, the year-on-year growth rates reflect the product comments that I have made with respect to the first quarter.
And I donÃ¢ÂÂt think there are any demand issues to the last part of your question, and as we said earlier, we work through a set of product development pipeline in a very disciplined way focused on user experience and that makes itÃ¢ÂÂs way too and thatÃ¢ÂÂs how we approach it.

google,q2,2019,"Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures maybe considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
We made several big announcements at I/O, YouTube's Brandcast, and Google Marketing Live.
Google Maps can also help people stay safe in times of crisis.
Last month, we added more visual information and a new navigation warning system to help you understand where the natural disaster is and better anticipate where it may be headed.
Building a more helpful Google for everyone means that everyone should be able to access and enjoy our products.
Demand across our helpful Home products continues to increase as we expand to new markets.
At Brandcast, we introduced two important changes that help advertisers reach new audiences with premium content.
Moving from YouTube to broader advertising platforms, at Google Marketing Live we introduced new ad formats such as Discovery ads, which offer a new visually rich mobile-first ad experience across Google properties.
Anthos, announced earlier this year, provides advanced security and open architecture to support multi-and hybrid Cloud environments.
That's important to many companies, including financial services customers like HSBC and new clients such as KeyBanc.
Finally Google Cloud's AI and ML solutions are also helping healthcare organizations, like Sanofi, accelerate drug discovery and as such, improve the healthcare experience and outcomes.
Finally, to support our rapidly growing cloud customer base and all of Google services globally, we broke ground on three data centers and launched our new Osaka Cloud region, the seventh in Asia Pacific.
And right here at home, we announced a $1 billion investment in housing across the Bay Area to help address the chronic shortage of affordable housing.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses.
In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search.
Other revenues for Google were $6.2 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fuelled by Cloud with an ongoing strong contribution from Play.
G Suite continues to be a valid set of productivity and work transformation apps with the results benefiting from both new pricing and seed growth.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.9 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities and data centres followed by service.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
I think what's notable here is that every year at GML, we announced new changes to products and features and most ads product launches are introduced in phases as advertisers initially experiment with new formats.
And so I just wanted to add in here because while we're excited about the new ads products we announced to GML last quarter, given they offer great new user experiences across new services, we don't view this year's slate of launches differently from introductions made in previous years.
Growth in GCP was led by strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products and G Suite continues to deliver strong growth, as I noted in the opening comments, with the results benefiting from both new pricing and [C] [ph] growth.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC.
I guess with that as a backdrop with the overall acceleration, can you just give us a couple examples, what types of products or advertisers segments or regions resonate particularly well on YouTube this quarter versus last quarter?
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.
And then just second coming back to Google Marketing Live notwithstanding your comments Ruth that it take some time for products to be adopted.
And our next question comes from Mark May from Citi.
And I was hoping you might provide a couple of specific examples of how the company is leveraging machine learning recently to help drive growth and improvements for both users and advertisers?
First off, as you embrace more commerce and payments on the platform broadly speaking along with the new ad formats you've talked about, can you also talk about what role take rates might play in terms of future initiatives and revenue growth?
To make products work even harder for you, we have continued to invest in our hardware business, bringing together the best of Google's hardware, software, and AI.
Now on to our Cloud business, Q2 was another strong quarter for Google Cloud, which reached an annual revenue run rate of over $8 billion and continues to grow at a significant pace.
We continue to build our world-class cloud team to help support our customers and expand the business and are looking to triple our salesforce over the next few years.
Ahead of the games, we are working with the City of Tokyo to ensure Japanese businesses can better serve new customers and help visitors make the most of their time there using products like Search, Maps and Translate.
The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centres and other operations, including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues.
Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within network, namely Google Ad Manager followed by AdMob. Within Cloud, growth in GCP was once again in the primary driver of performance, with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products.
The sites TAC rate increased year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, offset by the growth in TAC free sites revenues, primarily from YouTube.
With respect to Sites revenues, the strength in the second quarter again reflects our ongoing innovation in part from the benefits of applying machine learning.
In fact, in the second quarter of 2019, as Sundar mentioned, the annual run rate for Cloud revenues was over $8 billion and Cloud continues to deliver significant growth.
In terms of our hardware business, we were pleased with the reception of the Pixel 3a line-up of mid-tier smartphones in the second quarter and look forward to the fourth quarter launch of our newest devices, some of which we showcased at I/O.
With regard to Google operating expenses, the second quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long-term.
Our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments.
Can you give us a little bit of additional color on what some of the key investments you're making, some of the key themes you're trying to drive after in terms of pushing the organization to collaborate on product launches and leveraging the strength within Google?
Beyond that be it, the focus on cloud has been a big part of it, continuing to scale up YouTube including being focused on content responsibility.
And I do think they go hand-in-hand as we are making the experience better for customers, including on products like Discover.
And the key point that I'll just reiterate is that as much as there is a lot of innovation going on in the business and we've talked about that, we introduced product changes only after extensive testing and that means there can be variability in quarterly growth rates as you've seen.
And as we discussed last quarter, there can be timing variability and our view is let's ensure that we stay focused on the right things for the long-term and the quality that we can deliver.
The primary thing is we remain focused on investing for long-term growth and the primary use of capital really is to support that growth.
So in terms of YouTube growth, just maybe to add a bit more there given your question.
And so the click and CPC growth are unrelated to actions on policy enforcement in terms of our ongoing efforts to protect the YouTube ecosystem, we do remain focus and taking the right steps in line with our goals, regardless of impact on the revenues.
I think earlier Ruth had mentioned the importance of machine learning for driving growth in the quarter, and I'm sure in many recent quarters.
Getting a lot of questions and wondering, if you think about that, really affecting Google operations.
We are very focused on investing to support the ongoing growth we see across Google in particular as we're talking about in Search while we're also investing to build new businesses most notably in Cloud as we've talked a lot about here today.
But the mega point is that we are excited about the long-term opportunity and we're continuing to invest which is why in opening comments, I wanted to make sure to call out what we're seeing with respect to ongoing investments and across the business the increases in headcount and the reasons for them at the benefits of those investments as well as sales and marketing and the fact that that is back half loaded and -- back half weighted I should say.
We are committed to continue to invest for what we see as a long-term opportunities.
And on the mobile question, we are definitely investing in Android with a focus on the next billion users as well as making sure the mobile experience continues to evolve.
So, being helpful to users and helping them navigate it be it Search, Assistant, Maps, and YouTube I think we are focused on the opportunities there.
And in terms of the next billion users there's a lot of headroom there over time and we are focused on.
",50.8,0.8164982
google,q3,2019,"Q3 was another great quarter at Google with strong revenue growth driven by mobile search, YouTube, and Cloud.
First, powered by our long-term investment in AI, we dramatically improved our understanding of the questions people ask Google Search.
In Search, we made a number of improvements to make it easier for users to find key moments in videos, easily find products within images via Google Lens, and discover new podcast.
This quarter, we expanded inventory for our very popular App Campaigns to include new services, including YouTube search, display video ads and the Discover feed.
Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.6 billion, up 23% year-on-year.
Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $7.2 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities and data centers, followed by servers.
As weÃ¢ÂÂve often discussed, we manage our business for the long term and not on a quarterly basis, and we remain very-focused on continuing to enhance the experience for users and advertisers over the long term.
Looking forward, we anticipate the primary driver of CapEx investment will continue to be our expected compute requirements, particularly to support ongoing demand for machine learning across our business as well as for Cloud, Search and YouTube.
Can you just talk about what some of the key investments you want to make to capitalize on that opportunity into long-term?
In general, local is an important area for us, and we are continuing to invest in building experience that connects merchants, advertisers and users.
Can you just talk about some of the KPIs that you monitor or what you're seeing when it comes to query volumes, click through rate, overall response time, what are you seeing that sort of gives you confidence that youÃ¢ÂÂll continue to get more and more relevant results for your users?
And I think one of the things that weÃ¢ÂÂve been very focused on is that innovations that benefit mobile also enhance the desktop experience for users and advertisers.
But, to give you a sense of -- we continue to take that work deeper, we realize users sometimes do searches through sessions understanding what is their satisfaction across the session, what is their engagement, are they getting at what they are looking for?
So, as we look out towards like 2020 and beyond, do you feel like a lot of the product queue is in a good place, as far as Search and YouTube are concerned, and that these product changes might be a little bit more subtle going forward, or could we return to having more meaningful impact in the future, just any color there?
So, in terms of the first question, I think, as Sundar and I talked about, we're pleased with the strength of the business that you've seen here again in the third quarter.
And I think to your question, our view is that quarterly growth around the rates you've seen since the beginning of the year, for us underscore the strength and the vibrancy actually in our business.
And we are continuing to invest in long-term opportunities.
But, I think also implicit in your question, at 26% year-on-year growth on a fixed FX basis, running it about now $7 billion in quarterly revenues, weÃ¢ÂÂre really pleased with all what the team is doing and the year-on-year growth rate.
So, these are -- we want to be helpful to users in a way that makes sense for them, more continually, and the combination of Search and Discover helps us do that.
It really cuts across every element of what we do, what weÃ¢ÂÂre doing in our technical infrastructure, the way weÃ¢ÂÂre thinking about our products that Sundar talked about, what we're doing with our facilities, what we're doing with AI.
Given our outlook in particular across Google, we do expect to see ongoing demand for compute investments to support our growth, particularly for machine learning, Cloud, Search and YouTube.
And the primary driver of the CapEx does continue to be our expectations for compute requirements, so investments in technical infrastructure, as we've talked about today.
So, overall, I think, engaging users with premium offerings on YouTube is the focus for us.
That does continue to reflect the changes that we made in early 2018 to really improve the user and advertiser experience.
Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

The biggest contributor again this quarter was costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues.
Within Cloud growth in GCP was once again the primary driver of performance with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products, complemented by ongoing growth in G Suite, reflecting both new pricing and seat growth.
Within other revenues, in addition to continued strength in compute, Google Cloud saw substantial growth from data analytics as customers are seeing the benefits from implementing BigQuery.
[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
I know thatÃ¢ÂÂs for marketing earlier in the year that that seems like that's now at a stage where it's going to be better integrated into the -- I don't know, the purchase path or whatever, you're making it easier for small businesses to tap into what should be really nicely qualified leads.
And then, maybe just elaborate a bit on the long-term vision of moving shopping functionality into properties like YouTube and how you think that experience will evolve?
Obviously Search is an important area, Image Search, YouTube, Maps all great surfaces by which I think users come with varying degrees of commercial interest, looking to discover and at times transact as well.
But, I'm wondering how do you think about the increase in scrutiny and oversight possibly impacting your ability to explore new services or new markets over time, and ultimately to remain competitive?
So, markets like APAC continue to be bit long term opportunities for us as well.
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.
Sundar spoke at length about your investments in renewable energy earlier and maybe keeping with the theme of the earnings call, you could help us understand how that is or maybe is not helping drive efficiencies across the country -- across the Company and your operating costs overall?

Given our position as a challenger, weÃ¢ÂÂre investing aggressively focused on building out our go-to market capabilities, executing against our product roadmap and extending the global footprint of our infrastructure focused on 21 markets and six industries.
We have been investing heavily in developing our capabilities in hardware engineering, as well as building out supply and physical distribution chains and weÃ¢ÂÂve created a multibillion-dollar revenue business in the past three years.

And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Definitely under Thomas' leadership, I think we have clearly focused on six industry verticals across 21 markets and so doubling down on those efforts, bringing in a lot of new products and compliance certification, so effectively expanding the TAM, which we serve.

Search and other Google properties continue to drive great results with total revenues in 2019 of $98 billion and strong growth.
Google Cloud ended 2019 at a more than $10 billion run rate, up 53% year-on-year, driven by significant growth in GCP.
As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased with YouTube's growth in advertising and subscriptions and we are also pleased with the early results from other revenue options we offer creators, including memberships, brand integrations, merchandise, and ticket sales.
This means optimizing our usage of computing resources and also growing business opportunities in areas like YouTube, Cloud, Play, hardware and beyond.
Our results were driven by ongoing strength in Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud offset by a decline in hardware revenues.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles, including the impact of the Looker acquisition, which closed in December.
Google Search and other advertising revenues were 27.2 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing momentum in mobile and desktop.
YouTube advertising revenues were 4.7 billion, up 31% year-on-year, driven by substantial growth in direct response and ongoing healthy growth and brand advertising, which remains the largest component.
Revenues were 2.6 billion for the fourth quarter, up 53% year-over-year, driven by significant growth at GCP and ongoing strong growth and G Suite.
In the fourth quarter, other revenues were 5.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube and Play offset by declines in hardware.
What's exciting for us as we look ahead at Search and other Google properties is the ongoing opportunity to support users and advertisers with new ads experiences and improved measurement.
Second, with respect to YouTube advertising, at a year-on-year growth rate more than 30% in the fourth quarter weÃ¢ÂÂre pleased with the ongoing strength and opportunity at YouTube.
As Sundar shared earlier, the non-advertising services at YouTube, mainly from subscriptions reached a $3 billion revenue run rate in the fourth quarter.
Within technical infrastructure, the investments in particular support ongoing demand for machine learning across our business, as well as for Cloud, Search, Ads, and YouTube.
Sundar, to you first Ã¢ÂÂ a lot of innovation that company put on display over the past year, Ruth talked in her sort of forward commentary section about sustainability of growth and outperformance going forward.
When I look at Ã¢ÂÂ we do see a lot of commercial experiences across our properties, be it Search or YouTube and the opportunity to create a better experience there and hence bring more value to our users.
And across our businesses be it YouTube, Cloud, Play, or hardware in addition to search, you know we are seeing strength in a lot of these areas and we share a common technological approach across all of them.
And then on your second question, at our scale, we're pleased with the rate of growth in 2019 here in Search and our ads business overall and we do see ample opportunity ahead.
When we look at the biggest investment areas within Google, we, as we've talked about already on this call, continue to be focused on investing to support the growth that we see.
When we make it contextually relevant, what we have done in Search and search ads over time, if we can bring that to YouTube when we see an opportunity, I think that sets us up well for the long term there.
So, last year, we set up a core infrastructure team, which looks at things like how does the user journey work across, what does the shared infrastructure engineers can use so that we don't reinvent the wheel in multiple areas, how can we commonly deploy AI across all these products?
Google Assistant is a great example of Ã¢ÂÂ because we are focused on the user and the experience cuts across several of our product areas.
However, the point that we were trying to make and have made a couple of times here on the call is we are investing aggressively in Cloud overall given the opportunity that we see and the momentum we're having and we'll continue to do so.
We're putting a sharper focus on this, as Sundar indicated, looking at where does it make sense to work with external capital as we did with Verily as an example, but the bigger point is, we continue to invest for the long term, and when we look at our capital return approach, it's very consistent with what we've talked about previously.
The primary use of capital continues to be to support long-term growth in Google and in Other Bets, and then it's about strategic investments and on top of that return of capital to shareholders.
And as you said, the other cost of sales does reflect lower expenses related to Hardware in Q4, in particular, versus last year, but I think the main point to leave you with is that we do intend to continue to invest aggressively to support growth in the areas that we've already talked about quite a bit on this call, in Search, in Cloud, in Hardware and in YouTube.
And he mentioned the transactional part of the funnel and I think it's an area where he brings a lot of experience given his prior work, but we definitely see opportunity to improve the overall user experience in terms of how we present our results, the visual nature of it, making that experience more delightful.

google,q1,2020,"Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Ultimately, weÃ¢ÂÂll see a long-term acceleration of movement from businesses to digital services, including increased online work, education, medicine, shopping and entertainment.
This is a testament to strategic areas where we have invested over recent years, products that people trust, our technical leadership and innovation, deep partnerships, a highly skilled workforce, and the scale and resilience of our operations.
And finally, creating sustainable value, weÃ¢ÂÂll be optimizing the way our data centers work and prioritizing strategic areas of investment where we need to support our users and partners.
At the same time, even through March, our non-advertising revenue lines maintain their strong performance, particularly Google Cloud.
IÃ¢ÂÂll provide more details on the impact of the crisis as I review the Google segment revenue results and conclude with an update to the outlook that I shared on our fourth quarter call.
In the first quarter, our total revenues were $41.2 billion, up 13% year-on-year and up 15% in constant currency, driven by Search, YouTube and Cloud.
Starting with Google Search and other advertising revenue, we generated $24.5 billion in revenues in the quarter that was up 9% year-over-year.
As a result by the end of March, total YouTube ads revenue growth had decelerated to a year-on-year growth rate in the high-single-digit.
In the first quarter, other revenues were $4.4 billion, up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues and play.
Within Play, app revenues continue to benefit from strong growth in the number of active buyers in the first quarter.
Let me now conclude with our thoughts on the impact of the global crisis on our revenues and investments including an update on the outlook I shared on our fourth quarter earnings call.
In terms of Google Cloud, we remain very pleased with the execution by the team, reflected in the ongoing pace of customer adoption of both GCP industry-specific solutions and G Suite collaboration tools to help businesses operate efficiently and effectively.
Although we are focused on these and other steps to moderate the overall pace of investment, we remain committed to the long-term opportunities for which we are well positioned, so we will continue to invest in these areas, including Search, Machine Learning and Google Cloud.
So across everything we do, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Play, be it Cloud, I think we are investing to capitalize on this long term opportunity.
First, I wanted to thank you for the color around the growth youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing as you were exiting the quarter in the ad business.
Thank you for the Ã¢ÂÂ so, in terms of ads revenue, as I said in opening comments, for our ads business a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance, which has tended to be correlated with ad spend.
And then, with YouTube, we had strong revenue growth until late in the quarter when trajectories for direct response and brand diverged.
And as I said, direct response does continue to have substantial growth throughout the quarter while brand began to experience a sizable headwind starting in mid-March.
That being said, the decline in our Search and other ads revenue was abrupt in March and although weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing some early signs at this point that users are returning to more commercial behavior, itÃ¢ÂÂs not clear how durable or monetizeable that will be.
In terms of overall priorities, I would say, weÃ¢ÂÂve always taken a long-term Ã¢ÂÂ on thinking through the arc of where things are going and our deep focus on AI, itÃ¢ÂÂs an example of that and weÃ¢ÂÂve been convinced for a while that those trends will play out in the long-term and so if anything through moments like that, the strong foundation we have built allows us to continue to be able to invest in our long-term area so AI is a good example of it.
Cloud and productivity software for businesses of all sizes is a deep area of investment and so the thesis still main so we continue to focus anywhere we think the actual work we are doing is based on deep technology, deep computing, a deep computational scale is the kind of investments we think still stand the test of time through things like, but beyond that we are actively looking at how user patterns are emerging so, for example, e-commerce is an area and you saw us respond through this with the changes we announced on our shopping property and going for comprehensiveness there and with new leaders in place weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be making sure we work on the user experience there.
And then Sundar, just to go back to your comments about the shift toward digital opportunities or digital transformation, if you talk to us about as you sort of look back over the last couple years at what youÃ¢ÂÂve done on the SMB side and what are sort of one or two of the key hurdles where you see you really need to invest and build more comprehensive SMB products for post recovery?
On the Ad side, a question Ã¢ÂÂ to your question about maybe I can give more qualitative cover to what was said earlier and we Ã¢ÂÂ the good thing about search ads and direct response on YouTube as well, but Search primarily is that, itÃ¢ÂÂs an extraordinarily effective system, itÃ¢ÂÂs a transparent system, you have a very clear sense of ROI, itÃ¢ÂÂs very measurable, highly cost-effective and so we have always seen and we saw this in 2008 as well, people respond in the short-term, but the recovery is also fast when it comes back and so it tends to work.
I mentioned earlier people are really thinking about the shift to digital so Philip and our ads team are super engaged with our customers helping them think through the opportunities through moments like that.
I earlier talked about, you can imagine, if youÃ¢ÂÂre a customer and you have data centers, these are fixed cost when you go through moments like this and so people are really looking at opportunities there and so our teams are super engaged, but I do want to acknowledge, maybe small businesses across the world are deeply impacted.
As a company we have announced several efforts to support small and medium businesses and we are going to be deeply engaged with them, but I think itÃ¢ÂÂs a tough journey we are all on and we look forward to working with them to help them through this.
So, going through a moment like this, itÃ¢ÂÂs very clear, part of what makes Google work well is, people come across a diverse range of needs and thatÃ¢ÂÂs true for shopping.
One of the tricky things about when you do that is making sure you donÃ¢ÂÂt have spam and youÃ¢ÂÂre managing and giving people good quality experiences and thatÃ¢ÂÂs where our deeper partnership, be it with PayPal and other providers so that we get the quality signals and really improve the experience as we improve comprehensiveness so both of them are going hand in hand and as we have demonstrated with Search, when we improve the organic experience the advertising experience also gives an opportunity and the system works well and so IÃ¢ÂÂm really excited about this change.
Sundar, the question for you really relates to the resiliency youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing within direct response piece of YouTube, like are there specific factors or is it a question of mix of advertisers there, thatÃ¢ÂÂs sustaining the growth?
On direct response, I do think, I think people are Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs a journey, and people who have been investing are seeing that it is cost effective, and so, over time more people are looking at it.
We have seen that the most pressing concern of small and large businesses right now is business continuity, solving for issues like employee safety, dramatic falls or surges in demand, supply chains and managing a remote workforce.
People are spending significantly more time on their Android apps with downloads of apps from Google Play rising 30% from February to March.
Last week, we surpassed a significant milestone and are now adding roughly 3 million new users each day and have seen a 30-fold increase in usage since January.
Vodafone is using Google Cloud platform to help that analyze network traffic flows to keep everyone connected, and we are helping Unity Technologies keep real time online games stay up and running.
Wing saw a surge in deliveries and new users, increasing its daily volume fivefold with great momentum in test programs in Australia and Virginia.
Our results for the first quarter are a tail of 2 quarters with strong results across our revenue lines for January and February followed by an abrupt decline in March in our advertising revenues, as governments globally instituted stay at home orders in response to COVID-19.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.5 billion, up 26% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses.
The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, and then content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTubeÃ¢ÂÂs advertising supported content followed by content costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube music and premium subscription services.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Significant YouTube revenue growth persisted until late in the first quarter with different performance trajectories for the brand and direct response components.
With respect to the implications of the global crisis for Google Cloud, weÃ¢ÂÂre proud of the accelerated traction we achieved across sectors, including public sector and healthcare for disease monitoring and control, working with leading retailers on demand forecasting working with companies across media and communications to enhance their customer service and across industries on supply chain optimization.
Total Traffic Acquisition Costs were $7.5 billion or 22% of total advertising revenue and up 9% year-over-year.
Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.7 billion, reflecting investments in data centers followed by servers and office facilities.
In terms of more specific product points, I will start with Search advertising where our financial results are driven in part by usersÃ¢ÂÂ search behavior.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Google Meet, have seen great traction and I gave Ã¢ÂÂ I mentioned some user momentum there, but we have more announcements coming up including later this week and so we are seeing tremendous traction and engagement on G Suite.
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been executing well over there for the past year and the growth on Google Pay has been strong and so being able to bring all of that together along with strong players like PayPal et cetera will help us give great experience for our users here.
Did you also see advertisers starting to come back?
