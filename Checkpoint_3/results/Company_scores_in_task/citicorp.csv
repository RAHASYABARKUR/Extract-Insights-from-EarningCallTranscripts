CITI,q2,2015,"Hello, and welcome to Citi's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
In consumer banking, high quality checking deposit growth improve spreads and higher mortgage originations drove revenue growth in the U.S. while weÂve optimized our branch footprint to focus on seven cities.
Citi core expenses were down 1% as ongoing efficiency savings and lower legal and repositioning cost will largely offset by higher regulatory and compliance cost.
Slide 9 shows the results for North America consumer banking.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 11% from last year, reflecting continued loan and checking deposit growth, higher mortgage origination activity and improved deposit spreads.
And retail services revenues were flat to last year with improved spreads being offset by the continued impact of lower fuel prices and higher contractual partner payments.
Over the last 12 months, our consumer efficiency ratio was 54% including overall 150 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges.
Investment Banking revenues of 1.3 billon were down 4% from last year as higher M&A revenues were more than offset by lower underwriting activity as compared to a very strong second quarter last year consistent with overall market trends.
Year-to-date, investment banking revenues were up 4% driven by strong M&A results and we have gained overall wallet versus 2014 particularly in North America.
In constant dollars, lending revenues grew 4% from last year as higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads.
In spread products however, activity levels declined versus last year in credit products in particular resulting in lower revenues.
Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings asset which totaled a $116 billion at quarter end, down 22% from a year ago.
The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing a consistent growth trend year-over-year even as the contribution from Citi Holdings has continued to strength.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
And then maybe one just accounting question on the DTA you used 1.2 billion last quarter, it seems like that dropped the values using up 300 million this quarter, yet looks like North America net income was pretty similar to last quarter, why the balance, why not using more DTAs this quarter?
Your next question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Alright, thanks a lot John.
You know Brennan I donÂt have that particular figure either with me or in my head, so I canÂt answer that question for you right now.
Thanks a lot for all the color John.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
I know just you didnÂt change the overall company expense ratio, so just wanted to see if what you are saying is youÂve got other cost saves even further ahead of plan happening elsewhere in the organization thatÂs funding, this investments spend in consumer or you are saying we see good payback relatively good timeframe and as a result weÂre just going to let this rise up a little bit as reinvesting, weÂll get it back next year?
My question is on how your best in class capital ratios particularly on the leverage is impacting your client conversations in markets.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Good afternoon, gentlemen, thanks for taking my calls - my questions.
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton.
Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
Your next question will come from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities.
With half the year behind us, weÂve remained on track to hit our financial targets in terms of return on assets in our efficiency ratio.
In ICG, weÂve grown our investment banking wallet share year-to-date and our Private Bank continued to show strong rise in revenue growth.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $632 billion as 4% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wine down of Citi Holdings.
Deposits also decreased 1% driven by Citi Holdings including the reclassification of $21 billion of Japan retail deposits to held for sale in the fourth quarter of last year.
Citicorp revenues were up 5% year-over-year mostly driven by growth in our institutional franchise and revenues declined in Citi Holdings reflecting continued asset reductions as well as the impact of classifying our OneMain business as held for sale at the end of last quarter.
And as I just described, we generated positive operating leverage again this quarter in Citicorp with 5% growth in revenues and 1% decline in expenses in constant dollars.
Net income grew 25% year-over-year driven higher revenues, lower operating expenses and an improvement in credit cost, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.
Revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the second quarter, reflecting volume growth, partially offset by spread compression and ongoing regulatory headwinds in certain markets.
In Latin America, we grew revenues 3% driven by modest loan and deposit growth in Mexico, partially offset by the impact of selling our consumer franchise in Honduras last year.
Asia card loans and purchase sales both grew year-over-year by 4% and 5% respectfully but this growth was offset by lower spreads driven by continued higher payment rates and the impact of regulatory changes in certain markets.
Operating expenses declined 5% as lower repositioning cost were partially offset by the impact of volume growth, higher regulatory and compliance cost and technology investments and credit cost declined from last year.
Branded cards revenues of $1.9 billion were down 5% from last year as 5% growth in purchase sales and improved spreads were more than offset by the impact of lower average loans mostly driven by the continued runoff of promotional rate balances and higher payment rates.
We now expect the total consumer efficiency ratio for 2015 to be somewhere in the range of 52% to 53% consistent with our plans to begin gradually increasing the level of investment spend during the second half of the year, primarily in the U.S. branded cards.
Private Bank revenues of 746 million grew 13% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in investments and capital markets products as well as higher loan and deposit balances.
Rates and currencies revenues grew by double digits year-over-year in the second quarter as investor client activity and market volatility were improved versus last year, G10 rates was the key driver of growth.
Excluding the adjustments, equities revenues would have increased by 26% from last year, driven by growth and derivatives, improved trading performance EMEA and strong client momentum in Asia.
Total operative expenses of 4.8 billion grew 2% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance cost were partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation and credit was a positive in the quarter.
We continued to expect to achieve a total ICG efficiency ratio closer to the mid-point of the 53% to 57% target range for the full year 2015.
Revenues were higher year-over-year and sequential, driven mainly by gains on debt buybacks as well as real estate sales in the recent quarter, partially offset by hedging activities and expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs.
Revenues of 1.7 billion declined by over 300 million from last year, driven by the reduction in assets as well as the impact of classifying our OneMain business as held for sale at the end of the quarter.
As I described earlier, as a result of the HFS accounting treatment, approximately $160 million of net credit losses were recorded as a reduction in revenue during the second quarter.
In summary, we continued to make progress in the second quarter with revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Citicorp, lower legal and repositioning expenses and continued favorable credit trends.
But for the full year, we continued to expect to deliver a Citicorp efficiency ratio in the mid 50% range and a Citigroup ROA of over 90 basis points.
Turning to the second half of this year, we continued to expect modest revenue growth in Citicorp.
In consumer, in North America, we expect continued underlying revenue growth in our retail banking franchise, although comparisons for the prior year will be impacted by certain onetime items that benefited our mortgage business last year as previous disclosed.
And the North America cards, revenue will likely remain under pressure in the second half of the year as it will take some time for our incremental investment spend to drive top line results.
In international consumer, we continue to believe we can generate revenue growth and positive operating leverage year-over-year in the second half of 2015, driven by continued modest growth in Mexico as well as continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds in Asia as we begin to lap some of the spread compression and regulatory changes we absorbed last year.
Turning to the institutional franchise, we continued to see good momentum across Corporate Lending, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services and the Private Bank which together generated 8% year-over-year revenue growth in the first half of the year in constant dollars.
Investment banking revenues will depend in part on the overall market, but we continue to feel good about the strength of our franchise generating 4% year-over-year revenue growth in the first half with overall wallet share gains versus 2014.
We expect credit cost to increase somewhat in the second half of the year driven by loan growth as well as lower loan loss reserve releases and we expect to keep balance sheet discipline staying at or below our current size.
May be we could take a little bit just about the expense trajectory from here, you highlighted higher regulatory expenses in some investments in U.S. cards, but maybe you can kind of give us, but youÂve also havenÂt seen much of a decline in markets expenses in the corporate bank yet, seasonally we should expect some decline revenues.
So we think that we are towards the end of that growth cycle, but thatÂs something really for 2016 story, I donÂt see that for the second half of this year.
You know we said mid-50s for this year, could we do something more sure, but you take a look at the progress that weÂve made already, weÂre operating Citicorp at 55%, weÂre operating Citigroup overall with an efficiency ratio of 56%.
Yeah, I mean you know Glenn, what weÂre working to would be to do the best job we can of matching up the cost of the debt buybacks with the gain recognition on OneMain, thatÂs a very much our focus and thatÂs what we are going to try to do.
And I think itÂs a little bit early right now to make comments on the overall tone whatÂs rating will be for the balance of the third quarter, but we managed to work our way through a series of events.
However given where we are in this year and given the fact that we do want to begin to put some additional marketing spend against U.S. branded cards in the third and fourth quarter which we think is the right thing to do from a top line - future top line growth point of view.
Last question from me, thinking about Holdings and the North American mortgage book, as of last quarter, about 24 or so billion of the 54 billion mortgage was second lean which is might saying that itÂs basically not market above, so I am just kind of curious of the remaining roughly 50 billion of mortgage that is first lean.
Obviously we are not doing, OneMain is something that weÂve focused on for some period of time, so that is all part of the holding story and trying to continue to wind down holding, so we would look at that as something is exiting a what is really a good business but if one that just doesnÂt fit with our strategy and Costco we continue to believe that that is something that will be accretive to next year.
You know Mike, let me just jump in for a second because I think itÂs going to be hard for us to give a long term guidance as far as return on assets until we get more clarity around some of the regulatory rules that still need to be set including especially the TLAC.
We need to get the cardÂs franchise back contributing and thatÂs really more matter of just being able to lap those regulatory changes and make sure then that weÂve seen the abatement in the spread pressure that weÂve otherwise been facing, which is why we are more confident on the revenue growth of that franchise going into the second half of the year.
When we take a look at trying to manage Citi, overall Citi to an efficiency ratio, itÂs very much as you say weÂve got several things to look at, the performance of the ICG which from an expense point of view, even at efficiency ratio point of view this year has been quite good.
You know weÂre continuing to do debt issuance if thatÂs request and obviously weÂve matter of fact when we take a look at the amount of preferred and the amount of debt that we issued last question, IÂd say was quite substantial.
So thatÂs why I wanted to make sure you were aware of the fact that itÂs likely to end they have for the full year an efficiency ratio slightly above where I would have said at the last time.
",46.64,0.7767386
CITI,q3,2015,"And despite the revenue headwinds we once again proved our ability to manage our expenses and will remain on track to deliver our full year efficiency and return on asset targets.
We continued to improve the quality of our balance sheet by replacing legacy assets from Citi Holdings with high solid loans in Citicorp.
With one quarter to go we are on track to hit our financial targets in return of assets and our efficiency ratio and we also earned a 10% return on tangible common equity so far this year.
And in branded cards we are seeing growth in active accounts and purchase sales although itÂs going to take some time for the full benefit of our investments in this business to be reflected in our results.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined to 1% year-over-year to 622 billion as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued line down of Citi Holdings.
Citicorp revenues were up slightly year-over-year and Citi Holdings revenues declined by nearly 30% mostly reflecting higher gains on asset sales in the prior year including the impact of selling our consumer operations in Spain and Greece.
As I just described we generated positive operating leverage again this quarter in Citicorp with revenues up slightly and expenses down 13% in constant dollars.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 6% year-over-year driven by lower investment sales revenues as well as continued high payment rates and ongoing regulatory pressure in cards.
We saw an industry wide slow down in activity in Asia during the quarter reflecting changes in consumer sentiment driven by slowing economic growth and the recent volatility in the capital markets.
Card loans still grew modestly year-over-year but this growth was muted by the impact of continued high payment rates.
At less than $3 billion, the Brazil consumer portfolio now represents just 1% of our global consumer loans and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our total consumer cost of credit as we look forward.
In branded cards revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and rewards cost as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products.
Of course this has the revenue growth in cards will take some time and the full benefits of our actions may not be completely reflected in our results for perhaps another two years as we build new loans to offset the continued run off in our legacy products.
Finally, turning to retail services, revenues declined 2% from last year reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices as well as higher contractual partner payments, as we continued to share some of the benefits of higher yields and lower net credit losses with our retail partners.
Turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 12, revenues of 8.4 billion in the third quarter declined 3% from last year.
This represents the seventh consecutive quarter that weÂve generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis.
In constant dollars lending revenues declined 4% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads and the impact of loan sale activity.
Our G10 rates business as roughly flat year-over-year for the quarter but we did see significantly lower than expected revenues in the back half of September.
Turning to equities, excluding the impact of reversing $140 million of the valuation adjustment we recognized in the second quarter, revenues increased by 12% from last year driven by growth in derivatives with particular strength in North America and Asia.
And in security services revenues declined 4% on a reported basis and were up 7% in constant dollars, reflecting increased activity and higher client balances.
We have continued to make great progress in opening down Citi Holdings with signed agreements to selling additional $37 billion of assets, $31 billion of which we currently expect to close in the fourth quarter.
Our net interest margin was 294 basis points in the third quarter, roughly in line with the prior quarter as trading NIM continued to be higher than expected.
Looking to the fourth quarter, our net interest margin will depend on a number of factors including the level of trading them, the timing of expected divestitures in Citi Holdings, and a magnitude in timing of any debt redemption actions.
Three quarters into the year we have an efficiency ratio in Citicorp of 55.4%, a Citigroup ROA of 99 basis points, and we earn the return on tangible common equity of 10%.
We are certainly seeing the impact of slower global growth and macro uncertainty on our top line results, but we feel good about our ability to manage risk through this cycle.
Looking to the fourth quarter, in North America consumer revenues will likely be roughly flat to the third quarter and in international consumer we expect revenue to be slight to slightly higher than last year on a constant dollar basis as we expect continued modest volume growth with Asia revenues beginning to stabilize.
Turning to the institutional franchise, we continue to see good momentum across treasury and trade solutions, security services, and the private bank which together generated 8% year-over-year revenue growth in the first nine months of the year in constant dollars.
Finally for total Citigroup we expect our cost of credit to be roughly flat to the third quarter excluding any impact from the portfolio of sales out of Citi Holdings.
Just the asset sales, 31 billion this quarter, potentially 37 billion in total, can you help us think about the impact on capital ratios when they are done?
Alright Glenn, so again as we have said in the past, and I will give you a bit of a run down, our energy related loans, the total exposure remains about constant to where we were last year at about $60 billion worth of total energy related exposure.
So as you think about the exit level of this year of the net interest margin, essentially a good kind of 1Q 2016 level, just holding rates, holding mix, and holding all that steady how would that NIM compare to the current third quarter NIM or what you are expecting in 4Q?
So in the -- just following up on the Holdings questions in the sale of assets that you expect to close here in the fourth quarter, is there an updated sense about how much of the expense base of Holdings should come out on the back of this?
But if the environment remains difficult, do you have the ability to pull levers and work the efficiency ratio down further from here or are we going to be in a waiting game until the revenues can come through, just how should we think about that?
And the efficiency ratio target that we have put out for Citicorp and we have put this out more than two and half years ago now, when we were looking at what we thought would be a difficult environment in 2015 and the environment has actually proved to be even more difficult I think than we thought at that point in time when we said we can operate overall Citicorp with an efficiency ratio of in the mid 50s.
And it takes a lot of management in this type of environment to continue to operate at that efficiency ratio and still have room to make the investments that you want us to make so that when the environment improves we can generate even higher levels of revenue growth.
Okay, I guess last one from me then if we think about your new card offering how is it that you would recommend we measure success based upon the change, the new products that youÂve put out the Â the offering what metrics would you guys us to look to if some of the components of the environment for revenue remain challenging?
You know core expenses are up slightly and again itÂs in line with the plans that we had going into this year when we thought about what we needed to do in order to generate the efficiency ratios that we were targeting.
So I think it is really, you really need to look at the $108 billion then of credit and market risk assets that are supporting to the holdings as really being the opportunity that we have now for further capital reduction and as we wind down the balance of the holdings.
And then just a follow up question on the international consumer banking side and to your point about flat year-over-year constant dollar, and your comments about the investments sales slowing, any sense if that investments have slow down, was kind of just customers freezing given what was happening this quarter and what are you seeing just in terms of the international consumer activity aside from revenue just in terms of the behavior and activity as you look ahead?
I just wanted to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about it in 2016 where maybe you donÂt have the offset of the holdings run off and you still have continued core growth in Citicorp, should we expect those RWAs to begin to trend on an upward trajectory?
I do believe on the last quarter's call you had said the midpoint of the 53% to 57% target range which is just maybe some upward pressure on the efficiency ratio and I just wanted to guess as to whether that is a reflection of revenue pressures.
I know that revenues on a constant dollar basis were down about 1% year-on-year through the first nine months or more a function of what you are seeing in terms of the performance thus far, maybe your outlook ahead of the fourth quarter?
So, you can assume that this is, I am thinking that we are going to be slightly above where I would have targeted at the end of the last quarter and it very much reflects the revenue pressure that --
Okay and then just lastly on the U.S. credit card environment you mentioned that the two years forward is when with the new accounts you get to a better lending environment obviously because at first you get the new accounts in and they spend and then they borrow, I just wanted to understand was that two years to what you think is average run rate in borrowing or in revolving for the accounts that you are looking for, or is that, when you start to see the beginnings of borrowings.
You know I donÂt want to get into a specific guidance point on loan growth in Citicorp on constant dollars but we do think that again, this quarter it did present certain challenges.
Hello, and welcome to Citi's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Thank you Susan and good morning everyone.
Hey, thank you Mike and good morning everyone.
And deposits were flat versus last year at 904 billion also reflecting 4% growth in Citicorp offset by a decline in Citi Holdings.
In Latin America, excluding the gain of approximately $180 million this quarter on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in Mexico, revenues were roughly flat versus last year as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression.
Card loan balances in Mexico remained under pressure this quarter reflecting both slower economic growth and ongoing shifts in consumer behavior.
Operating expenses grew 1% as higher regulatory and compliance cost and technology investments were mostly offset by lower legal and repositioning cost as well as ongoing efficiency savings.
And credit cost increased 7% from last year driven by our loan loss reserve build in Latin America.
Retail banking revenues of 1.3 billion grew 3% from last year as continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads were partially offset by the impact of $15 million mortgage repurchase reserve release in the prior year.
We expect the investments we are making today to generate higher net interest revenue overtime as growth in active accounts, better customer engagement, and higher purchase sales translated to higher full rate balances.
Total expenses of 2.3 billion in North America declined 6% as incremental investments were more than offset by lower repositioning cost and ongoing efficiency savings, as we have continued to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint.
Total banking revenues of 4 billion excluding the impact of gains on loan hedges were down 7% versus the prior year, mostly reflecting lower investment banking activity.
Debt underwriting revenues were down 17% driven by high yield and leverage loans, products where our core clients were less active this quarter than in the prior year.
Private bank revenues of 715 million grew 8% year-over-year driven by strong growth in managed investments revenue as well as higher loan and deposit balances.
Fixed income revenues of 2.6 billion were down 16% as we saw lower activity levels and a less favorable environment in the recent quarter particularly in securitized products in G10 FX.
The revenue impact was most significant in North America and Western Europe and was partially offset by strong performance again this quarter in our emerging markets franchise where our fixed income revenues grew 4% year-over-year.
Total credit costs were 309 million up sequentially reflecting a net loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release last quarter.
Revenues were higher year-over-year driven primarily by gains on debt buybacks and expenses were down mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs.
Slide 15 shows holdings assets which totaled $110 billion at quarter end, down 20% from a year ago.
Revenues of 1.4 billion declined 32% from last year mostly reflecting lower gains on asset sales as well as divestiture activity.
Expenses also declined driven mainly by the lower assets and cost of credit remains favorable driven by the North American mortgage portfolio where the total NCL rate improved to 1.2%.
The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars showing a consistent growth trend year-over-year even as the contribution from Citi Holdings has continued to shrink.
I know this is not a easy question to answer but if you look at your capital return, payout ratio is still below peers with the improvement in ratios sort of now better than most with asset sales, do you think you can get closer to peer payout ratios next year in CCAR or is there anything else we should be thinking about?
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Okay and then this question is for Mike following up on your comments about using excess capital and trying to avoid the denominator problem.
Great and shifting gears you mentioned in your prepared remarks about card loans, they grew modestly year-over-year but the growth was muted by the impact of continued high payment rates than regulatory changes.
Tangible [ph] rate, thanks John for taking my questions.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
I got it, okay, thanks that was very helpful.
Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions.
Okay, John thanks, thatÂs helpful.
Okay, thatÂs helpful, thanks.
Good, thanks for taking my questions.

CITI,q4,2015,"Overall, our institutional businesses saw improved performance from the fourth quarter of last year.
In Consumer, our North American performance continued to be impacted by investments we're making in our branded cards business, but we saw continued underlying growth and efficiency gains in retail banking.
We had a substantial decrease in Citi Holdings assets during the quarter largely driven by the closing of the sale of OneMain and consumer franchises in several countries.
Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 4% from last year, mostly driven by gains on asset sales in Citi Holdings, as well as growth in our institutional franchise, partially offset by the impact of FX translation.
And net credit losses continued to improve, offset by a significant loan loss reserve build this quarter largely in Citicorp compared to a net release in the prior year.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $618 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 4% to $908 billion.
And cost of credit grew 29% from the fourth quarter of last year driven by the net reserve build.
The net result of these actions was a pre-tax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion this quarter, better than we previously expected, driven by higher net gains on asset sales, as well as improved credit.
While Citi Holdings did outperform our expectations in the fourth quarter, the greatest driver of earnings growth for the full year was our Citicorp franchise.
Citicorp earned $16 billion in 2015, an increase of over $4.8 billion from the prior year, driven by growth in our operating margin, as well as a continued decline in net credit losses, partially offset by the impact of changes in loan loss reserves.
In Latin America, revenues were flat to last year, as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression in cards.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year driven by continued pressure on investment sales revenues, as well as continued high payment rates and ongoing regulatory pressures in cards.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 6% from last year including the impact of $130 million gain on the sale of a mortgage portfolio in the prior period.
In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year, driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and reward costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products.
We continue to feel good about the investments we are making with 8% year-over-year growth in active accounts and 13% growth in purchase sales in our core products.
We achieved modest year-over-year loan growth this quarter in our core portfolios, which account for roughly 80% of our total US branded card loans.
And with continued momentum, we believe we should return to growth in both total loans and revenues in the latter part of 2016 before the benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio.
The total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer banking in 2015 was nearly 54%, above our previous outlook of roughly 53%, driven mostly by lower than expected revenues in our international business, particularly in Asia.
Revenues of $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter grew 4% from last year with broad based growth across the franchise.
Fixed income revenues of $2.2 billion were up 7% from last year with growth in both macro and spread products, but were down 14% from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonally lower activity as well as the impact of continued macro uncertainty.
Turning to equities, revenues grew 29% from a difficult fourth quarter a year ago, driven by growth across products and improved performance in EMEA.
We incurred roughly $75 million of net credit losses on a limited number of credits in the energy portfolio this quarter, about two thirds of which was offset by related reserve releases.
The total efficiency ratio for ICG in 2015 was 56.7%, a little higher than our previous outlook of roughly 56%, mostly driven by lower than anticipated revenues in the fourth quarter, as well as higher repositioning costs.
As of today, we have signed agreements to reduce Citi Holdings GAAP assets by an additional $7 billion in 2016 and we'll continue to pursue other sales as well.
On slide 15, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter, which reflect the net gains on asset sales, as well as the impact of our debt buyback activities, legal and repositioning charges, and other episodic items.
As I described earlier, the net result of these actions was a pre-tax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, greater than we had anticipated, driven by higher net gains on asset sales, as well as improved credit.
As a result, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable in 2016, and the assets should continue to come down as well with a corresponding benefit to RWA.
We should recover about 3 basis points of this impact when we acquire the Costco portfolio which we currently expect to occur closer to the end of the second quarter.
During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12%, driven by net income and a reduction in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by movements in OCI, as well as $1.8 billion of common share buybacks and dividends.
Our DTA balance grew in the fourth quarter by approximately $600 million, driven by movements in OCI, partially offset by operating earnings.
The most significant of these planned investments for 2016 are in US cards, including the continued effort to grow active accounts in A&R and branded cards, which as I said earlier, should allow us to return to growth in both loans and revenues by the latter part of 2016.
Together, we believe these investments are important for growing our cards business and for improving our overall Citicorp efficiency and returns over time.
I think if you look at the last two quarters and then your guidance for the next two, it seems like you're adding, depending on what we assume for charge-offs $1.34 billion of reserves in the corporate book.
And the guidance that I gave you as far as the roughly $600 million worth of cost of credit in the first half of the year, that's really based on a scenario where oil prices remain at the - at least current levels when I walked into this meeting, of around $30 a barrel and staying there for a sustained period.
However, the continued efforts that I just referenced to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet resulted in us actually appearing in the 3.5% bucket by last year end.
We actually feel very good about the way the credit portfolio has performed in Russia over that period of time.
And again, I think that's by and large a theme that you'll hear as I talk about every country and whether I'm talking about consumer or the ICG, is that overall, our very tightly focused customer strategy in each of our businesses gives us a credit portfolio that is quite resilient when it comes to times of trouble.
Those NCLs were offset by reserve releases and again, we feel pretty good about the way the overall portfolio is operating in Brazil.
And again, when you take a look at what's going on in the commercial portfolio certainly outside of Brazil, we've got some deterioration in SMEs. Lower oil prices in particular are a benefit to customers on a broader scale probably than any impact on the SMEs. So we just don't see that there.
And as I had mentioned in response to Glenn's question, even if that were to happen, we still expect our consumer portfolios to be more resilient than the broader market given our focus on higher quality segments, and which we think is really the right strategy for us.
So when you take a look at our EM consumer exposures around the world, we continue to feel good about the underlying credit quality overall.
But could you maybe set for us how we should think about now at this point from where we are, and I know it's a fluid situation because as you announced, you've still got several billion dollars of sales already inked here for 2016.
But what's the right way to think about the revenue and expense rate jumping off point from here in holdings?
The best guidance I can give you, Brennan, is the guidance that I tried to give you during the call, which is think in terms of holdings being marginally profitable on an EBT point of view in each quarter next year.
Yes, our look at holdings, if you take a look at DTA for the full year this year, consistent with what we've said, we got about $2.5 billion of DTA reduction out of our - out of our businesses.
And so that will, you know, especially when you think about the impact on our available for sale securities, those are losses that we need to take today that will largely accrete back to us over time.
A lot of the things where you've seen this year where we've had good growth but think there's more.
That obviously could evolve over time, but I'd say based on what we know today, we think for a company with the construct of our balance sheet, risk profile, et cetera, that's probably the right range for now.
And then just finally, I know John, you talked about the pretax contribution that your actions in Citi Holdings had in the quarter, about a $1.3 billion.
So we've had about, we certainly have had the first 25 basis point increase and that's good and we're counting on that and that's performing pretty much the way that we would have expected as far as the impact on our businesses.
And then one question on balance sheet size, still things coming out of averages after the sales this quarter, the pending sales going forward.
It looks like on a year-over-year basis you were able to generate some operating leverage with revenues down a little bit less than costs.
John, you'd mentioned in the past when holdings was a much bigger portion of the overall balance sheet that maybe at around 5% of assets you would think about folding holdings back into at least the reporting of the company.
You've seen us, we talked about the overall headcount reduction which is net of significant investment into controls and we're going to continue to be mindful and to make sure that we are scaling and sizing our company to what we think the opportunities are.
And don't forget, I mean, with the investments that we're planning, our guidance is that we intend to hold the operating efficiency ratio constant with this year.
But within the submission itself, Mike, you mentioned that you like how the fourth quarter balance sheet looks, but does Costco and the additional receivables have to be contemplated as part of your submission?
I appreciate a lot of the guidance that you've given in terms of the holdings trajectory and the reduction that we're expecting on the coming year.
But then you've got on the other hand, we continually, as I said before, looking to make sure that we're running even a more risk efficient balance sheet.
Hello and welcome to Citi's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
And internationally, market sentiment clearly affected our investment sales contributing to lower overall revenues from a year ago.
We also made significant progress on DTA utilization, generating significant regulatory capital and ending the year with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% on a fully implemented basis.
Now going into the year, our goals were to generate top line growth to deliver modest positive operating leverage on our core expense base and to significantly reduce the earnings drag from legal and repositioning costs.
Card purchase sales continued to grow up 10%, but card loans were flat year-over-year in Latin America driven by higher payment rates in our Mexico cards portfolio.
Operating expenses grew 3% as higher regulatory and compliance costs, technology investments and certain one-time items were partially offset by lower legal and repositioning costs, as well as ongoing efficiency savings.
In credit cards and other retail loans, our NCL and delinquency rates remained broadly stable versus last quarter across the emerging markets.
Excluding this gain, retail banking revenues grew 4% reflecting continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads.
Finally, turning to retail services, revenues declined 1% from last year mostly reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices on both loan growth and purchase sales.
Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America declined 6% driven by lower repositioning costs and ongoing efficiency savings, as we continued to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint.
Credit was broadly stable in North America and Asia again this quarter with loss rates of 226 and 84 basis points respectively.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars driven by growth in high quality deposits and spreads.
Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion increased 6% from last year, while our equity underwriting revenues rebounded somewhat from the third quarter, they were down 18% from last year on lower overall industry activity.
In constant dollars, lending revenues declined 2% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads.
Total Markets and Security Services revenues of $3.2 billion grew 9% from last year.
And in Security Services revenues grew 2% on a reported basis and were up 12% in constant dollars reflecting increased activity and higher client balances.
Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion declined 1% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance costs as well as compensation expense were more than offset by lower repositioning costs, incremental efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation.
Total credit costs were $641 million, up from $309 million last quarter, mostly reflecting the impact of loan loss reserve builds.
Excluding the impact of these specific reserve releases, we built roughly $300 million of energy related loan loss reserves this quarter, reflecting our view that oil prices are likely to remain low for a longer period of time.
Our local markets rates and currencies business was remarkably stable and profitable franchise again in 2015 generating revenues in the range of $1 billion per quarter.
We currently expect the benefits of lower funding costs, the exit of loss making portfolios and other repositioning efforts to offset virtually all of the operating earnings previously contributed by OneMain.
The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while City Holdings has continued to shrink.

Asia accounts for 70% of our total International Consumer portfolio and we've seen loss rates under 100 basis points in Asia for the past 4 years.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Can you talk about the outlook for DTA consumption and maybe some of the levers to pull if there's continued headwinds either related to OCI or just macro environment impacts to the actual earnings?
And then just separately, you mentioned about investing in high ROA businesses and obviously spent some time going through the US credit card effort.

CITI,q1,2016,"We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses, utilized different tax assets, generated and returned capital to our shareholders and reduced our expenses while absorbing a significant repositioning charge.
Revenues of $17.6 billion declined 11% from last year, mostly driven by lower industry-wide activity in markets and investment banking, a continued wind down of Citi Holdings and the impact of FX translation.
Expenses decreased 3% year-over-year, driven by the wind down of Citi Holdings, lower legal expenses and the benefit from FX translation, partially offset by higher repositioning costs and ongoing investments in the franchise.
And net credit losses continued to improve offset by a loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release in the prior year.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 1% year-over-year to $619 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 5% to $935 billion.
In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were down 6% from last year, mostly driven by capital markets related businesses, fixed income, equities, investment banking and Asia Wealth Management as well as the impact of our continued investments in U.S. branded cards.
And Latin America consumer, which is now comprised solely of our Mexico franchise, revenues grew 2% as growth in retail banking continued to be partially offset by pressure in cards.
However, card balances remained under pressure in Mexico, as continued growth in purchase sales was offset by higher payment rates, reflecting our focus on higher credit quality segments of the market.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues decline 4% year-over-year, driven by weak investment sales revenues, as well as continued but abating regulatory pressures in cards.
And finally, total international consumer credit costs increased 7% from last year, reflecting the impact of reserve releases in the prior period.
In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 6% from last year, driven by higher acquisition and rewards costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products.
And finally, credit costs in North America increased 17% from last year, driven by a reserve build of approximately $80 million this quarter in our commercial portfolio related to energy credits.
Card revenues were still down year-over-year this quarter but we believe we can return to growth sometime in the latter part of 2016, not including the benefit of acquiring the cost Costco portfolio.
First is the impact of the current environment on market sensitive businesses including wealth management as well as mortgage, which together drove a year-over-year decline in revenues of nearly $150 million.
And weÂve achieved this growth with very little change in our core expenses, in fact year-over-year the entire increase in our consumer operating expenses was driven by the combination of investments and higher repositioning costs.
As we move forward, we believe, we are making the right investments to grow the higher return markets and products in our franchise and that as these investments mature and we cycle past the remaining regulatory headwinds, we will be well positioned to drive higher returns to something in the range of 20% RoTCE in a more normal rate environment.
Turning now to the intuitional clients group on Slide 12, revenues of $8 billion in the first quarter declined 12% from last year, driven by market sensitive businesses, fixed income, equities, and investment banking, total banking revenues of $4 billion excluding the impact of loan hedges declined 6%.
First, despite the challenging market conditions this quarter, we continued to see growth in several of our accrual and transaction services businesses including treasury and trades solutions, private banks, and security services.
To offset these pressures, we continue to actively address our structure, reducing capacity in areas where revenues are likely to remain muted, while preserving our client facing capabilities, and these actions drove much of the repositioning charge in ICG this quarter.
It does not mean that we would be immune to revenue swings in more market sensitive businesses like markets and investment banking, but our mix of traditional banking and transaction services does provide a stable, growing base of revenues in more efficient, higher return businesses where we believe revenues are likely to remain muted and weÂre taking appropriate measures to optimize our capacity without diminishing our client capabilities, and we are remaining disciplined on credit.
Our NIM should be fairly stable at this level in the second quarter as we continue to offset the impact of the wind down of Citi Holdings, with improvements in the core franchise.
Clearly, this year started with a more challenging environment than we had anticipated, resulting in lower revenues and a higher operating efficiency ratio than we had planned, even before the pull forward of certain repositioning actions into the quarter.
While the expense saves resulting from these repositioning actions will help offset some of this pressure, we still expect our full year operating efficiency ratio to be higher than we had anticipated, in the range of around 58%.
We believe investment banking revenues should recover from first quarter levels, if the environment is favorable, based on the significant backlog of deals we have pending with our clients.
On the consumer side, we continue to believe we can achieve year over year revenue growth in our existing U.S. branded cards and Asia cards businesses in the latter half of 2016.
And also, donÂt forget, we do believe that in the second half of the year, we are going to get year-over-year revenue growth coming out of the U.S. branded cards business as well as the Asia cards business, one as we see those investments begin to really kick-in on the final piece of the puzzle.
And in Asia, again, credit cards, we believe that weÂre working our way through the last of the regulatory pressure and therefore we should get growth out of that business.
But yes, IÂd say itÂs those things and then the continued growth of the accrual businesses and ICG, and the big wild card is going to be what happens with market sentiment.
So, those are elements of the path forward and then the final is as we have put out we still believe that our consumer business is capable of generating a 20% RoTCE in a normal environment and the ICG of 14% in consumer we told you and we're focused, we're focused on cards and wealth management, we think that that's the right path forward, we think that's the right way to grow revenue, we think that those are both good efficiency and a high return businesses, we've got to focus on moving more of our account acquisition to digital channels that'll really benefit the efficiency ratio as well.
7% compound annual growth rate even in the somewhat challenging environment that we've all been operating in the last two years, investment banking we feel really good about that franchise, it's a bad quarter, there wasn't much deal volume.
Yes looking at the global consumer bank, in the last couple of years you've given us guidance on positive operating leverage and maybe not on a quarterly basis but on an annual basis we saw that you delivered that in both 2014 and '15, and this year, I guess the first quarter doesn't look good and then you've got all these moving parts with Costco coming in and other jurisdictions being shutdown.
Especially with the large amount of repositioning then that we did in the first quarter, so I think it is going to hard to generate that type of story for 2016, but we do think then that again, the business that we're growing and the business that we're investing in is one that is going to be capable of generating on a consistent basis positive operating leverage and higher returns, so that's what we're trying to do Chris.
With the 180 write down that we took our remaining investment in that country is $4 million so it looks like itÂs headed for some really good ROE, if and when the business can come back.
And Costco first year we have it Costco will not be contributing much just because of the way the accounting works, but we think thatÂs a really good business and looking forward the contributions that will make in the second half of Â17 and then into Â18.
Just one question on the profitability targets, I know we spent quite a bit of time on it this morning but taking the challenging revenue by what we saw in 1Q the 100 basis point increase in the efficiency target and then the breakeven guidance for Holdings for the remainder of the year.
Well any number that I gave you is ex-Costco, and I didn't give you a view towards what consumer would be, but donÂt forget Costco overall as I think I mentioned earlier you got to think in terms of Costco's revenue expense cost of credit being basically breakeven for the balance of this year and that's just due to the fact that the way the accounting works you're forced to build loan loss reserves, basically over the first year that you have the portfolio.
Again as we continue to offset the impact of HoldingsÂ run off by a better spreads on our long business is largely due to the interest rate lift that we got, in coming out of December and by the tail-end of the year as we get the Costco of business on our books, that should be another boon to our NIM and weÂre expecting somewhere in the order of a 3 basis point improvement from Costco.
Hello and welcome to CitiÂs First Quarter 2016 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
And while U.S. branded cards showed stronger performance across key indicators, both top and bottom-line results remained lower due to the investments we are making in that business.
The first quarter is historically a strong period for wealth management in Asia with higher transaction activity driving strong investment sales revenues.
Given weak investor sentiment during the quarter, we didnÂt see the typical rebound in transaction activity and therefore our wealth management revenue declined significantly from last year.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion were roughly flat, excluding a $110 million gain on the sale of our Texas branches last year as continued growth in loans in deposit spreads was offset by lower mortgage gain on sale revenues.
Total expenses of $2.5 billion in North America increased 7%, driven by higher repositioning costs and marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings as we continue to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint.
On Slide 9, we show some key performance indicators for North America branded cards including year-over-year growth in average active accounts, average card loans, and purchase sales for our total portfolio.
Growth in average active accounts and purchase sales began to accelerate late last year and these trends are now driving total loan growth as well even as our legacy portfolios continue to shrink.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients as well as improved deposit spreads.
Total market and security services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 15% from last year.
Together, TTS, corporate lending, private bank and security services account for nearly half of total ICG revenues and they grew 7% year-over-year this quarter in constant dollars.
The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink.
So, even though we expect to incur significant additional expenses related to Costco in the second half, we believe our core operating expenses in Citicorp can remain roughly flat sequentially going into the second quarter and then decline somewhat thereafter.

Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
And then next one, I am not sure what you can say but you guys got a very, very favorable living will outcome here this week and some investors pointed the fact that youÂve highlighted a commitment to increasing capital returns in your deck upfront while certainly thatÂs not a new goal for you thinking about CCAR right around the corner.
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
So weÂve got a model in place, we set the businesses with their goals, but if market conditions look as though those revenue environments are not going to come around then weÂll need to take some additional actions hopefully as you said weÂre finished with large repositioning actions.

CITI,q2,2016,"These results are a significant improvement from the first quarter not just in the overall amount of earnings, but in the proportion generated from our core business in Citicorp relative to the assets were winding down in Citi Holdings.
In global consumer banking, we had positive operating leverage in our international franchise, highlighted by solid year-over-year growth in Mexico and continued sequential improvement in Asia.
Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, but expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $634 billion, as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 5% to $938 billion.
In constant dollars, Citicorp revenues were flat to the prior year, as growth in our institutional franchise was offset by lower consumer revenues and the absence of prior period real estate gains in Corp other.
Pre-tax earnings of $5.7 billion in Citicorp were down from last year, but improved over 25% sequentially on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and the lower cost in credit.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew sequentially, but were down 4% from last year, as continued growth in consumer and commercial banking was more than offset by lower mortgage activity.
In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 1% from last year, as a modest benefit from the Costco portfolio, which we acquired on June 17, was offset by the continued impact of higher rewards costs in our existing portfolio, as well as higher payment rates.
The impact of the renewal should lower pre-tax earnings by approximately $50 million per quarter through the end of next year, primarily due to higher expenses, including the amortization of intangibles.
Finally, turning to retail services, revenues of $1.5 billion decreased 4% from last year, reflecting the absence of two portfolios we sold in the first quarter, as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships, principally Home Depot.
We expect revenues to remain around this $1.5 billion level per quarter through the end of next year, as expected volume growth is likely to be offset by the impact of absorbing the more competitive terms in our partnership renewals.
Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America increased 5%, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, as well as continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings.
And finally, credit cards in North America increased 13% from last year, mostly reflecting a reserve building branded cards, driven by volume growth and the impact of Costco compared to a reserve release in the prior period.
In Latin America, consumer revenues were up 4%, as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 7% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards.
Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in the third quarter of last year, we expect this positive operating leverage to continue in the second-half of 2016.
While wealth management revenues were down year-over-year, we did see sequential growth in both revenues and AUM inflows during the quarter, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs, driven by the impact of lower equity market values.
We also saw improvements in card revenues, which were flat to last year, and we continue to believe, we are on track to deliver year-over-year growth in the second-half of 2016.
However, we expect these revenues to stabilize in the second-half of the year with continued growth in higher return personal loans, and therefore, an improvement in the overall yield of the portfolio.
In total, we expect Asia consumer revenues to return to growth in the second-half of 2016, resulting in positive operating leverage year-over-year.
On Slide 8, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans, and revenues.
But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show solid progress in our existing franchise, with organic growth in purchase sales and average loans of 10% and 3%, respectively, and improving year-over-year revenue trend, which we expect to turn positive in the fourth quarter of 2016.
As you can see, the continued impact of our cards initiatives on revenues as well, which should abate as we go into the second-half of the year.
Our expense growth in the first-half was predominantly driven by investments across our franchise, as well as higher repositioning charges in the first quarter, and credit headwinds reflect the absence of prior period reserve releases.
Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 11, revenues of $8.8 billion in the second quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by fixed income and treasury and trade solutions.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients.
Investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 6% from last year, mostly on lower industry-wide equity underwriting activity, but showed a significant improvement from the prior quarter, reflecting a rebound in both market conditions, as well as our wallet share in all major products.
Private bank revenues of $738 million were down 1% year-over-year on lower managed investments and capital markets activity.
The cost of credit related to energy was minimal, as net credit losses were mostly offset by previously existing reserves and the portfolio benefited from the stabilization in oil prices, as well as increased capital markets activity.
Given our target client focus on high-quality corporate credits, certain energy clients were able to access the capital markets as the market environment became more favorable in the second quarter.
Looking forward, we remain cautious and the environment is uncertain, but we could see total ICG cost of credit in the back-half of the year in the range of $300 million to $500 million.
And with the strong second quarter performance in markets, we are now flat to last year in fixed income and equities, but remain down year-over-year in investment banking, given lower overall market activity.
Looking to the second-half of the year, NIM should recover to around 290 basis points or slightly higher, driven by a 3 basis point improvement from Costco, as well as the normalization of average cash balances.
In consumer banking, revenues in North America should grow sequentially, driven by branded cards, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition, which should generate incremental revenues of roughly $200 million over the second quarter.
International consumer revenues should grow modestly from the second quarter, resulting in year-over-year improvement in both Asia and Mexico, excluding the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business last year.
Turning to the institutional business, we expect market revenues to reflect the normal seasonal decline from the second quarter, while investment banking revenues should be largely stable, assuming that market conditions remain favorable.
Core expenses in Citicorp should be slightly down from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of repositioning savings, partially offset by higher expenses related to Costco and other branded cards investments.
And credit costs in Citicorp should be somewhat higher than the second quarter, mostly driven by reserve builds for volume growth and the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition.
The business that weÂre building in branded cards is one that is set to yield in ROA of 225 to 235 basis points, where we were going into the crisis and with a better more higher quality book of business.
But at the same point in time, because the capital markets remained open during the month of June, we did benefit from a lot of our energy clients then being able to access the client, so that produced a much lower cost of credit than I think Mike had probably indicated when he spoke at the conference at the early part of June.
And with the renewals that weÂve done and with the new partnership with Costco, I think that speaks to the type of clients that weÂre really looking to build on.
So I donÂt think that this is more than a one or two quarter blip down in purchase sale growth in Asia.
ItÂs consumer where we had a bit of a slowdown in that momentum, which weÂre now working our way out of, which is why we find getting 4% year-over-year revenue growth to be a nice start positive operating leverage this quarter, positive operating leverage in the back-half of this year.
So, again, if we can execute on the things that we want to execute, create the earnings, continue to liberate the DTA, weÂre going to have a lot of firepower against the stock, and IÂd like to keep investing and making sure, weÂre finding and continuing to build on growth.
And I was just wondering is the prior comments you had made about 58% in Corp for the year still relevant, given the trends that weÂve seen, or is there anything that kind of coming out of the second quarter with the 57 that makes you feel any better about the second-half, I know thereÂs some seasonality?
One last or one for me just in terms your NIM comments and then just that we know that Costco is going to full quarter in the third, itÂs a pretty good line of sight in terms of being able to grow NII from here?
But, yes, we feel very good about the NII, and thatÂs why we feel that the NIM should improve back up to the 290 or maybe a little higher range in the second-half of the year.
And I recognize, John, that you donÂt want to give explicit guidance on balance sheet growth expectations, but with the price of RWAs come down in the quarter and given the growth in both loans and assets, IÂm just trying to get a better handle as to what was driving that.
So youÂre likely to see still weÂll have investment spending in Mexico, but that is captured in the guidance that I gave you as far as our belief of generating positive operating leverage in the second-half of this year and positive operating leverage in consumer in 2017, so thatÂs embedded in that.
But I think the spirit of Mike and I are trying to answer your questions, we donÂt see any large lumpy dollar where weÂre going to tell you that this is going to be some negative impact on our financial performance for the next several quarters.
And I think as Mike said, weÂre obviously been able to do that in billion dollars of utilization over the last couple of years.
But probably sometime over this summer or as we get to the end of the third quarter, weÂll probably come out with some talk about when weÂre going to go up more broadly.
Hello and welcome to CitiÂs Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Good morning and thank you all for joining us.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that todayÂs presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on managementÂs current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
I think weÂve navigated the most recent volatility very well as a result of our strategic client segmentation and strong risk management.
John will now go through the presentation and then weÂd be happy to answer your questions.
Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise and net credit losses declined 5% year-over-year.
Turning now to each business, Slide 5 shows the results from North America consumer banking.
And we remain open to inorganic growth through new programs and acquisition opportunities, given the right strategic fit and return profile.
These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 10%, respectively.
Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region.
The NCL rates in Latin America showed particular improvement this quarter, reflecting seasonal payment trend.
Underlying credit quality has remained stable with the net loss rate declining year-over-year.
We continue to capture market share and saw strong momentum across payment products, such as U.S. dollar clearing, as well as commercial cards, where purchase sales grew 9% year-over-year.
Total markets and security services revenues of $4.7 billion grew 10% from last year.
Total net credit losses were $141 million, with roughly two-thirds offset by related reserve releases.
The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
The funded loan book at the first quarter was 63% investment grade, thatÂs actually improved now to 65%.
And because weÂre concentrated in those high-quality names, they do have access to capital markets and therefore are able to strengthen their balance sheets.
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
I just like Â just want to make sure weÂre growing profitability here and not just volume, important business for you guys?
So, what youÂve seen through the crisis is a Â an impact on ROA first with a severe downturn in ROA, as everybody built reserves and worked their way through the credit issues and then coming out now weÂve all benefited from reserve releases.
But that did since we now are settled for a couple of quarters youÂre going to see the preferred dividend than increase over where they were prior year.
And IÂm wondering if there are limitations on growth or balance sheet allocation that weÂre not thinking about.
And is keeping your surcharge where it is today a bigger priority than potentially growing the balance sheet in a greater way to gain market share, given how volatile that that score can be?
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
It sounds like what youÂre pointing us towards is balance sheet expansion driving NII growth with perhaps a little bit of a lift also from NIM, continued positive operating leverage from lower repositioning costs and some improvement in the provision guidance, although still incremental build, but potentially some lesser degree of trading revenue.
Balance sheet expansion is not really something that weÂre targeting.
IÂm not prepared to give forward guidance on the balance sheet.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
So thereÂs still obviously the execution to do, but it seems like the heavy lifting has been done from an investment point of view.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Looking really at this CCAR cycle, youÂve obviously had some good news in terms of living will, your CCAR proposal was accepted without any change.
Obviously, weÂre still working through the $11 billion portfolio that we have a 11 million new card members, letÂs give them a delightful experience first and then weÂll think about international.
So I would say the pipeline for the third quarter remains pretty strong and provided we get reasonable markets.
And then just finally, your Â obviously your credit quality has improved dramatically and itÂs still very strong.

CITI,q3,2016,"Hello, and welcome to Citi's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Good morning and thank you all for joining us.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
The remainder of our branded cards portfolio as well as retail services also delivered modest revenue growth as did our more focused retail branch network.
Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise, with stable to improving loss rates in every region.
Slide five shows the results for North America Consumer Banking.
These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 12% respectively.
Wealth Management revenues grew 11% from last year on improving investor sentiment and continued positive AUM inflows.
Retail lending revenues remained under pressure as we continued to shift our portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans this quarter.
Slide eight shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail across both cards and retail banking.
Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter in every region.
And Wealth Management revenues continue to recover with improving investor sentiment.
The TTS business remains core to our institutional strategy, delivering integrated solutions to our multinational clients and deepening our operating relationships with them across multiple products and markets.
And Corporate Lending revenues of $450 million also grew 4%, mostly reflecting higher average loans.
While these positions provide an economic hedge and help us manage concentrations to any particular client, sector or region, they are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis.
The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink.
And Investment Banking revenue should be broadly stable sequentially, assuming that market conditions remain favorable.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
I think you've seen a relatively strong calendar on the debt issuance side, which always helps fuel secondary activity, and I think people are now focusing on positioning or repositioning their credit portfolios for an environment in the U.S. of higher rates.
Yes. If you look at the world next year, growth rates globally coming up a bit with probably parts of the emerging markets rebounding better or faster than parts of the developed economies.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
And we thought an additional 3 basis point improvement by normalizing average cash balances.
Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
In our Global Consumer Bank, we saw revenue increases in every business line and geography, excluding the impact of a one-time gain last year in Mexico.
And the backbone of our global network, Treasury and Trade Solutions, generated year-over-year revenue growth for the 11th consecutive quarter despite the low rate environment.
Revenues of $17.8 billion declined 4% from last year, and expenses decreased 2%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well as the impact of foreign exchange translations.
And credit costs improved, reflecting a reduction in the provision for benefits and claims due to asset sales in Citi Holdings as well as lower net credit losses, partially offset by a net reserve build this quarter as compared to a small release in the prior year.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $638 billion and 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 4% to $940 billion.
However, this comparison includes losses on mark-to-market loan hedges this quarter as compared to gains in the prior year as well as certain previously disclosed one-time items that benefited the third quarter of 2015, including a gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico and the reversal of valuation adjustment in our equities business.
Citicorp expenses grew 3%, mostly reflecting volume growth as well as continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings.
Most of the reserve build related to our U.S. Cards franchise, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections, which I'll describe more in a moment.
Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion grew 2% from last year on continued growth in average loans and checking deposits of 9% and 10%, respectively.
We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core six markets, enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank.
And now with the right footprint and infrastructure in place, we are beginning to invest for additional growth by enhancing our segmentation strategy focused on the Citigold wealth management platform, improving our digital and mobile banking capabilities and continuing to upgrade the network with smart branches and dedicated Citigold centers.
Revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15%, reflecting the first full quarter of contribution from the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth.
Excluding Costco, we generated 1% underlying revenue growth as we are beginning to lap the investment program we started last year and a portion of the new balances are maturing to full rate.
Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.6 billion, up 12% from last year, mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and continued marketing investments.
In branded cards, the NCL rate declined to 225 basis points this quarter, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio, which did not incur any losses during the quarter as we had generally excluded late-stage delinquencies from the acquired loans.
Excluding Costco, the NCL rate in branded cards has been in the range of roughly 280 basis points year-to-date.
We expect the loss rate on Costco to be lower than the existing portfolio, but this benefit will likely be offset by the impact of seasoning as well as the estimated impact of the proposed regulatory guidelines I just mentioned.
In retail services, the loss rate has been in the range of around 410 basis points year-to-date, and we expect it to increase to around 435 basis points next year, again, primarily reflecting the impact of seasoning and the proposed regulatory guidelines.
In total, excluding the impact of a one-time gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico last year, revenues grew 4% and expenses were flat to last year.
In Latin America, excluding the prior year gain, consumer revenues were up 5% as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 11% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards.
As Mike mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in our Mexico consumer franchise to drive sustainable growth, with initiatives to enhance our branch network, digital capabilities and service offerings.
We expect to maintain positive operating leverage next quarter and each year throughout the investment period, driven by revenue growth as well as cost savings from upgrading and standardizing our technology platforms.
Consumer revenues grew 3% year-over-year, driven by improvement in Wealth Management and cards, partially offset by the continued repositioning of our retail loan portfolio.
And cards turned positive as well with revenues up 4%, driven by modest volume growth, a continued improvement in yields and abating regulatory headwinds.
And finally, total credit costs grew 13% in our international consumer franchise, reflecting a modest reserve build this quarter compared to our release in the prior year, while loss rates remained favorable.
But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show progress in our existing franchise with organic growth in purchase sales, average loans and revenues this quarter.
As I just noted, in Asia, we have also achieved revenue growth year-over-year, which we expect to continue going forward.
And finally, in Latin America, we achieved growth in both purchase sales and average loans this quarter, but revenues remained down 6% versus last year.
On a comparable basis, card revenues in Latin America would have been down 3% versus last year, reflecting the continued impact of higher payment rates.
With continued growth in purchase sales and average loans, we expect Latin America card revenues to return to sustainable growth in the second half of next year.
The decline in the NCL rate in North America mostly reflects the impact of the Costco portfolio, which, as I mentioned earlier, did not incur any losses this quarter.
However, as our loan portfolio continues to grow in season, we still expect this NCL rate to run closer to 4.5% as we go into next year.
When we presented this slide last quarter, our first half EBIT comparison was affected by several factors, including the comparison to much stronger prior year periods in wealth management, the early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of this year.
We are beginning to lap the impact of our branded cards investments on rebate and rewards costs and saw a full-quarter benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio.
Revenues of $8.6 billion in the third quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by Fixed Income, Investment Banking and Treasury and Trade Solutions.
Private Bank revenues of $746 million were up 4% year-over-year, driven by loan growth, improved spreads and higher managed investment revenues.
Finally, in Securities Services, revenues grew 4% year-over-year as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads more than offset the impact of divestitures.
Given the strong revenue performance this quarter, we're now showing 2% growth on a year-to-date basis in our accrual and transaction services businesses as well as markets and banking.
The most significant year-over-year drag comes from other revenue items, including the impact of the Venezuela devaluation in the first quarter as well as mark-to-mark losses on loan hedges, driven by spread movements.
Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our previous outlook of around 290 basis points as the benefit from Costco and other loan growth was offset by lower trading NIM and higher-than-anticipated cash balances during the quarter as we supported client activity.
In consumer, we expect to continue to generate year-over-year revenue growth in constant dollars across North America, Asia and Latin America, although, sequentially, mortgage activity could be seasonally slower versus the third quarter.
In the institutional franchise, we expect markets to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter, but revenues still should improve year-over-year.
However, we also expect NCLs to be higher as the Costco portfolio begins to incur losses and we continue to see the impact of volume growth.
I think you showed a lot of progress in turning around growth in both international consumer and cards, keeping expenses flat, credits fine, shrinking the share count, all the good stuff.
The results that we're getting on those loan hedges, the large gain in last third quarter and the heavier losses now that we've taken in the second and the third quarter, I think that's more reflective of a wider spread, larger spread movement, then this is the way it's always going to be.
And Glenn, on the spread products side of things, I think what you've seen here is the years progressed and we moved more towards a more likely shift towards higher rates.
And now it's really supporting and driving growth, and a lot of what you've seen is now turning toward is the increase in terms of marketing and really trying to drive volume towards and client acquisition towards those cards.
And that's our goal, is to continue to increase that capital return, as I think Mike said in his opening remarks.
So there's a few things that, I think, Mike and I would like to be able to work our way through before we gave you a specific answer on that question.
This year, given the first quarter revenues, where they were, it's likely to be a little bit higher, maybe 225.
Again, I don't want to say that we're going to stay in that 200 to 225 range next year, but I certainly don't see it growing to 500 basis points, Jim. I think I was doing it as a percentage of expenses.
We feel that the investments that we've talked about in the investment -- in the equities business are largely done and primarily focused on really two key areas, one is an investment in terms of technology, which is critical, certainly to the future of the equities business and second, it's coming out of a resizing, rescaling that we've gone through in our equities business of making sure we've got the right people in the right positions and being out there and getting talent, both internally and externally, into the right seats.
And then on a going-forward basis, the way we're looking at it right now, even with the investment spend that we want to do, we do believe that we'll be able to generate positive operating leverage in our Mexico consumer business in the next couple of years.
We don't see -- again, we think that rates may inch up a little bit next year, but again, we're not seeing anything that would suggest some change in the cycle at this point in time.
And just like with everything else with the Costco portfolio, I think we'll know more and be able to give you a better sense as to sustained run rates of growth, et cetera, over the course of the next two to three quarters.
But again, I think, on a year-to-date basis, we're doing okay and we're in line with where we said we were going to be.

CITI,q4,2016,"Hello, and welcome to Citi's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Citigroup credit costs improved significantly driven by improvement in both ICG and Citi Holdings, partially offset by higher credit costs in consumer reflecting the loan growth as well as the shift from reserve releases last year to reserve builds in North America cards.
Excluding these items, Citicorp revenue increased 3% year-over-year in constant dollars or over $1.7 billion driven by growth in fixed income markets, Treasury and Trade Solutions, North America Card, and Mexico Consumer revenues.
And our operating margin grew by nearly $400 million including the impact of significant investments in our North America cards franchise that have not yet fully matured.
Turning now to each business, Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer banking.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 4% from last year reflecting lower mortgage revenues as well as the impact of certain consumer incentives offered in coordination with the launch of our enhanced retail segmentation strategy.
Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.5 billion, up 6% from last year mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth, and continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings.
In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 8% driven by continued momentum in retail banking with average loans and deposits increasing 7% and 13% respectively.
Credit trends in Asia consumer remains stable this quarter and the NCL rate in Latin America remained favorable at 415 basis points.
While we continue to believe the NCL rate in Latin America should settle closer to 4.5% as the portfolio seasons, it will likely remain below this level for the first half of 2017, reflecting strong credit quality and continued loan delinquency rates.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.1 billion grew 6% in constant dollars driven by continued momentum with new and existing clients.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were flat to last year and higher debt underwriting revenues offset declines in equity underwriting and M&A.
We feel good about the strength of our franchises in fixed income and Investment Banking where clients remain engaged and our results will reflect overall market environment.
Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
I think if you look at the business coming out of the fourth quarter and the momentum we're carrying you could tail that I would choose to split one as I look at our institutional businesses and whether it's rates and currency spread product TTS, Private Bank check them off.
Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet.
Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
And second question is one of your primary competitors mentioned late last year that we could be seeing the bottom in global fixed income pools and you mentioned that the current run rate for fixed income is about 35% from peak although saying that, half of that is permanently gone and IÂm wondering if you contemplate your franchise, do you agree with those numbers in terms of what the potential structural upside could be from here?
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.
Our next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Our final question will come from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet.
In Global Consumer, our U.S. branded cards business continues to see the early benefits from the Costco portfolio and our other cards products also delivered revenue growth.
Revenues of $17 billion in the fourth quarter declined 9% from the prior year and expenses decreased 9% as well each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $624 billion as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 4% to $929 billion.
Pre-tax earnings of $5.1 billion in Citicorp grew by over $1.3 billion year-over-year mostly driven by higher revenues and lower credit costs in our institutional franchise.
We earned a small pre-tax profit in the fourth quarter with revenues, expenses, and cost of credit each declining significantly as we continue to wind down the portfolio.
Turning to branded cards, revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15% reflecting the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition as well as modest organic growth.
To-date, we have generated over 1 million new Costco card accounts and over $52 billion of purchase sales and loans continue to grow in the fourth quarter ending the year at nearly $17 billion.
Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.6 billion were roughly flat to last year as loan growth offset the absence of two portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships.
Net credit losses increased to $1.1 billion mostly driven by Costco, organic volume growth and seasoning, and the impact of regulatory changes on collections and cards and we've built a $113 million of net loan loss reserves during the quarter compared to a release in the prior year driven by the ongoing impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition as well as organic volume growth.
Net income grew significantly from last year on higher revenues, lower operating expenses and stable cost of credit.
Over the past year we have increased net interest revenue as a percentage of average loans in the retail portfolio by 13 basis points, largely offsetting the revenue impact from a 7% decline in average loans driven by mortgages and the runoff of certain non-core products.
We also expect to generate loan growth in cards going forward as we invest to drive higher account acquisition and usage.
The early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio, and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of the year.
Net income of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter grew substantially from last year on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and lower cost of credit.
Citicorp net interest revenues grew 4% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full-year in constant dollars, driven by loan growth as well as the net impact of higher short-term rates.
Looking forward, we believe Citicorp net interest revenue will continue to grow in 2017 with a roughly $500 million impact from the December 2016 rate hike and a $900 million benefit from loan growth and mix including the impact of our card investments maturing in the second half of 2017.
Turning to NIM, our net interest margin of 279 basis points in the fourth quarter declined by roughly 7 basis points sequentially, driven mostly by lower trading NIM, higher funding costs, and the higher mix of promotional rate balances in cards.
And looking to next year, we expect the net interest margin to remain roughly flat to the full-year of 286 basis points as improvement in the core franchise offsets the continued decline in the Legacy Holdings portfolio.
We ended 2016 with a far more favorable backdrop than we started the year, in terms of client engagement, capital markets activity, and commodity prices and we expect the environment to remain broadly favorable going forward.
At a high level, we expect to deliver modest revenue growth and an improved efficiency ratio for total Citigroup, even as we continue to invest in the franchise and wind down the non-core assets that will now be reported in Corp/Other.
In consumer, we expect continued revenue growth and positive operating leverage on a full-year basis in constant dollars in both Asia and Mexico even as we execute on our investment plans for each region.
In the second half we expect growth to be driven organically as our branded cards investments mature and more loans begin to accrue at full rate.
As Mike described earlier, we believe we're on the right path to improve our return on tangible common equity excluding the capital supporting disallowed DTA from 9% in 2016 to at least 10% in 2018 and we should demonstrate progress towards that goal this year as we continue to drive efficiencies across the franchise and begin to see the full benefit of our cards investments in the second half of the year.
I think if you look from a North America perspective, the investments that we made in terms of getting Costco up and going and John talked to the numbers there, $6 billion of loan growth there, $52 billion of purchase sales in the six months and million new customers.
And so by the second half of next year, we should see that really starting to kick in and from the branded cards perspective, again we started those investments and we've seen the revenue growth, we've seen kind of all the positive indicators there but we know that's just a bit of a longer story but the investments we're making in digital and those things across the board feel like we're well-positioned.
There is a very, very small impact of higher rates that we've got baked into 2018 but it's a half-year of a 25 basis point increase so it doesn't really drive a lot.
If you do have this improving efficiency ratio out there it does presume also that you talked about the card loss expectations for this year, but just a broader question on credit in general how much normalization, do you expect, are you anticipating seeing not just from credit from card, but just as the portfolio continues to season with other recent growth that you've seen across the -- across the globe?
Credit costs in our forward look inch up a bit from the 2018 as portfolio season and we have to think that the environment becomes a little weak, but again weÂre not looking, we don't anticipate a significant growth in that credit by 2018, 2019 may be branded cards ticks up somewhat above 300 basis points but it's still well within I think what you would expect a good branded performance to be.
John just wanted to clarify, the outlook for the net interest income dollars that you gave it sounded like may be looking at a net growth of about $1.2 billion in 2017 did I get that right and would that be assuming no more rate hikes?
We made a commitment to use DTA, I remember four, five years ago, some people writing that not only would we never use it, we never stop creating it, and we have and so listen it's progress, it's not as fast as we'd like to go, the environment is not as good as we'd like to have it, it's not an excuse but I think in terms of the things that we've laid out there, we have executed against each of them in this environment, in a disciplined and committed way and that's what we're going to continue to do.
We think that's an important milestone target you to look at obviously Mike we're still, I mean we still believe that this franchise can generate an overall ROTCE up 14%.
And I think Mike was pretty clear on 2018, which is in ROTCE again excluding the DTA capital but it's progress of 10% and during 2017, the expectation is that you're going to see meaningful progress towards that goal.
We continue to wind down holdings and as Mike said, we're going to be increasing the amount of capital that we return each year to our shareholders.
But again, we believe that the investments that we've made and are continuing to make our branded cards franchise as Mike mentioned in Mexico and in Asia that's going to help us significantly close this gap and we expect to show you continuous improvement in GCB's ROTCE each year from this point forward.
And a quick question on the margin guidance you're getting with the 286 for 2017 is the right way to think about that as maybe just in the first quarter of 2017 that the increased investment spend, maybe takes away some of the benefits from the increased in rates in December I guess and I'm trying to get the trajectory over 2017 to understand where and 2017 as a good starting point for 2018.
John, you've alluded to this in over the last 90 minutes but I guess I'm, I just want to get a specific comment from you in terms of, it looks like the capital returns this year of the $12.2 billion you mentioned were roughly little over 80% of your net income and you've clearly set out a path in terms of return on tangible common equity can you give us a little greater level of detail in 2017 and 2018.
We think about it and we speak about it as to John's point there is -- probably really three components to our capital generation there is our earnings, there is our DTA utilization, there is holdings runoff.
And then just finally, John, you mentioned that the Citi Holdings revenues in 2017 should be about half of last year which would be about $1 billion.
",44.11,0.80061764
CITI,q1,2017,"We grew loans and deposits, and achieved an efficiency ratio of just under 58%, a return on assets of 91 basis points and a return on tangible common equity, ex-DTA, of over 10%, in line with our near term targets which were committed to meeting.
Global consumer banking, our U.S. credit card business continued to benefit from the Costco portfolio, although we did see lower mortgage revenues.
Internationally, we again posted revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Asia and Mexico, and we continued our investment plan in Mexico to drive improved efficiency and returns.
Net income grew 17% to $4.1 billion in the first quarter, driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit.
Revenues of $18.1 billion grew 3% from the prior year, reflecting growth in both our consumer and institutional businesses, offset by lower revenues and Corporate/Other, as we continued wind down legacy assets.
And cost of credit decline significantly, driven by a $230 million reserve release this quarter in ICG, as compared to a build in the prior year related to the energy sector.
Consumer cost and credit increased year-over-year, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio and other volume growth, as well as the continued impact of changes in collection processes in U.S. cards.
Mortgage revenues declined by roughly $80 million year-over-year, reflecting lower origination activity and higher cost of funds, as well as the impact of the previously announced sale of a portion of our mortgage servicing rights.
Turning to branded cards, revenues of $2.1 billion grew 13%, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition and modest organic growth, offset by the impact of day count.
Looking at the total portfolio, despite the normal pay down you would expect in the first quarter, our full rate revolving balances remained stable sequentially.
And we continued to expect growth in these full rate revolving loans in the second half of the year as our investments mature.
From here, we expect yields to improve, driven by rate increases as well as the growth in full rate revolving balances in the second half of the year.
Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.6 billion were down 5%, driven mostly by the absence of gains on the sale of two small portfolios in the first quarter of last year.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were $2.6 billion, up 3% from last year, mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth, and continued investments, partially offset by efficiency savings and lower repositioning cost.
Net credit losses increased to $1.2 billion, mostly driven by Costco organic volume growth and seasoning, as well as the impact of changes in collection processes and cards.
But given normal seasonal improvement in delinquencies, we continue to expect the full year NCL rate to be around 435 basis points.
In Latin America, total consumer revenue grew 4%, driven by an 8% growth in retail banking, reflecting continued growth in average loans and deposits, as well as improved deposit spread.
However, card revenue declined from last year, reflecting lower revolving loans, as well as a higher cost to fund non-revolving balances.
The NCL rate in North America increased from last quarter, as I described earlier, but should trend lower for the remainder of the year as the Costco conversion related losses are now behind us and we should benefit from normal seasonality.
Credit trends in Asia consumer remained stable this quarter and the NCL rate in Latin America was 4.4%, up somewhat from the prior quarter, mostly driven by lower loan growth but still in line with our near term outlook.
Net income of $3 billion grew substantially from last year on higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 39% from last year, reflecting a rebound in debt and equity underwriting and our continued momentum in M&A.
As you can see, total net interest revenue declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars to $10.9 billion, as growth in core accrual revenues was more than offset by the wind down of legacy assets as well as lower trading related net interest revenue.
Turning to our Core Accrual businesses, net interest revenues of $9.5 billion were up 3% or $280 million from last year, driven by the addition of the Costco portfolio, other volume growth, and the impact of the December 2016 rate hike, partially offset by lower day count and increase in our FDIC assessment and higher long term debt.
On a sequential basis, Core Accrual revenues decline as the benefit of higher interest rates was more than offset by the impact of lower day count, loan mix and rate positioning actions.
Starting in consumer, in North America, revenue growth this quarter should continue to be mostly inorganic, driven by a full quarter of revenue contribution from the Costco portfolio which we acquired in June of last year.
And internationally, we continue to expect modest year-over-year revenue growth in constant dollars with positive operating leverage in both Asia and Mexico.
And we like to investment we said that weÂve made in both the people and the platforms in equities; we've got balance sheet to put to work; we think that we've been gaining share with our targeted clients; and I think youÂre starting to see some of that activity coming through now, it's one quarter.
You should be able to see it, both in revenue growth and also improved cost of credit, especially as we lap some of the very high cost of credit numbers that we had in the second half of last year as we were building up loan loss reserves for Costco, in connection with the purchase accounting, so those factors.
And again as I said in my opening remarks, youÂll look at what weÂve done here in terms of capital return and yet our ratios continue to go up; and so this quarter generating $5.5 billion of regulatory capital.
And again, I think our story is one where weÂve talked about, you can map out what looks like a, at this point, a fairly typical sequential ICG year; again with good momentum, and as we see things right now; and then, obviously, talking about the back half story in terms of consumer.
Yes, I want to make sure, I didn't say it was over, I said that the regulatory headwinds were abating which they had and that's actually been what you've seen in the numbers now over the last couple of quarters, as we continue to have nice yield, modest year-over-year revenue growth, 3% this quarter.
And then on the credit quality, in the branded card, I think you mentioned Costco collections changes the collection process, seasoning what not, influencing the numbers this quarter.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
While our results were impacted by one-time gains, we increased revenues in both our consumer and institutional lines of business, while maintaining our expense discipline.
Our Markets business performed very well with revenue up 17% year-over-year, comprised of 19% increase in fixed income and 10% increase in equities, another area weÂve been investing in.
Expenses were roughly flat as the impact of higher performance related compensation and higher business volumes, was offset by lower repositioning cost.
As previously announced, our result this quarter included a charge of nearly $400 million related to the exit of our U.S. mortgage servicing operations.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $629 billion as 5% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
Turning now to each business, slide four shows the results for North America Consumer Banking.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 3% from last year, driven by lower mortgage revenues.
Excluding mortgage, Retail Banking revenues were up 5%, driven by continued growth in average loans deposits and assets under management.
Net income grew 12% from last year on higher revenue and slightly lower operating expenses partially offset by higher cost on credit.
Card revenues grew 6%, driven by higher volumes and improved revolve rates versus last year.
Treasury and Trade Solution revenues of $2.1 billion grew 9%, driven by strong fee growth, higher volumes and improved spreads.
Private Bank revenues of $744 million grew 9% year-over-year, mostly driven by loan and deposit growth and improved spreads.
And Corporate Lending revenues of $434 million were down 3% from last year on lower average volumes.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.8 billion grew 18% from last year.
Assuming one additional rate hike mid-year, Core Accrual revenues should grow year-over-year by roughly $1.5 billion in total over the next three quarters, with just under two thirds of that amount coming from higher rates and the reminder mostly reflecting higher loan volumes and mix.
However, this will likely be offset by lower mortgage revenues versus the prior year.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Very rough math, John, 25 basis points rate hike should impact revenues positively by about $100 million for each full quarter that it's in effect.
What I said during the prepared remarks was that we expect the Core Accrual interest revenue to grow year-over-year by about $1.5 billion during the next three quarters, again assuming one more rate hike somewhere around midyear.
Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Now the prior guidance that we had given of $1.2 billion had included trading related net revenue.

CITI,q2,2017,"During the quarter, we saw continued momentum in our businesses with loan and revenue growth across both sides of our house.
In global consumer banking, our US retail bank showed significant growth outside of mortgage operations and we saw a 10% revenue growth in branded cards driven by the Costco portfolio.
Revenues of $17.9 billion grew 2% from the prior year reflecting 5% growth in our consumer and institutional businesses offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other as we continue to wind down legacy assets.
Expenses were up slightly as higher volume related expenses, performance based compensation, and ongoing investments were largely offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, and cost of credit increased, mostly driven by lower reserve releases versus the prior year as well as higher volumes and NCL rates in consumer.
Looking at the first half of 2017, total revenues grew 3% year over year including 7% growth in our consumer and institutional businesses.
Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year over year to $645 billion as 4% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
On a sequential basis, we saw particular strength in loan growth this quarter with an increase of $16 billion in our core businesses that was broad-based across regions and products.
Mortgage revenues declined by roughly $90 million year over year reflecting lower origination activity and higher cost of funds as well as the impact of the previously announced sale of a portion of our mortgage servicing rights.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues were up 7%, driven by continued growth in average loans, deposits, and assets under management as well as a benefit from higher interest rates.
Turning to branded cards, revenues of 2.1 billion grew 10% reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition as well as modest organic growth in our core portfolios, partially offset by the continued runoff of non-core portfolios.
Average full rate balances were stable quarter over quarter and we continue to expect growth in these full rate revolving loans with the resulting improvement in yields in the second half of the year as our investments mature.
Net credit losses increased to 1.2 billion, driven by the Costco portfolio, organic volume growth, and seasoning as well as the impact of collections activity in retail services.
And we continue to expect NCL rates to be seasonally lower in the second half of the year, consistent with the trend we saw in the month of June.
In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 8% driven by a 12% increase in retail banking reflecting continued growth in average loans and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads.
And while retail lending revenue declined versus last year, we saw sequential growth in both revenues and average loans this quarter driven by personal loans.
Total international credit cost grew by $70 million year over year, mostly reflecting reserve builds in the current quarter to support volume growth in Latin America as compared to a net release in the prior year.
Private bank revenues of 788 million, grew 17% year over year, mostly driven by loan and deposit growth, improved spreads and increased investment activity.
Core accrual net interest revenue of 10 billion was up 7% or over $600 million from last year driven by the addition of the Cosco portfolio, organic volume growth, and the impact of rate increases, partially offset by an increase in our FDIC assessment and higher long-term debt.
On a sequential basis, core accrual revenue grew by over $200 million this quarter reflecting day count, the impact of the March rate increase and loan growth.
Starting with consumer, in North America, our investments in retail banking are delivering results with revenues excluding mortgage growing by 6% year over year in the first half.
Retail services revenues continue to outperform our original outlook for a run rate of $1.5 billion per quarter this year, driven by higher than anticipated loan growth.
In Asia, we generated year over year revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the fourth straight quarter, driven by strength in cards and wealth management.
And in Mexico, we also generated revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the fifth straight quarter reflecting momentum in retail banking.
As we look to the third quarter in North America consumer, we expect continued year over year revenue growth in retail banking excluding mortgage as well as modest organic growth in cards as we grow full rate balances.
And turning to the institutional side, we expect continued year over year revenue growth in our accrual businesses, including PPS, security services, and the private bank.
And then John has set up our expectations for the second half and feel the combination of the levers we have, John, between some revenue growth, between continued expense discipline, and a reasonable environment around cost of credit and obviously meaningful capital return gives us the pathway to hitting those.
So that's going to be one of the critical drivers, and we'll take you through those details on Investor Day. We'll look forward to that and then maybe one just quickie on the quarter here John, it looks like for the first half of the year, the DTA utilization has been about 900 million for the first half, a little bit more in the first quarter than the second.
but again, 8% growth - revenue growth coming out of Mexico in a country that's growing sub 2, again, I think illustrating what we've talked about that we believe over the intermediate longer term, we've got the ability to grow our international front franchises at or in many cases at multiples the pace of domestic growth rates, and the other piece if you look in there is that in Mexico, it's the combination of our retail business in Asia, it is wealth management.
And that's a combination of things, as Mike said, its good engagement with the clients, youÂre seeing the results of a lot of the repositioning actions that we've been taking and as we reposition portfolios, we started to focus on different types of lending.
So we you know we are assuming that as rate increases occur and as the Fed does wind down its balance, we will see betas increase slightly in our corporate side business, but we do not have anything major put into the outlook for the second half of this year.
And my second question and I expect that maybe some of this would be deferred to your Investor Day, but given how much capital that you generate, even if we assume that you can continue to increase your payout from here, you clearly are still well over where you think a normal level of capital would be that's appropriate for your business.
But again, we continue to expect to see good growth rates in no particular order in terms of our TTS businesses, what we're doing in the private bank across our retail franchises, around the globe again with an emphasis on things we're doing here in the US and we're going to talk about that quite a bit in terms of Investor Day, the cards investments we've made.
If you take a look, as I mentioned, our loans are growing nicely in that business right now and we're still seeing very good customer engagement with our retail partner cards.
It does feel to us like the 150 basis points of cushion that you are assuming within your 11.5% target is very conservative and I recognize that it's going to be a multi-year process for you to take your 13% today and bring that down to 11.5% over time, but has your thinking changed or evolved at all with regards to your capital targets?
You guys showed your pretty good loan growth and -- but yet, you did mention that loan yields were down a little bit and you had some mix as far as the NIM is concerned, but I'm just wondering can you help us distill whether the [indiscernible] loan yields was related to the ongoing corporate other runoff and/or is there just a different mix in terms of, it looks like it's card that's growing the most.
So when we look at the decline in FIC revenues, again, year-over-year, in the second quarter, it's really, the lion's share of it is being driven by G10 FX is reflecting a low volatility that I think everyone has spoken about in the market.
Hello, and welcome to Citi's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Internationally, we had continued revenue growth in both regions; Latin America where we've been investing in Citibanamex has now had revenue growth and positive operating leverage for five straight quarters.
While trading revenues were down 7% from the prior period, which had benefited from a surge of activity following the UK referendum, our banking results were excellent.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 2% from last year driven by lower mortgage revenues.
WeÂre continuing to see positive results from the launch of our enhanced Citigold wealth management offering last year, driving growth in both households and balances with higher penetration on investment products.
Finally, retail services revenues of 1.6 billion were 4% reflecting loan growth and a favorable prior period comparison.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were $2.6 billion, up 6% from last year reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth, and continued investments partially offset by efficiency savings.
However, given the lower collections rate, our full-year NCL rate in retail services will likely be around 460 basis points versus our prior outlook of 435 basis points.
And expenses grew 4% in Latin America reflecting ongoing investment spending and business growth, partially offset by efficiency savings.
Higher card revenues reflecting 6% growth in average loans and 7% growth in purchase sales versus last year as well a modest gain from the sale of our merchant acquiring businesses in certain countries.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues of 2.1 billion grew 3% or 4% in constant dollars, driven by continued volume growth and improved deposit spreads.
While average loans were down modestly year over year, we saw good sequential growth, with volumes up 3% supporting core business activity among our global subsidiary clients.
Fixed income revenues of 3.2 billion, declined 6%, primarily reflecting lower G10 currencies revenues given lower volatility in the current quarter and a comparison to higher Brexit related activity a year ago.
Equities revenues were 11% lower versus last year reflecting episodic activity in the prior period as well as low volatility.
Investor client activity in equities remain strong however, with cash equities up year over year as well as continued growth in prime finance revenue and client balances.
Total operating expenses of 5 billion were up 5% year over year as higher incentive compensation, investments and volume related expenses were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Slide 9 shows our net interest revenue and margin insurance split by core accrual revenue, trading related revenue and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corporate/Other.
However, we still saw decline in the core accrual net interest margin to 344 basis points reflecting higher cash balances.
Market revenues will likely reflect a normal modest seasonal decline from the second quarter and investment banking revenues will likely return to a level closer to the first quarter perhaps a little lower assuming a seasonal slowdown in the third quarter underwriting activity.
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.
And we're running a little bit below that right now and I would anticipate probably for the full year legal and repositioning costs are probably going to come in somewhere around maybe 25 basis points less than we had originally guided.
Wanted to get along as just how the general struggles of traditional offline retailers might be affecting or affect that business in the future, maybe I'll start there and then I have a couple more detailed follow-ups.
It's hard to manage somebody from a client relationship when you've got one system that has their retail deposits, another one that has their credit card and another one that has their mortgage, another one that has their investment assets.
",44.11,0.56075376
CITI,q3,2017,"We have revenue increases in many of the product areas we have been investing in, tightly managed our expenses, and again saw loan and deposit growth in both our consumer and institutional businesses.
We've made progress towards the targets we discussed on Investor Day in terms of ROTCE 9.8% ex-DTA year-to-date and efficiency ratio of 57% year-to-date and we also returned over 6 billion of capital to our shareholders this quarter.
Turning to our businesses, in global consumer banking we generated revenue growth and positive operating leverage in all three regions Asia, Latin America, and North America.
In the U.S. retail banking and retail services both had growth and while we didn't see the year-over-year revenue growth weÂd anticipated in branded cards, we did show good sequential growth at 5% driven by growth in full rate balances and strong client engagement.
Revenues of $18.2 billion grew 2% from the prior year reflecting the gain on sale as well as 3% total growth in our consumer and institutional businesses.
The reserve build in cards was comprised of roughly $150 million for volume growth and normal seasoning in the portfolios, $50 million related to the estimated impact of the hurricanes, and about $300 million to cover our forward-looking NCL expectations.
Private Bank revenues of 785 million grew 15% year-over-year driven by growth in clients, loans, investment activity and deposits, as well as improved spreads.
Core accrual net interest revenue of 10.4 billion was up 5% or $450 million from last year driven by the impact of higher rates and volume growth, partially offset by a higher level of long-term debt.
On a sequential basis core accrual revenue grew by nearly $350 million this quarter reflecting day count, the impact of the June rate increase, loan growth, and mix.
Year-to-date core accrual revenue grew by $1.5 billion year-over-year and we expect to see roughly $500 million of additional growth in the fourth quarter.
However, on a full year basis we expect this increase to be offset by a roughly $900 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy wind down portfolio in Corporate/Other.
As we look to the fourth quarter, in consumer we expect continued modest year-over-year revenue growth and positive operating leverage in both North America and international consumer.
On the institutional side we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in our accrual businesses including TTS, the private bank, corporate lending, and security services.
And based upon the performance of the earlier vintages we expect these promotional balances will generate growth and full rate balances but, in the near-term we're seeing a dampening effect on revenues caused by this shift in focus.
And while the higher rates are overall accretive to the U.S. consumer business we've also talked about the fact that higher funding rates increase the near-term revenue drag caused by promotional balances.
Now as late as June we believe that despite the drag of the higher promo balances and the higher funding rates we'd still be in position to deliver at least some level of year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. brand cards beginning in the third quarter.
And then finally in branded cards we're looking at an NCL rate of about 10 basis point growth next year and that will go from about 285 this year to 295 next year.
So all things being equal I'd expect that the fourth quarter reserve build would be back in that range of $50 million to $100 million in branded cards that we would consider to be more normal.
And then again as we look forward and we think about the NCL rate next year being 30 to 35 basis points higher than what we had previously thought about, again you take 30 to 35 basis points, multiply it by a current $46 billion portfolio, adjust that for a 14 to 15 month coverage period and that gets you the extra $200 million reserve build there.
And just one quick strategic question on retail services, is this a portfolio and a business that you're looking to grow, do you see that growing or adding new partners or growth within the existing partners or is it something that probably feels pretty stable over the next few years?
So we think it's a really good business and unfortunately with those performance sharing arrangements that tend to obscure the true revenue trends and even in the near-term economics we end up having to build the loan loss reserves for all the NCL's that we're going to incur in that business even though some of those NCLs ultimately as theyÂre realized will go into the performance sharing arrangement and so it's actually our partners that will actually bear a significant percentage of those NCLs. John McDonald
If you remember Jim when we, as we've been talking about growth in net interest revenue year-over-year we've been focused on that core accrual line and we said that in the second half of the year we would expect that to grow about a billion dollars year-over-year and we saw a $450 million in the third quarter and we're looking at $500 million in the fourth quarter.
Just maybe a last one on this consumer credit issue, I mean when we looked at the medium term global consumer banking net loss rate you gave at Investor Day of 2.20 to 2.40, is everything you're seeing right now not just in retail card but pulling up across all the businesses is still consistent with that ranges, some of this pushing the range, what would be your mark-to-market on that to 2.20 to 2.40 guidance?
If I could just one last one in equities and security services, I know both are areas where youÂve invested for some time now, when you look at the recent momentum any sense of how much of that is market share and client gains versus how much of that is the backdrop?
So combining both elements of our equities franchise, we've got a growing and balanced business with good momentum going with both our corporate as well as our investor clients.
So we feel that what the quarter talks about, what year-to-date talks about is the balance and breadth of revenue growth and you can see the positive operating leverage across really almost all our business lines.
Mike I want to ask you a question going back to your opener, we've seen the metrics on the global growth start to improve mid single-digits year-over-year consumer and in some of the institutional businesses and I just want to a lot of enthusiasm for the emerging markets rebound that we've seen broadly speaking, you mentioned that the potential for the global disruption, can you just talk us through just like business momentum in the non-U.S. markets and maybe just touch on a couple of the biggest ones as well just to give us an understanding of kind of where we are in terms of that just organic growth improvement and where you might be worried about a little bit of a pause?
Well, the target that we set at the beginning of the year it includes all the expenses and all the revenue that we have when you take a look at how that $580 million gain is going to impact us.
Okay, fair enough, the second question on the overall health of the consumer, you talked about moving up your loss ratios from 470 million to 500 million and the longer-term changing, we are seeing increases in losses in an environment where you do have a very strong labor market, unemployment coming down.
So I'm curious as to how you're feeling just more broadly about the health of the consumer overall especially if we do start to see at some point down the line in the coming years some change in the labor market environment and do you think there is some risk in the medium-term to the losses, the expectations that you have in some parts of your consumer business?
Now the one thing that we know about cards is in trying to build this balanced portfolio with the balance business we're going to need to make adjustments as we go along every quarter.
You know we normally don't give too much guidance on the backlog but I think that you've seen that in the forward guidance that we've given towards the fourth quarter where we sort of said the investment banking revenues in the fourth quarter we expect to be pretty much on where we were in the third quarter.
But the retail banking revenues up 12% year-over-year, yes, that is getting a little bit a lift from interest rates but it still is good growth.
And now we've got cards revenues in Mexico that are actually have growth year-over-year.
Investor Day we said our anticipation is compound annual growth rate in revenues of 10%, we had been running at about 7% to 8%, we will probably be back to that 7% to 8% in the fourth quarter and then we should continue to grow into 2018 and 2019.
We like the wealth management business that we've got in Asia and again in both of those businesses five consecutive quarters of revenue growth and positive operating leverage.
And I talked about the retail banks so I think we've got really three good engines for growth in the future there in the consumer business.
Hello, and welcome to Citi's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Thank you Susan and good morning everyone.
And while tax reform remains a question mark we do like the direction the administration is going in terms of regulation which we see as just a course to accommodate higher growth rather than a full scale regulatory repeal agenda.
Hey, thanks Mike and good morning everyone.
Net income of $4.1 billion in the third quarter grew 8% from last year including a $580 million pretax gain on the sale of yield book, a fixed income analytics business which benefited EPS by $0.13 per share.
And cost of credit increased mostly reflecting volume growth, seasoning, hurricane and earthquake related loan loss reserve builds and additional reserve builds in North America cards which I'll cover in more detail shortly.
In constant dollars Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to 653 billion as 4% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 12% driven by continued growth in loans and assets under management as well as the benefit from higher interest rates.
Full rate revolving balances which had been flat since the beginning of the year began to grow this quarter as new loan vintages matured and started to accrue interest.
Total expenses for North America in consumer were $2.5 billion down 5% from last year as higher volume related expenses and investments were more than offset by efficiency savings.
Card revenues grew slightly year-over-year on continued improvement in full rate revolving loan trends.
And expenses also grew 4% in Latin America reflecting ongoing investment spending and business growth partially offset by efficiency savings.
Higher card revenues reflected 6% growth in average loans and 7% growth in purchase sales versus last year.
Total international credit costs grew 4% year-over-year mostly reflecting volume growth and seasoning in Latin America.
Turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 7, revenues of $9.2 billion grew 9% from last year reflecting the previously mentioned gain on sale as well as continued solid progress across the franchise.
Fixed income revenues of 2.9 billion declined 16% on lower G10 rates and currencies revenues given low volatility in the current quarter and the comparison to higher Brexit related activity a year ago as well as lower activity in spread products.
Total operating expenses of 4.9 billion increased 5% year-over-year as investments and volume related expenses were partially offset by efficiency savings.
As you can see total net interest revenue declined slightly from last year to 11.4 billion as growth in core accrual revenue was outpaced by the wind down of legacy assets as well as lower trading related net interest revenue.
In the third quarter our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 13% as net income was more than offset by $6.4 billion of common share buybacks and dividends.
Market revenues will likely reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter.
I think it's an area John if opportunities present themselves as we've seen in Best Buy and other and if portfolios make sense we clearly got the capital balance sheet, liquidity capacity, and if the returns makes sense weÂd be happy to take them on.
Thanks and then maybe a question I get a lot, I know it's a little bit of a lost cause to forecast trading related NII -- I can't be forecasting rating so, but like why is it down across the whole industry not just you so much, is it just simply trading books are liability sensitive so, there's a little bit of give back there or why are we seeing these trade related NII numbers come under so much pressure?
Thanks, I wanted a very small minor item but when you look at your security gains you've had about $200 million per quarter, as rates are kind of generally moving higher just to know if you were trying to reposition or do some things in that particular portfolio by taking those gains.
I have a question, obviously and I don't mean to sell short the efforts you have made in capital markets because you've done a great job in investing in your businesses and you showed us today like you did Investor Day gaining the wallet shift.
Again going back we focused a number of years ago around what we said growth is going to look and feel like for us is not a whole lot of new client acquisition.
",50.13,0.7922173
CITI,q4,2017,"As you know, our net income for the fourth quarter and the year reflect the impact of the onetime non-cash charge due to tax reform and I'll go into some more detail about that after I discuss our business performance.
We did have a decline in Markets revenue due to a less robust environment this quarter than in the period following the US election last year, but engagement remains strong with our target clients.
Revenue growth and strong expense management brought us to a full year efficiency ratio of 57.7%, an improvement of over 150 basis points from 2016.
Starting on Slide 3, before we go into our operating results, I do want to spend a few minutes on the impact of tax reform on our fourth quarter as well as the benefits we expect going forward.
As noted on the table, our fourth quarter results included a onetime non-cash charge of $22 billion or $8.43 per share comprised of roughly $19 billion due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets or DTA arising from the lower US corporate tax rate as well as the shift to a territorial regime and roughly $3 billion related to the deemed repatriation of un-remitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
On an ongoing basis, we expect to benefit from a lower effective tax rate, going from the low 30% range down to an estimated 25% rate in 2018 with a line of sight to a 24% rate over the next 2 years.
And finally, the combination of a lower tax rate and, therefore, higher net income along with the $22 billion reduction in our tangible common equity is expected to drive a material improvement in returns, adding roughly 200 basis points to our RoTCE going forward.
On this basis, net income was $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from the prior year, and earnings per share of $1.28 grew 12%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.
Revenues of $17.3 billion grew 1% from the prior year, reflecting 2% aggregate growth in our Consumer and Institutional businesses offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other as we continued to wind down legacy assets.
On a full year basis, total revenues grew 2% in 2017, including 6% aggregate growth in our Consumer and Institutional businesses.
Total expenses remained flat, driving over 150 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio to just under 58%, and net income grew 6%, resulting in a 13% increase in earnings per share, including the impact of share buybacks.
Our RoTCE, excluding the impact of disallowed DTA, improved to 9.6% in 2017, showing good progress towards our original Investor Day target of a 10% return on this basis in 2018.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 5% year-over-year to $667 billion as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
In Global Consumer Banking, we generated 4% revenue growth and nearly 100 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio.
Of course, our ICG results benefited from a gain on sale in the third quarter, but even excluding the gain, we generated 6% revenue growth and over 100 basis points of efficiency improvement in 2017.
From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 14% driven by continued growth in checking deposits and deposit margin, growth in investments and loans and increased commercial banking activity.
We continued to generate growth in total interest-earning balances this quarter, up about 4% year-over-year, excluding our Hilton portfolio, as recent vintages continued to mature as expected, partially offset by the runoff of non-core balances.
As we look forward, we expect interest earning balances to continue to grow while promotional rate loans should stabilize and then begin to decline in 2018 as we continue to take actions to adjust our acquisition strategy in a rising rate environment.
Net credit losses grew by 7% year-over-year and we built roughly $150 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning in the portfolios.
Net income grew 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter driven by revenue growth, positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline.
And card revenues grew by 11%, reflecting continued growth in average loans and purchase sales as well as a modest gain on the sale of a merchant acquiring business.
Private Bank revenues of $771 million grew 15% year-over-year driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits as well as improved spreads.
Fixed Income revenues of $2.4 billion declined 18%, reflecting continued low volatility as well as the comparison to a more robust trading environment last year in the wake of the US elections.
For the full year 2017, our net income grew 16% on the combination of revenue growth, positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline.
In Fixed Income, while the trading environment proved to be challenging this year with low volatility and fewer macro catalysts, we continued to see strong engagement with our corporate clients as they leveraged our global network, particularly in rates and currencies.
Core accrual revenues grew year-over-year by over $500 million in the fourth quarter, in line with our outlook, but this was offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the anticipated wind down of legacy assets.
On a full year basis, core accrual revenue grew by $2 billion over 2016, again, in line with our outlook.
As we look to 2018, we expect core accrual net interest revenues to grow by another $2.5 billion year-over-year driven by loan growth, mix improvement and the benefit of higher rates assuming one additional Fed rate increase mid year.
In the fourth quarter, our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12.3% driven by $6.3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, as well as the estimated $6 billion reduction in CET1 capital due to tax reform, which, as I noted earlier, had a roughly 40 basis point impact.
For the full year 2018, we expect top line growth broadly in line with the medium term outlook we described in July at around 3%, plus or minus, with stronger growth in our operating businesses being offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets.
This combination of higher earnings before tax, continued capital return and the impact of tax reform is expected to drive a significant improvement in RoTCE in 2018.
Excluding the impact of tax reform, our return on total tangible common equity improved to roughly 8% in 2017 and we expect to make additional progress this year.
I think the rule of thumb, John, would be that for each additional quarter that we had an incremental 25 basis point rate - impact of - a Fed rate hike, we should see an increment of about $80 million of core interest revenue.
Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and that inflection in Mexico Consumer, as well as Asia on a core basis and maybe what kind of revenue growth expectations you might have on the International Consumer front?
I'd say that from a medium-term point of view, John, what we're seeing now gives us confidence in those projections that we put forward for Investor Day. So I don't want you to think that we are upping the guidance from Investor Day. But with this performance, as I mentioned, let's stay with Mexico cards.
It was lessening, but we wouldn't think that we were going to return to year-over-year revenue growth until the fourth quarter of this year.
If you think about it, what this means is we put up, I think, at Investor Day a compound annual growth rate for U.S. branded cards over the 3.5-year period was going to be 3%.
At the same point in time, retail services, we had, I think a 1% compound annual growth rate built in and we feel pretty good now about that looking more like a 2% growth rate.
All in all, a pretty good trade-off and that gives you some idea as that - why we're seeing - why we're talking about this strong improvement in our overall ability to generate and, therefore, return capital.
We're actually -- if you do -- if you continue to do the math, though, I talked about the fact that we're getting a 900 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate in 2020.
And if you actually do the math on that, you're going to scratch your head and say, well, wait a minute, this looks like a 900 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate should actually drive a much higher improvement to RoTCE than the 200 basis points that Mike and John are talking about.
But I think, John, if you look at it as an example, fee growth, where you think of where we've seen good growth, Matt, is when you look in the banking products, when you look at, as John talked about, market share gains in M&A, you look at what we've done in terms of the private bank, securities services, lending, those more accrual type revenues have been strong.
As an example, when you look at the Mexico investment that we've made, which I think we clearly have to acknowledge as having been helpful in terms of the 6% revenue growth in Mexico today, you look at 3 things there.
I think there's nothing really outside of what we've described, but a big emphasis towards digital, towards technology, towards new and smart banking as we go forward and then, obviously, continued investments in place like our TTS businesses and all the things that we've talked about.
So what we said is think in terms of the gain that we book in the first quarter will basically offset the revenue loss of Hilton for the balance of the year.
I think, right now, growth forecasts look like Mexico is probably going to come in somewhere around 2.1%.
And you have $2 billion of core accrual net interest revenue growth for the full year, $520 million of that in the fourth quarter.
The other thing I was going to ask you was we've talked a lot about the improvement in returns and earnings as you go forward but not a lot about reduction in the tangible book value as you change the DTA this quarter.
Hello and welcome to Citi's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
The Institutional Clients Group saw continued momentum with double-digit growth in its banking products comprised of TTS, Investment Banking, Private Bank and Corporate Lending.
Not only do we remain committed to returning at least $60 billion of capital during the current and next 2 CCAR cycles, obviously subject to regulatory approval, but we feel confident about our ability to generate capital going forward.
From a business perspective, it's a great opportunity to advise our clients on how they can optimize their models to fit the new tax regime.
Tax reform could change the sentiment among those making investment decisions from optimism to confidence and become the boost the US economy needs to drive growth higher.
The U.S. consumer should also benefit as higher take-home pay could drive either increased discretionary spending or the acceleration of payment of existing debt, each a potential positive outcome from the reduction in tax rates.
We believe the combination of higher income and reduced tangible common equity will have a meaningful positive impact on our returns, improving return on tangible common equity by about 200 basis points going forward.
In all, tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns, but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward.
These results include a combined net benefit of roughly $0.08 per share from discrete items that resulted in a lower than expected tax rate, as well as a onetime loss in discontinued operations.
Expenses were flat year-over-year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets.
Slide 6 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
Total revenues of $8.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year with positive operating leverage in both North America and our international franchise.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were flat to last year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were offset by efficiency savings.
We continue to drive transaction volumes to lower cost channels and digital engagement remains strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users, including 21% growth among mobile users versus last year.
Retail banking revenues grew 7% in the fourth quarter with broad-based volume growth across deposits, commercial loans and personal loans, as well as improved deposit spreads.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.2 billion were up 9%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with balanced growth across net interest and fee income.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 10% from last year with wallet share gains for the year across debt and equity underwriting and M&A.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.4 billion declined 17% from last year.
Excluding this item, Equities revenues declined by 4% from last year, reflecting lower activity in corporate equity derivatives, while investor client engagement remains strong.
And finally, credit costs were $267 million in the fourth quarter, predominantly driven by the same single client event, while overall portfolio quality remains strong.
Securities Services grew 8% as we continued to deepen client relationships while also benefiting from the higher rate environment.
And trading related net interest revenue declined by nearly $1.7 billion year-over-year with about 2/3 of this decline coming from higher wholesale funding costs.
And trading related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment.
In terms of earnings power, the macro backdrop has only gotten stronger with all major global markets having returned to growth and the US poised to benefit from a more competitive tax regime.
In the US, while branded cards has gotten off to a slow start, likely delaying growth in that business until 2019, we showed good traction with our Citigold Wealth Management investment and retail services is growing at slightly above our medium-term outlook.
And while there are lots of moving pieces, we believe our ability to generate regulatory capital has only improved post tax reform as higher net income should more than offset any reduction in our annual DTA utilization.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.
And you mentioned overall, even with US card being a little light, your overall Consumer revenue trajectory feels good relative to the Investor Day targets?
Yes. I don't think we ever talked about a very specific 2018 goal at that point, but getting another 100 basis point reduction fits in with the pace that we had built into that Investor Day presentation.
Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Yes. I think John's talked about a backdrop where we'll see trading remains choppy.
Next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Yes, if you take a look at the - I'm not quite sure that there's a norm because each product has got its own offering.
Our next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
Our next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS.
Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
Yes, just wanted to understand whether you think about pricing is actually going a bit lower.
If you have any questions, please reach out to Investor Relations.

CITI,q1,2018,"Hello, and welcome to Citi's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Our earnings per share were 24% higher than 1 year ago as a result of strong business performance, a lower tax rate and a continued reduction in shares outstanding as we execute our capital return plans.
Global Consumer Banking had a good all-around quarter with 6% revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region.
While Fixed Income revenues were lower than a year ago, driven by less investor activity, our Equities business saw its best quarter in many years, giving us confidence that our investments are delivering results.
We also saw ongoing momentum in TTS, our Private Bank, Corporate Lending and Securities Services as we continued to grow these stable accrual-type businesses.
While Investment Banking revenue was down, we held on to the wallet share gains we've made in recent years, and client engagement remained strong.
Net income of $4.6 billion in the first quarter grew 13% from last year as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate.
Expenses increased 2% year-over-year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets.
GCB and ICG loans grew by $44 billion in total with contribution from every region in consumer as well as TTS to Private Bank and traditional Corporate Lending.
Excluding the impact of additional partnership terms that went into effect in January, we delivered roughly 2% underlying revenue growth in our U.S.-branded cards business this quarter, consistent with our full year 2018 outlook.
Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 2%, driven by higher average loans.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were up 2% as higher volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.
We continue to drive transaction volumes through lower-cost channels, and digital engagement remained strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users, including 25% growth among mobile users versus last year.
Net credit losses grew by 9% year-over-year, and we billed roughly $119 million of loan loss reserve this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning.
First quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew 8% with contribution from every business and region.
And card revenues grew 13% on continued growth in purchase sales and full-rate revolving loans as well as a favorable prior period comparison.
Revenues of $9.8 billion increased 6% from last year, driven by continued momentum in our accrual businesses [indiscernible] a very strong performance in Equities this quarter.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 8%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with solid growth across both net interest and fee income.
And Corporate Lending revenues of $521 million were up 19%, reflecting loan growth as well as lower hedging costs.
Total Markets & Securities Services revenues of $5 billion grew 3% from last year.
Corporate client activity remained strong, driving growth in G10 FX and local markets rates and currencies.
However, this was more than offset by lower investor client activity and a less favorable environment in G10 Rates and spread products, in particular in March.
Equities revenues were up 38% with growth across all products as volatility trended higher and we saw continued momentum with investor clients, in line with our investment strategy.
And our core accrual net interest margin improved by 8 basis points to 354 basis points, driven by the rate increase, loan growth and lower average cash balances as we use liquidity to fund higher-yielding assets.
Legacy asset-related net interest revenues should continue to decline by about $500 million this year as we wind down that portfolio.
Our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12.1% this quarter due to an increase in RWA, driven by loan growth and client activity as well as $3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, partially offset by net income.
In summary, we made good progress towards our longer-term goals this quarter with solid revenue growth, positive operating leverage and a significant improvement in net income and returns.
And then just conceptually, I mean, how much of the franchise, when we look at these Asian revenues, are kind of global corporates doing business versus maybe a notch below like more local companies?
And that gives us a fairly strong foundation in our rates and currency business because corporations need to fund their balance sheet every day, which means every day, you've got the ability to have a conversation with either a global treasurer or a local treasurer about what he or she needs to do in order to make payments, fund their working capital needs.
We told you that core accrual net interest revenue should grow $2.7 billion this quarter -- I mean, this year.
Our quarter showed strong and balanced performance as we continued to capture client-led growth, and we remain on track to deliver on the targets we announced at Investor Day. Relative to a year ago, we grew revenues by 3%, improved our efficiency ratio to just under 58%, increased our return on assets to 98 basis points and improved our return on tangible common equity to 11.4%.
We grew loans in our core businesses by 7% or $44 billion from last year, and we ended the quarter with over $1 trillion in deposits.
In branded cards, we saw the underlying revenue growth that we projected, driven by an increase in interest-earning balances and strong client engagement.
Revenues of $18.9 billion grew 3% from the prior year, reflecting 7% aggregate growth in our consumer and institutional businesses, offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other as we continued to wind down legacy assets.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 6% year-over-year to $673 billion as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
Total revenues of $8.4 billion grew 6% year-over-year and were up 4%, excluding the impact of the Hilton portfolio sale, which resulted in a gain this quarter, partially offset by the loss of operating revenues for a net benefit of about $120 million in our U.S.-branded cards business.
From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the first quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 8%, driven by continued growth in deposit margins, growth in investments and loans and increased commercial banking activity.
We continued to generate growth in total interest-earning balances this quarter, up about 6% year-over-year, excluding Hilton, as recent vintages continued to mature, as expected, partially offset by the runoff of non-core balances.
Retail banking revenues grew 7% in the first quarter, driven by growth in loans and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads.
In total, operating expenses grew 5% in the first quarter as investment spending and volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings, and cost of credit was essentially flat.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 10% from last year, generally in line with the overall market and reflecting the timing of episodic deal activity.
Private Bank revenues of $904 million grew 21% year-over-year, driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads.
As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.2 billion this quarter grew slightly from last year.
On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew slightly, reflecting the December rate hike as well as loan growth, partially offset by the impact of lower day count.
On a full year basis, we now expect core accrual net interest revenue to grow by over $2.7 billion in 2018 as we've added the impact of the recent March rate hike to our original outlook, which had called for $2.5 billion of growth, assuming only one fed rate increase in June.
And trading-related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we saw in the first quarter.
Looking to the second quarter for total Citigroup, we expect top line growth to continue broadly in line with the pace we set this quarter at around 3%, plus or minus, with stronger growth in our operating businesses being offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets.
In consumer, we expect continued revenue growth in U.S. retail banking, retail services, Mexico and Asia.
And we expect continued revenue growth in our accrual businesses, TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network.
Yes, the accounting changes impacted our overall efficiency by 50, 60 basis points, so I don't think that, that really changes our target of getting into the low 50s at all.
Now I'll give you the fact that when you take a look at the first quarter efficiency ratio of 57.9%, it certainly is above the 57% target that we got in place for the full year, but it's not inconsistent with our plan for the rest of the year.
And so when you look at the rest of the year, I think you have to expect continued top line momentum.
And finally, as I noted, I believe when I spoke at the RBC conference, we're taking the opportunity today to invest in the franchise to both to continue top line momentum as well as to capture significant efficiency savings that we've outlined for you at Investor Day. Now we're seeing much of the year-over-year impact of growth in these investments in the first half of 2018.
So think in terms of investment spending being a bit more front-end loaded in 2018 and the resulting efficiency benefits then begin to ramp up in the second half of the year.
So there's a structural element of the balance sheet, but I don't think that we want to get into putting on -- having an interest rate view of businesses that are trading interest rates.
It's actually a build-on of things that we saw building from the second half of last year, and I think it speaks to a lot of the growing economies in Asia, a little bit more positive outlook.
One of the biggest questions I get on you guys surrounds the card -- U.S. card business and how to think about or size the TCA rate impact and how it can maybe rebound eventually in terms of conversion rates and with the size of the portfolio.
I mean, we can maybe take an educated guess, but if there's any kind of help you can give us in trying to think through what -- how the portfolio is sized today and how much you think you'll end up with in terms of paying balances next year and beyond.
So we're never going to drive it to 0 because it certainly is an important piece of the growth strategy for the business, but it will get a little -- we acknowledge that it was a little outsized last year because we pulled back from trying to grow in the rewards product area and focused instead on the promo balances in value and whatnot.
And I thought the new data point, you said there's 6% growth in interest-earning balances, and I think that would compare to 4% growth in the fourth quarter.
Well, I think that, again, you're going to see, once we get past '18, we talked about some of the revenue impacts in '18 holding the overall business revenues flat.
If you look at that now, basically I think if you look year-over-year, even with that percentage declining, we're still getting growth in net interest revenue in U.S.-branded cards, ex Hilton, something north of 2%, 2.4%, 2.3%.
And so our guidance had been that for each quarter, we get an additional 25 basis point rate hike, it should add about $80 million worth of net interest revenue for the year.
And so -- and I think this quarter's performance at least provides a point of evidence for it, although we were building up market share all during last year as well.
It sounds from what I could glean that given the growth that you're contemplating or anticipating within core accrual NII as well as the declines or more subdued revenues on the trading NII side as well as the legacy runoff book, it feels like, for the full year, we should see NII relatively flat.
Yes, actually, we continue to see credit performing very, very well, whether it be in the North America businesses or in Mexico or in Asia when it comes to consumer.
And what John referenced before is what we laid out in the Investor Day around this $1.5 billion of efficiency we think we can get out of our consumer business.

CITI,q2,2018,"And welcome to CitiÂs Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that todayÂs presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on managementÂs current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
Investment banking revenue delivered another solid quarter with good growth in advisory and equity underwriting.
Branded Cards should face headwinds, but weÂre seeing underlying momentum that gives us confidence in growth going forward.
WeÂre focused on transforming the client experience across our franchise, driving digital solutions for both our consumer and institutional clients, while lowering our costs through automation or other service improvements.
So our capital planning has been effective, reducing our common shares outstanding by over 200 million over the past year to just over 2.5 billion shares, which helped drive our EPS up by 20%.
Branded Cards has grown 1%, we are seeing underlying improvements in 2018 that gives us confidence in a stronger trajectory going forward.
And while Mexico was somewhat below its 10% target, weÂve seen an improving growth trend over the past few quarters.
Fixed Income markets have been challenging, but weÂve offset this pressure with solid double-digit revenue growth in our accrual businesses TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services and weÂre also seeing significant growth in equities.
As Mike noted earlier, we recently announced plans to return an additional $22 billion in dividends and buybacks over the next 12 months.
Slide five shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
We launched the first set of foundational features in May on our mobile app, including the ability for retail banking clients to view and analyze their full financial position across firms.
Bean card portfolio, which added $1.5 billion of high quality receivables at quarter end.
On slide seven, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
Slide eight shows the global consumer credit trends in more detail.
Credit continued to be favorable again this quarter with NCL and delinquency rates broadly stable across regions.
Our CET1 capital ratio remain roughly flat sequentially at 12.1% this quarter, as net income was offset by $3.1 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, and our tangible book value per share increased slightly to $61.29.
Second, is how weÂre using technology to streamline our own operations, things like straight through application processing, the use of big data and branch optimization.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Curious if there are one or two products that youÂre most confident and thatÂs going to drive that pick up in the second half and 2019?
Hi. I think the second half revenue comps are hopefully relatively easy and its sounds like youÂre pretty confident on the expense side.
But it feels like there should be some bigger payback at some point beyond just 1% or 2% revenue growth.
Your next question is from line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.
Every second quarter there is dividend season in Europe.
So, can you walk us through just how U.S. rate curves versus non-U.S. rate curves are affecting how youÂre looking at deposit growth and what youÂre paying in different markets and itÂs just a type of improvement that we should start seeing in terms of incremental betas from here?
John, can you share with us -- youÂre ruling up the national digital platform as you described.
WeÂre seeing really nice growth in our mobile NPS right now.
Are there any other in the pipeline types of bidding that youÂre doing where we could hear further announcements, second half of this year or early next year on Branded or on wins like this?
In this case L.L. I just didnÂt notice in Asia there was -- looked like you had an uptick in corporate and non-performers, again itÂs not a major issue.
Hi. Just -- wanted to just ask one question, I want to make sure I heard what Mike was saying earlier.
As we think about 2019, the ROA in North American Branded Cards should continue to -- should be improving from here regardless of any new partnerships that you may win?
Hi. YouÂve been discussing your international consumer strategy mainly in terms of online and mobile banking and so on.
In the U.S., we continued to grow our retail banking business and we closed the acquisition of the L.L. Bean portfolio in retail services and in U.S. Branded Cards, we saw strong interest earning balance growth as our investments continue to mature.
While Fixed Income was in line with what we forecasted, our equities business had another strong quarter, up 19% from the year before and our accrual businesses continued to show strong growth across the board, especially Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services, Corporate Lending, and the Private Bank.
Taking a step back for a moment, was almost a year ago since we brought you all together to lay out our 2020 targets, so I think this morning is a good opportunity to recap some of the progress weÂve made since Investor Day. As you may recall, at the time, I spoke about three strategic priorities we would pursue to reach those financial targets.
In consumer, our Wealth Management capabilities have been enhanced both through branch-based and digital outreach, and we significantly increased the amount of Citigold households here in the U.S. Internationally, Mexico is starting to see the revenue levels weÂve forecasted, as we execute our investment plan there and our Asia franchise continues to grow.
Clearly, U.S. On the second priority, weÂve continued to drive our digital transformation and invest for growth, while self funding these investments through efficiency savings.
And overall, weÂve improved our operating efficiency year-over-year for seven straight quarters and weÂre on track to reach the low 50s by 2020.
Revenues of $18.5 billion grew 2% from the prior year, driven by higher net interest revenues and expenses were flat, as higher volume-related expenses and investments were fully offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets.
Now looking at the first half of 2018, we generated modest revenue growth and positive operating leverage, with roughly 90 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio.
In North America, our retail banking and retail services businesses are broadly on pace and while U.S. In Asia, we outperformed our 4% medium-term growth target, driven by strength in Wealth Management revenues.
WeÂve ramped up investments across the franchise to support this client led growth, but over the past year, weÂve been able to fully offset this additional spend and volume driven growth through efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, resulting in flat expenses in total.
Net income grew 15% in the second quarter, driven by operating margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by a higher cost of credit.
Global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the second quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs, even as we continue to shrink our physical branch footprint.
However, this gain was partially offset in the second quarter by the impact of repricing actions on a small portion of our card accounts related to the previously disclosed issues with APR rate re-evaluation under the CARD Act. For the full year, we expect the impact of these repricing actions to be roughly $50 million.
In total, we continue to expect branded card revenues excluding Hilton to be roughly flat this year on a reported basis, with around 2% underlying growth, driven by continued strong client engagement, loan growth and improved mix.
Excluding Hilton, purchase sales grew 10% year-over-year in the quarter and average loans grew 5%, including 6% growth in interest-earning balances as recent vintages continue to mature.
This growth rate is likely to accelerate over the next few quarters, reflecting the recent acquisition of the L.L. Excluding the impact of this provision, expenses were up 1% as higher volume-related expenses and investments were largely offset by efficiency savings.
Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by 8% year-over-year and we billed roughly $117 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning.
Retail banking revenues grew 12% in the second quarter, driven by growth in loans and deposits.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 2% year-over-year in the second quarter and were up 4% excluding the benefit of a modest one-time gain in the prior year.
Retail banking revenues grew 4%, reflecting continued strength in Wealth Management, despite a sequential slowdown in investment revenues and excluding the one-time gain last year, card revenues also grew 4% on continued growth in loans and purchase sales.
In total, operating expenses were up 4% in the second quarter, as investment spending and volumes driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Revenues of $9.7 billion increased 3% from last year, driven by continued momentum in our accrual businesses, along with a strong performance in equity this quarter.
Total Banking revenues of $5.2 billion grew 6%, Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 11%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with solid growth across both net interest and fee income.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were down 7% from last year, as growth in M&A and equity underwriting was more than offset by a very strong prior-year comparison in debt underwriting.
Private Bank revenues of $848 million grew 7% year-over-year driven by growth in clients, loans and investments, as well as improved deposit spreads.
Equities revenues were up 19%, with growth across all products, reflecting the benefit of continued higher market volatility, as well as continued momentum with investor clients in line with our investment strategy.
Total operating expenses of $5.5 billion increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher compensation costs and an increase in business volumes, along with higher levels of investments spending, partially offset by productivity savings.
As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.7 billion this quarter grew roughly 12% from last year, as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading related net interest revenue, as well as the wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew approximately $550 million, reflecting the benefit of higher rates, as well as loan growth, along with the impact of one additional day in the quarter and our core accrual net interest margin also improved by 6 basis points, primarily reflecting higher rates.
Looking ahead for the remainder of the year, we are updating our prior outlook for growth in core accrual net interest revenue from roughly $2.7 billion to $3.4 billion for full year 2018, reflecting loan growth, improved mix and lower than expected retail deposits sensitivity in the first half of the year, as well as an additional rate hike in September that had not been included in our original outlook.
Although, the retail deposit betas have run lower than anticipated so far this year, we do expect higher sensitivity going forward, which is reflected in our outlook.
Finally, we continue to expect legacy asset related net interest revenues to decline by about $500 million this year as we wind down that portfolio.
And trading related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we saw in the first and second quarters.
In Consumer, in North America we should see continued progress in retail banking and retail services, including a full quarter contribution from L.L. Branded Cards growth will continue to be impacted by the Hilton sale on a year-over-year basis.
However, we do expect the net interest revenue percentage to improve sequentially beginning this quarter as our loan mix continues to improve.
Expenses should continue to decline sequentially in both the third and fourth quarters, and this should keep us on pace to again deliver roughly 100 basis points of efficiency improvement similar to what we achieved in the first half of the year.
Second, are the incremental investments weÂre making to both deepen our client relationships and improve the efficiency of our operations.
If we look at what weÂve achieved so far over the past year, weÂve deployed nearly half of the $1.5 billion of incremental investments, with a somewhat heavier emphasis in consumer initially and now across both consumer and ICG, and at the same time, weÂve only realized roughly a third of the estimated $2.5 billion of efficiency savings.
If you do the math, youÂll see that the incremental investments were funded through efficiency savings over the past year, while other volume driven expenses were essentially offset through the wind down of legacy assets.
So weÂre not yet at a point where the efficiency savings are outpacing the incremental investment spend but that should change as we go forward.
The lower hedging costs, thatÂs something weÂve actually talked about, I think, for the last several quarters, that itÂs a combination of two things, Glenn.
Thanks for the comments about the trajectory of your investment spend versus the cost saves that was helpful to thinking about your path of efficiency improvement.
I just want to reiterate based on the targets and the pickup and saves youÂre expecting, this year youÂre kind of running at a pace for about 100 basis point efficiency improvement, and it sounds like thatÂs going to accelerate next year to kind of a 200 basis point improvement pace starting next year I guess.
So, I donÂt want you to think that 11% is going to be every quarter, but again over the next two and half years [inaudible] at or close to that 10% CAGR that we put out at Investor Day. Thank you.
Hi, Jim. Maybe just a follow up on sort of the growth in outside the U.S. ItÂs obviously been ticking up, but I think investors are pretty concerned about what weÂve seen lately in terms of emerging market or at least equity markets and tariffs and NAFTA.
But how do we think about where those incremental investments could go, would it be more to accelerate efficiency saves, potentially, letÂs say, in the Institutional side or would it be more for revenue growth drive -- driven those investments or a combination of both?
But I think we would look at a combination of both revenue growth investments and continued efficiency.
So weÂre in there, so as John said, when we get into budget weÂre going to be looking at opportunities that we have in the firm of where we can make investments and get some strong near-term savings and paybacks, and thatÂs why at this point, we really donÂt want to commit to exactly how the 400 breaks between Â19 and Â20, because we may have some things that we can pull forward that are actually cost us a little bit in Â19, but have the ability to pay back in Â20.

CITI,q3,2018,"We continue to see solid growth this quarter in many areas, including our accrual businesses and ICG, fixed income, and Mexico Consumer and despite a drag from net one-time gains that affected our top line comparisons, we still achieve positive operating leverage for the quarter, driving our efficiency ratio down to 56.1%.
We're on track to achieve our 2018 financial target, on a year-to-date basis we've generated 4% underlying growth in aggregate across our consumer and institutional businesses.
And in the U.S., we're starting to see the impact of the L.L. Branded Cards had sequential revenue growth and given strong growth in interest earning balances, we remain on course to achieve 2% underlying revenue growth for the year.
Fixed Income and equities were up 7% in total and as in the past our accrual businesses, TTS Security Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank all showed strong year-over-year growth.
Revenues of $18.4 billion were roughly flat to the prior year, reflecting the net impact of one-time gain in the third quarters of both 2017 and 2018, as well as FX translation.
In constant dollars, total revenues excluding these gains grew by 4% in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in our institutional franchise.
Looking at year-to-date results on slide four, you can see aggregate revenues in our consumer and institutional businesses have grown 4% this year, excluding the previously mentioned gains.
On an underlying basis, institutional revenues have grown 4% in line with our medium term expectations, driven by our accrual businesses in treasury and trade solutions, securities services, lending and the private bank and consumer revenues have grown 3% in constant dollars, somewhat below our medium term goal.
Now this is primarily driven by the near-term impact of weaker market sentiment on our Asia Wealth Management revenues, the impact of partnership terms that came into effect earlier this year in U.S. branded cards, which we will lap as we go into 2019.
Net income grew 36% in the third quarter, largely driven by lower cost of credit, a lower effective tax rate and the gain on the sale of Mexico Asset Management business.
Total revenues of $8.7 billion, grew 3% year-over-year, reflecting the strength in Latin America as well as the one-time gain, and expenses increased by 6% year-over-year, driven by the timing of investment initiatives versus the prior year.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 1% in the third quarter, a slower pace than we saw in the first half of the year largely reflecting lower episodic transaction activity in commercial banking, as well as increasing rate sensitivity.
Turning to Branded Cards, revenues were down 3% from last year, including the impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio, as well as previously mentioned partnership terms that went into effect earlier this year.
Now excluding Hilton, purchase sales grew 11% year-over-year in the quarter and average loans grew 4%, including 7% growth in interest-earning balances as recent vintages continued to mature.
For the full year, we continue to expect reported revenues in Branded Cards to be roughly flat; however we remain on track to achieve 2% underlying growth.
Finally, retail services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 2%, driven by organic loan growth, as well as the full quarter benefit of the recent acquisition of the L.L. On a sequential basis, expenses were roughly flat and should remain stable into the fourth quarter.
Third quarter revenues of $3.5 billion grew 11%, driven by strength in Latin America, as well as the previously mentioned one-time gain.
In Latin America, excluding the gain, total consumer revenues grew 8%, driven by continued volume growth across commercial, mortgage and card loans, as well as deposits.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the third quarter, as continued growth in deposit, lending and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues, given a weaker market sentiment.
Over the last 12 months, Asia Consumer revenues grew 4%, in line with our medium term expectations, driven by 5% growth in revenues excluding investment products.
And we are continuing to increase the proportion of more stable accrual type investment revenues, as our business in Asia today is more sensitive to upfront transaction fees than in other regions.
And constant credit grew 17%, reflecting loan growth as well as the impact of a reserve release in Asia in the prior year period.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide nine, excluding the impact of a prior year gain, revenues of $9.2 billion increased 4% in the third quarter and were also up 4% on a year-to-date basis, with strength in both banking and markets.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 8% from last year as growth in M&A was more than offset by a decline in underwriting fees, reflecting lower market activity.
Private Bank revenues of $849 million grew 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in loans and investments as well as improved deposit spreads.
As you can see total net interest revenue were $11.8 billion this quarter, grew roughly 5% from last year, as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew approximately $270 million, reflecting the benefit of higher rates as well as loan growth along with the impact of one additional day in the quarter.
Year-to-date core accrual revenue grew by over $2.7 billion year-over-year and we expect to see additional growth in the fourth quarter that's roughly in line with the $970 million we saw this quarter.
However, as a reminder, on a full year basis, we expect this increase to be partially offset by a roughly $500 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy asset wind down portfolio in corporate/other.
And trading related net interest revenue will likely to continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we've seen year-to-date.
And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our accrual businesses, including Treasury and Trade Solutions, Securities Services, Lending and the Private Bank.
In U.S. Branded Cards, total revenues will continue to reflect the impact of the Hilton sale as well as partnership terms that went into effect earlier this year.
And we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in Asia and Mexico.
We've been talking about certainly during the first nine months of this year, which is that we continue to expect revenue growth largely in line with GDP and call that that 4% or so revenue growth in our core businesses, say 3% overall.
And one more quick follow-up in terms of the card revenues starting to look better next year seems like the core revenue growth rate feels like 2% this year and will accelerate next year on a core basis.
So, as we look forward, we expect those interest earning balances to continue to grow and then a larger percentage of that growth gradually comes from the higher margin proprietary product balances.
But if you take a look at it how it's performed over the past two years, the overall franchise has been growing at about 4% right in line with where we've targeted out to 2020.
I think you're going to see improved growth on that line when we get into next year, and we get beyond some of these one-off transactions.
And welcome to CitiÂs Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Investment banking was down versus last year as continued growth in M&A was more than offset by slower underwriting activity across the industry.
His experience in Asia where we operate a client centric franchise with strong digital adoption will help us bring North America to where it needs to be as we look to leverage both our brand and our scale in credit cards to drive deeper client relationships nationwide.
Despite the revenue headwind from net one-time gains, we achieved positive operating leverage this quarter with our efficiency ratio improving year-over-year to 56.1%.
Constant credit was down slightly versus last year as lower reserve builds in consumer were largely offset by volume growth and the normalization of credit costs in ICG.
GCB and ICG loans grew by 6% or $37 billion in total with contribution from every region in consumer, as well as TTS the private bank and traditional corporate lending.
Total expenses for North America consumer were up 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of investments versus the prior period.
The sequential increase in the NCL rate in Latin America reflected an episodic promotional charge-off that was fully offset by a related loan loss reserve release and therefore neutral to cost of credit.
And Corporate Lending revenues of $563 million were up 11%, reflecting loan growth along with lower hedging cost.
Total operating expenses of $5.2 billion increased 1% year-over-year, as higher compensation costs, investments and an increase in business volumes were partially offset by efficiency savings.
And pre-tax income was $65 million this quarter, better than our outlook reflecting higher treasury revenues and lower infrastructure expenses relative to our prior expectations.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a modest pre-tax loss in Corp/Other, mostly driven by seasonally higher franchise wide marketing and regulatory consulting cost, relative to the third quarter.
However core accrual net interest margin remain flat on a sequential basis, as the benefits of higher rates and loan growth were offset by higher average cash balances during the quarter.
In the third quarter our CET-1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 11.8% as net income was more than offset by share buybacks and dividends and we saw an increase in risk weighted assets related to client activity.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.
And just maybe just one other, maybe forgive me if I missed your comment on fix rating, but you guys obviously at least so far what weÂve seen outperformed I think our expectations.
And maybe a flip side question on Asia, good explanation on market sensitive stuff laying down decent underlying growth, but in the 4% 2020 target thatÂs a full package, right?
We saw pretty good underlying growth everything other than the wealth management.
Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
So will you be getting additional disclosure as relates to North America consumer whether itÂs digital banking or a slice indicing a few different ways for us externally?
Mike when you say additional disclosure you mean other than the break outs that we give you right now as far as Branded Cards, retail services and retail bank and then adding them all up together to be the North America region.
Or it could relate to more digital banking disclosure, how youÂre doing with products and customers or you had a lot more capability internally, given what you have done with project Rainbow and I thought that was a good reference like a decade or two to consolidate all the retail system and after all there is earlier acquisitions.
Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
And then separately, could you just walk us through how you're thinking about planning for the potential risk of the Sears [ph] bankruptcy either filing Chapter 7, Chapter 11 not sure which way itÂs going to go right now, but seemingly likely to come on Monday.
Mike, I think in your opening comments you mentioned that you felt pretty good about the investment banking pipeline and upcoming transactions.
Your final question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.

CITI,q4,2018,"And despite the market conditions we experienced throughout the fourth quarter, we still improved our operating efficiency to 57% for the year.
In addition, we grew loans and deposits in constant dollars by 4% and 7% respectively, improved our return on assets to 93 basis points and managed our effective tax rate down to the 23% range, a little better than we had forecast.
Our expense base declined by 4% both year-over-year and sequentially this quarter, taking our annual expense base to below $42 billion, and we continued to prudently manage risk-weighted assets to optimize our capital needs.
Our accrual businesses, which consist of Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services, the Private Bank, and Corporate Lending continued their very strong performance, up 11% for the full year in constant dollars.
In Global Consumer Banking, in the US, we saw 4% underlying growth in Branded Cards and 6% revenue growth in Retail Services this quarter, and Retail Banking grew 5% ex-mortgages.
Internationally, we saw good growth in Mexico, especially in the cards products, while Asia was impacted by lower revenues from investment products.
As I mentioned before, we have levers we can pull if revenues come in lower, but we're very cognizant of the need to invest for the long-term so that we can serve our clients with distinction.
Now, looking at our results on this basis, net income of $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter grew 14% from last year driven by a reduction in expenses, lower cost of credit, and a lower effective tax rate, and EPS grew 26% including the impact of an 8% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.
Revenues of $17.1 billion declined 2% from the prior year, primarily reflecting a lower Fixed Income Markets revenues as well as the wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.
Institutional revenues also grew 3%, as strength in our accrual businesses in Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank was partially offset by weakness in Fixed Income, as well as softness in equity and debt underwriting.
Excluding mortgage, Retail Banking revenues grew 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, slightly better growth than we saw in the third quarter, and deposit spreads stabilized in our commercial portfolio, and we faced fewer headwinds from episodic transaction activity.
Turning to Branded Cards, revenues were roughly flat versus the prior year, including the impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio as well as partnership terms that went into effect in 2018.
Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 6%, driven by organic loan growth, as well as the benefit of the acquisition of the L.L.Bean card portfolio.
In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 5% or 7% excluding the ongoing impact of the sale of our asset management business in the third quarter.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of a modest gain on the sale of a merchant acquiring business in the prior year.
Excluding the gain, card revenues grew 3% year-over-year on continued growth in loans and purchase sales.
And excluding investment revenues, our underlying Asia Consumer growth remained broadly in line with our medium-term expectations driven by growth in loans and deposits.
In total, operating expenses were up 1% in the fourth quarter, as investment spending and volume driven growth was largely offset by efficiency savings.
Turning now the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8, revenues of $8.2 billion were down 1% in the fourth quarter as strength in our accrual businesses as well as revenue growth in M&A and Equity Markets were more than offset by weakness in Fixed Income.
Total banking revenues of $5 billion grew 5%, Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 7% as reported and 11% in constant dollars, reflecting continued growth in transaction volumes and deposits as well as improved spreads.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.3 billion were down 1% from last year, as strong M&A performance was more than offset by a decline in underwriting, reflecting lower market activity.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.1 billion declined 11% in the fourth quarter.
Fixed Income revenues of $1.9 billion declined 21% year-over-year due to a challenging trading environment during the quarter.
Looking at the full year, excluding the previously mentioned gain of roughly $580 million in 2017, both revenues and expenses grew by 3% in 2018.
The combined strong performance in these businesses helped to offset weakness in Investment Banking and Fixed Income, down 7% and 6% respectively on a full year basis.
And pre-tax income was $44 million this quarter, better than our outlook, reflecting episodic gains in our investment portfolio as well as lower total expenses relative to our prior expectations.
As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.9 billion this quarter grew roughly 8% from last year in constant dollars as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue as well as the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.
On a full year basis, core accrual revenue grew by more than $4 billion over 2017, ahead of our outlook of $3.7 billion for the year with about $1 billion coming from the benefit of higher interest rates.
So, on a net basis, we expect to generate as much or even more than the $2 billion of growth in net interest revenue that we saw in 2018, even if we see less incremental benefit from rate hikes.
Of course, in 2018, this growth in net interest revenue was partially offset by a roughly $1 billion decline in non-interest revenues, driven by a drag from partnership renewal terms and lower mortgage revenues in Consumer, the wind-down of legacy assets, the impact of gains we took in 2017 on hedging activity in Corporate Treasury and the net impact of previously mentioned one-time gains on asset sales.
In the fourth quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 6% year-over-year to $63.79 driven by the lower share count and our CET1 Capital ratio improved to 11.9% driven by a reduction in risk-weighted assets, as we continued to prudently manage the balance sheet.
We also recognize that weÂre in an uncertain macro environment where the market is beginning to discount future growth and this may create a more volatile operating environment as we saw in the fourth quarter.
And while are US Branded Cards franchise generated only 1% growth for the full year, we saw 3% underlying growth in that franchise in 2018 with momentum as we exited the fourth quarter.
ThatÂs a business with nearly $9 billion of annual revenues, where we are now realizing the benefits of our investments over the past three years.
Of course, itÂs more difficult to predict the operating environment in areas like trading and investment banking but we continued to show good progress in M&A and equities this year, and our global FX business proved to be resilient in a challenging market.
As we look to 2019, weÂre preparing for a range of operating environments with a focus on achieving our RoTCE target of 12% this year in a responsible sustainable way.
From a revenue perspective, in addition to the good momentum weÂre seeing in many of our businesses, we also have other revenue tailwinds, including the absence of the FDIC surcharge, as well as a smaller expected drag from the wind-down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
I think that's a big sort of concern in the marketplace given the revenue backdrop at least in the fourth quarter that can change quickly in capital markets and I appreciate the commitment to the RoTCE.
But more importantly to your question around expense ranges we can manage to, you can look at the fourth quarter of 2018 and see we ran at about 41.8.
I mean if you -- the Branded Cards as John mentioned, fourth quarter roughly 3% underlying, and that's a -- we think of that as a pretty good run rate going into 2019.
And I think the -- what's clearly in the fourth quarter overshadowed that was really market fears over what the transition from QE to QT might look and feel like.
So if you go back and you look at the last page or so that John talked about, when you look at underlying growth in the business, if you look at -- John talked about the $9 billion of TTS revenue growing at 11%, we talked about Securities Services, the Private Bank lending, Mexico, US Branded Cards, equities, M&A, if you just take those revenues and add them up, you're in excess of 50% of the revenue of the firm.
And so again, when you think about things that are top of list, clearly, the more broad investment in terms of digital, we talked about some of those cost saves that have begun to come through roughly the $200 million this year, manifesting itself in $500 million to $600 million incremental in each of the next two years, a lot of that savings is dependent upon the continued investment in terms of the switch from analog to digital, and in particular in parts of our consumer business, coming from behind and kind of getting cards back on track, the empty calories of cutting marketing investment in terms of our platforms there, the investments that weÂve started and have been executing against in terms of Mexico.
But, in the environment as we sit, we're going to do the appropriate things of making sure that we continue to push ourselves on the expense front, at the same time knowing that we've got to create our own capacity to invest.
And again, as we grow -- as we saw the fourth quarter come down in revenues, we were able to bring our risk-weighted assets down as well.
But, we do have to keep in mind that our reported growth for noninterest revenue will look a little bit lower than the underlying because of a number of one-timers including the wind down of legacy assets and things like the Hilton gain and the Visa B share gains et cetera.
So, I think the way you can think about it is that the bulk of the reported growth that we'd expect to see next year would come in the NII line, but we would not see the decline in noninterest revenue and perhaps even see some upside there.
And that was one of the things that led us then to talk about trading revenues overall being down slightly year-over-year because we didn't see that good engagement in G10 rates.
And I think, look, Marty, what you saw in particular in the later stages of the fourth quarter and you could see it manifest when you look at fund returns for the quarter, where people went from in some cases having pretty reasonable years to actually having down years, we really saw kind of a mindset that manifested itself in similar ways for those people that managed to get there and be up.
I just think about the net interest rate, the net interest revenue outlook that we just talked about, and all of the growth now that is coming out of those businesses, youÂve seen the core accrual revenue grow $4 billion year-over-year.
I think, when we put together the targets, it reflected where we thought weÂd see the opportunity, so continued momentum out of Mexico, momentum out of Asia albeit, as John has described, weÂre seeing some pressure in the retail banking part of the business, particularly invest in investments.
But at this point in time, IÂd say that mix that weÂve talked about then in terms of needing to close the gap on the consumer side and 100 basis points or so of improvement on the ICG side is still where we think things are heading.
I guess the final point IÂd make on that as is as you saw in the fourth quarter, where we see pressure in the business I saw pressure in fixed income in particular, you'll see us manage the balance sheet.
But since you missed revenue growth this year, youÂre really kind of looking at now in the 4% [ph] in the next two years to still stay at a 3% for the full time period.
So, when you look at that, as we've described that at Investor Day, Brian, we talked about a number of levers, right, that it was the combination of single-digit revenue growth, good expense discipline, reasonable cost to credit, and obviously significant capital return.
So, I mean, look, in the past, in 2017, we talked about roughly $100 million benefit per quarter for 25 basis-point Fed rate hike.
I think if you take a look at it on a full-year basis, thatÂs a much better gauge of what you're doing in a business because you're going to have quarters like this where you have a slight decline in the retail revenues.
Today, we are joining by CitiÂs Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; the Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach; and CitiÂs incoming CFO, Mark Mason.
Hey. Our effective tax rate was 21% for the quarter, reflecting an adjustment to our full year estimate of income taxes under the new tax regime as well as other resulting actions we have taken.
Now, looking at full year results on Slide 4, we made steady progress in 2018, although revenue growth remained somewhat below our medium-term outlook.
This is primarily driven by the near-term impact of weaker market sentiment on our Asia wealth management revenues; the impact of partnership terms that came into effect in 2018 in US Branded Cards, which we have now lapped as we go into 2019; and finally, in US Retail, a drag from lower US Mortgage revenues which should abate going forward as well as rising deposit sensitivity.
These results largely reflect the macro uncertainty seen in the fourth quarter, which created a challenging trading environment as well as an industry-wide slowdown in underwriting activity.
If you look at 2018 versus 2017, we more than doubled our net new money inflows across consumer deposits and investments this year.
Average loans grew 3% versus last year, including 9% growth in interest earning balances as recent vintages continued to mature and we saw strong balance retention across our portfolio.
As such, we expect to remain broadly around this level of spreads going forward, although we will see quarterly fluctuations and actual performance will depend on a number of factors, including our acquisition mix, the rate environment and our balance between proprietary and co-brand portfolios over time.
As weÂve now lapped the impact of partnership renewals on our fee income and weÂre growing loan volumes at more attractive spreads.
Card revenues grew 8% on continued strength in purchase sales and loan growth, while retail banking revenues grew 6% excluding the impact of the asset management sale.
While investment revenues remained under pressure, we continued to see positive inflows into assets under management as well as 8% growth in Citigold Client.
Total average loan growth of 3% in Asia includes the impact of our continued repositioning away from lower return mortgage assets.
Private Bank revenues of $797 million grew 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in loans and investments as well as improved deposit spreads and Corporate Lending revenues of $559 million were up 9%, reflecting loan growth along with lower hedging costs.
At the Goldman Conference in early December, I noted that while clients remained engaged, we did not see the level of transaction activity we had originally expected this quarter in G10 rates in particular, as clients had largely stayed on the sidelines in an uncertain macro environment.
Securities Services grew 11%, as we continued to deepen client relationships while also benefiting from the higher rate environment.
And in Fixed Income, if you look at our total G10 FX and local markets rates and currencies business, revenues were far more stable at roughly flat to last year as we benefited from steady corporate flow activity across our global network.
Core accrual net interest revenue grew by $1.4 billion year-over-year, well above our prior expectations driven by the FDIC surcharge benefit, improved spreads in our US Branded Cards business and balance sheet optimization as we deployed more cash into better yielding assets.
The remaining 8 basis points reflect momentum weÂve seen building over the second half of the year, given higher interest rates, continued loan growth and an improved loan mix.
As we noted last quarter, even though core accrual net interest revenues grew sequentially from the second to the third quarter of 2018, our net interest margin remained flat at 360 basis points as the benefits of higher rates and loan growth were offset by higher average cash balances during the quarter.
We maintained our credit discipline growing our loan portfolio, while maintaining loss rates that were well within our medium-term expectations across every business and region.
Our other accrual businesses in ICG across Securities Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank generated another $8 billion of revenues with good line of sight into 2019.
Our Mexico Consumer franchise with nearly $6 billion of revenues continued to grow with a favorable market backdrop, including record low unemployment and strong consumer confidence.
John you mentioned feeling good about the momentum continuing on the NII front which was very solid this quarter and better fees as your lap the partnership headwind.
Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
What IÂd say is we see is we actually see a -- certainly US and even more broad global economy where the underlying fundamentals in particular on a domestic economy basis if you go around the world comprise of strong tight labor markets, reasonable wage increases, good consumption, while investment coming down, still reasonable.
And beyond that upfront impact and acceleration of store closures would likely have an impact on the Retail Services revenues, perhaps resulting to a flat top-line result in total for '19 and '20 given the expected impact of new account acquisitions.
Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
IÂd say that in -- especially in the second half of this year, weÂve seen flows -- overall flows in our consumer retail deposits -- excluding commercial deposits that pretty much have normalized now.
With December, we saw basically that extreme volatility given the overall lack of a view of where rates would finally bottom out just impact every one of our businesses in fixed income.
So, yes, equities were down a little bit more than debt, but you're still talking about some pretty significant drop-offs in market wallets, fourth quarter Â18 compared to fourth quarter 2017.
Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Hi. John, I can't believe we can't ask you questions on the call next quarter.
Yes. I know weÂve talked through a lot of high yield spread credit widening and how that's not really impacting you much.
Well, the deposit betas are likely -- certainly on the retail side, they're likely to continue to increase into Â19 even if there are no further rate hikes.
Most investors -- just a quick follow-up question are investing -- are expecting that the Fed will not raise rates anymore in 2019.
But if I look at, John, full-year Â18 ex the gain on the sale of asset management business, is it essentially revenue growth and expense growth or -- given your rounded numbers in constant dollars are essentially the same, so that would say no positive offering leverage?
",44.51,0.5492508
CITI,q1,2019,"We grow our operating margin by 8% and credit costs remain broadly in line with our expectations driving double digit EBIT growth.
We saw deposit growth in retail banking and introduced new products to support our branch light digital heavy strategy in the U.S. Our institutional clients group also performed well.
We also had a 20% increase in investment banking where we have steadily been gaining share among our target clients.
Fixed income did rebound from the fourth quarter with modest year-over-year growth while equities was impacted by a weaker environment.
As you know, we pride ourselves on having a deep bench, and last week we called on that depth when we selected new leadership who helped drive our firm forward in light of Jamie Forese's retirement.
Turning now to each business, Slide 4 shows the results for Global Consumer banking in constant dollars.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 2% driven by modest deposit growth and spread expansion.
We also launched a new digital lending product, Flex loan that allows eligible cardholders to convert a portion of their credit line into a fixed rate personal loan, leveraging our experience in Asia.
This will also initially be targeted to eligible card customers outside our core retail markets.
Retail loan growth was muted in Mexico again this quarter, driven by a slowdown in activity in our commercial banking franchise, where client sentiment has become more cautious under the new administration.
Excluding investment revenues, our underlying Asia consumer growth remains broadly in line with our medium term expectations.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 6% as reported, and 10% in constant dollars reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit and trade spreads.
Fixed income revenues of $3.5 billion grew 1% year-over-year as strengthened rates and spread products was partially offset by weakness in FX given the low currency volatility seen this quarter while corporate client activity remained stable.
Equities revenues were down 24% versus a particularly strong quarter in the prior year reflecting lower market volumes and client financing balances.
Total non-accrual loans increased sequentially this quarter, but the ratio of non-accrual to total corporate loans remained low at 41 basis points.
And the addition to non-accrual this quarter did not negatively impact our cost of credit as these loans were covered by previously established reserves.
And our NIM expanded by 1 basis point reflecting higher rates and improved loan mix.
And our CET1 capital ratio was stable sequentially at 11.9%, as net income was offset by $5.1 billion of total common share buybacks and dividends.
We face fewer headwinds in areas like Asia consumer, equities and the private bank, which presented difficult comparisons for us this quarter.
Yes. Branded Cards ex Hilton grew 5%.
Maybe just, Mark, quick question on rate sensitivity.
Maybe just one follow-up on Asia consumer accounts both card and retail banking accounts have been -- were pretty flat.
Yes. IÂll make two points on Asia consumer.
Yes. IÂm not giving any additional guidance at this point in time beyond whatÂs out there.
Yes. ThereÂs some revenue difference.
Thanks for taking my questions, Mark.
Yes. Mark Mason
Yes. Our G10 rate outperformed, driven really by strong client activity in North America.
We had positive operating leverage and improved our efficiency for the tenth straight quarter and we had strong growth in both loans and deposits in our core businesses.
In our global consumer bank, we had underlying revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region, excluding the Hilton gain last year, total revenues grew 4% on flat expenses.
In Mexico, we had 5% underlying growth, and while Asia grew at a slower rate due to a very strong prior year, investment revenues, loan and deposit growth remain solid.
Starting on Slide 3, net income of $4.7 billion in the first quarter grew 2% from last year, as a reduction in expenses, and a lower tax rate more than offset lower revenues as well as higher credit costs.
Revenues of $18.6 billion declined 2% from the prior year and were down 1% excluding $150 million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio last year, primarily reflecting lower equity markets revenues, and mark-to-market losses on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio, along with the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.
Expenses declined by 3% year-over-year as continued investments in the franchise were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, resulting in our 10th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage, and cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning while overall credit quality remained stable.
Excluding the previously mentioned gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses remained flat; resulting in positive operating leverage and an 8% improvement in operating margin, and pre-tax earnings grew 11%.
This growth and interest earning balances drove an improvement in our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans for NIR percent to 912 basis points this quarter.
Since that time, we have optimized our mix of interest earning, to non-interest earning balances, while continuing to drive account growth, and we expect loan growth to revert to more recent levels starting in the second quarter.
Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 3% driven by organic loan growth, as well as the impact of the L.L. We continue to drive transaction volumes for lower cost channels, and digital engagement remains strong with 12% growth in mobile users year-over-year.
In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 6% or 5% on an underlying basis excluding the impact of the sale of our asset management business last year.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the first quarter as growth in deposit, lending and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues.
While investment revenues remained under pressure in the first quarter, we continued to see positive flow into assets under management, as well as 10% year-over-year growth in Citigold clients.
In total, operating expenses were down 1% for the first quarter as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume driven growth.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8, revenues of $9.7 billion declined 2% in the first quarter, as strengthened TTS and investment banking was more than offset by weakness in equities, as well as the impact of $230 million of mark-to-market losses on loan hedges as credit spreads tightened throughout the quarter.
Private Bank revenues of $880 million declined 3% versus a strong quarter in the prior year reflecting lower managed investment revenues as well as higher funding cost, and corporate lending revenues of $569 million were up 9% reflecting growth in volumes and spreads.
Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion decline 1% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investments and volume driven growth, and cost of credit was $21 million this quarter driven by portfolio growth, partially offset by loan specific reserve releases.
In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.8 billion this quarter grew by roughly $860 million year-over-year, reflecting higher rates, loan growth and a favorable loan mix as well as the absence of the FDIC surcharge.
On a full year basis, we continue to expect to generate at least $2 billion of growth and net interest revenue year-over-year.
For the full year, we continue to expect modest revenue growth, flattish expenses, and higher but manageable cost of credit, combined with continued balance sheet and capital optimization to drive improved returns for our shareholders.
Looking to the second quarter, we expect to return to year-over-year revenue growth.
And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our core businesses, across TTS, security services, corporate lending and the private bank as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network.
And in Mexico, year-over-year revenue growth will likely be muted given strong growth and performance in the second quarter of last year, although we expect continued growth in pre-tax earnings.
For the full year as I mentioned, we are looking for some top line revenue growth for total Citi and expenses that would be roughly flattish to what we'd seen in the prior year.
That will obviously result in improved operating efficiency versus last year, but probably equally important, certainly equally important, we are managing those other levers whether it be the cost of credit or capital to ensure that weÂre getting to that RoTCE of 12%, and that would stay on our trajectory to get to 13.5 plus in the outer years.
What's involved with that to the other part of your question is continued momentum, continued growth in the accrual businesses that we have that I mentioned earlier, TTS Security Services, Private Bank et cetera, continued strength in our consumer franchise which grew globally at 4% this year, but U.S. We expect that growth to continue, and continue strengthening NIR line percentage for the Branded Cards business.
On the expense line, we will as mentioned last quarter, see the benefit of our productivity outweigh the investments that weÂre making and that should generate another $500 to $600 million over the course of 2019, that will be available to either fund expenses related to volume growth and certainly contribute to the overall performance metrics that we mentioned.
I think Glenn, what weÂve talked about and I think what Mark pointed out in his remarks is we think weÂve got the ability to manage the cost lines there and to manage both EBIT growth as well as returns.
I think weÂre starting to see the ability to pull the levers on positive operating leverage and sustainability of that, at the same time through some of the other things, weÂve done optimization et cetera not only drive EBITDA, drive net income, but also drive returns.
So I think if we saw growth rates continue to slow a bit, I think weÂve got the ability to manage through that and continue to still get the growth we want there at the bottom line in returns.
And if I could follow-up on John's and your answer on his card question; offering card customers tailored rewards to bring in banking business, happen to be a big fan of that, but I think it's getting a little active where you and a couple other big players are doing that.
And so, we think weÂre showing good sign for when that market does return in terms of the broader market activity to capture some of that upside given the account growth and given the investment AUMs weÂve been growing.
I think as youÂve seen our ability to drive leading performance in terms of operating efficiency, but if it comes down to the choice of not being able to make an investment in an area that we view as critical or accretive or something its offering real opportunity versus hitting the target I think our shareholders have been very clear certainly to me and to Mark that they would want us to make that investment.
I think the tax rate certainly, we came in lower this quarter, but we talked about that being at about 23% for the full year.
So, retail banking for North America, we started to see I think some good growth this quarter particularly if you exclude mortgages.
As I mentioned weÂre seeing deposit growth there that's going to help on the revenue line and we expect that to continue as we execute against that strategy.
I donÂt think thereÂs anything in particular in the way of expenses except, what I would say is that the productivity that weÂve talked about is going to start and will continue to play out through the balance of the year, and so that's going to help when you look at kind of the retail banking profitability in the outer quarters.
So, to be clear we do expect to see revenue growth through the balance of the year, and so that obviously will drive some expense dollars with that.
So the combination of those two things combined with what we're seeing in the way of growth in our business and/or opportunities that we think makes sense to invest will get us to kind of a core number in terms of what would be available for us to return to shareholders.

CITI,q2,2019,"In North America, that was led by continued strong performance in branded cards, and again, we saw encouraging momentum in deposit growth, which accelerated from the first quarter; and internationally, net income was up 25%.
In our Institutional Clients Group, we delivered continued growth overall in our steadier transaction and accrual-type businesses showing the strength of our global client network, while we saw pressure in our market-sensitive businesses reflecting the broader industry even in products like Investment Banking, where we continued to gain share.
That said, there remains uncertainty with respect to the economic market and rate environment, but as we think -- I think, we've shown that our franchise can manage through these by focusing on the things that we can control.
Revenues of $18.8 billion grew 2% from the prior year, reflecting the Tradeweb gain, as well as solid results in consumer and overall growth in our accrual businesses in ICG.
Expenses declined 2% year-over-year as volume growth along with continued investments in the franchise were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets, resulting in our 11th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage.
In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $689 billion, as 4% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind-down of legacy assets, and deposits grew 5% with contribution from both our consumer and institutional franchises.
Looking at results for the first half of 2019, we saw continued momentum in consumer, as well as the accrual businesses in ICG, which helped to offset the headwinds of lower market-sensitive revenues, along with the continued wind-down of legacy assets.
In total, operating expenses were down 1% in the second quarter, as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume-driven growth and cost of credit was down 3% reflecting a smaller LLR build relative to the prior year.
Turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 8, revenues of $9.7 billion were roughly flat in the second quarter and down 3% excluding the Tradeweb gain, as continued momentum in the accrual businesses was more than offset by lower market-sensitive revenues and the negative impact from mark-to-market losses on loan hedges as credit spreads further tightened in the quarter.
Looking at the first half of the year in ICG, our operating margin improved by 1% as solid contributions from our growing higher returning network businesses, most notably TTS and Securities Services, were largely offset by the decline in our market-sensitive business.
We are investing in technology to further digitize and improve our on-boarding processes, enhance our client-facing platforms, and roll out new capabilities across the franchise as we support the growth in cross-border flows that we are seeing with our multi-national clients, and we have a strong pipeline of initiatives going forward.
In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of nearly $12 billion this quarter grew by roughly $450 million year-over-year, reflecting higher rates, loan growth and a favorable loan mix, as well as higher trading-related NIR, along with the absence of the FDIC surcharge.
However, net interest margin declined five basis points sequentially, as the benefit of our revenues was more than offset by higher cash balances, reflecting strong deposit growth in the quarter.
We continue to estimate that each 25 basis point cut in U.S. rates impacts revenues by roughly $50 million on a quarterly basis, but, of course, this will depend on the competitive environment for deposits and other factors.
So, the rate environment continues to evolve, but we are managing our rate sensitivity carefully, and we continue to expect to generate net interest revenue growth this year of about 4% in constant dollars, which equates to roughly $2 billion of growth as we've discussed on previous earnings calls.
In the second quarter, while we saw pressure in underlying markets revenues, it was entirely offset by the Tradeweb gain, so non-interest revenues were flat to last year.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2019, as a reminder, in consumer, we will be comparing to the third quarter of 2018 when we had a $250 million gain on the sale of our asset management business in Mexico.
However, we should be able to more than offset this headwind with organic growth across the rest of our accrual and consumer businesses, and we should see a favorable comparison in markets revenues in the fourth quarter, even if investor client activity remains muted, similar to what we've seen so far this year.
From a revenue perspective, we are seeing solid momentum across the consumer franchise and continued growth in our accrual businesses in ICG.
Looking ahead, we will maintain this expense discipline relative to the revenue environment, while continuing to make essential investments in the franchise, including investments in infrastructure and controls, but we do expect expenses to be lower on a sequential basis from the first half to the second half of the year.
In ICG, we expect continued year-over-year growth in our accrual businesses as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network and markets and investment banking revenues should reflect the overall market environment.
As we think about levers to kind of keep that up in the second half and push over the goal line to get above 12% for the year, second half often has not as strong capital markets, obviously, haven't been so good this quarter -- so far this year.
The good news is that we have seen continued momentum in the consumer franchise, particularly in branded cards as we've talked about over the past couple of quarters with very strong performance this quarter as well on the heels of us converting those promotional balances to more average interest earning balances.
You heard me mention, the international franchises which are growing to have continued growth in the balance of the year and where there's muted growth to have -- to offset that with expense management and therefore have EBIT growth particularly in the case of Latin America.
The big area where the uncertainty in the environment you can pick the factor, whether it's the direct -- what's going on with rates and volatility around that or trade and tariff discussions, it plays out through the market sensitive business.
I mean, when you look at the profitability just in general on the consumer business, it does tend to skew towards the back half of the year because of things like marketing spend.
So, if you look at the 12% decline in non-interest bearing deposits and the 9% increase in interest-bearing deposits and then also the seven basis point rise in deposit costs sequentially and then the drop in loan yields, those trends combined, while not surprising, you would think from the outside would be a more negative tone on NII, but I think your guide was actually pretty good.
And as we look at that, we've obviously factored in at this point not only the shift that you mentioned from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing, but also the likelihood of a rate reduction based on the talk that is out there.
And so as we look at -- and look at kind of the continued momentum on the card side, and we look at the end of the deposit growth that we're seeing particularly in the TTS franchise with higher volumes a growth of 10% or so, we feel pretty good about our ability to get to that 4% growth in NIR.
In terms of the pricing of the loan, that is -- both a by-product of what we're seeing in the market, on the way of competition from a pricing point of view and obviously -- and the funding cost that we have.
As we get greater clarity on those things, we will obviously continue to kind of look at that, but that remains the target going forward.
And the way we think about the return of capital distribution of capital going forward is, largely as we get close to that 11.5%, which we expect to get close to towards the end of the year will be around how much capital we generate just opposed against how much we need to continue to grow.
Its -- these things kind of take time to play out, I think as we've seen over the past couple of years.
But given just the $50 million impact for 20 -- for the quarter from 20 to 25 basis points of cut, presumably even if we do get one cut or two cuts, it seems like you're confident that you can get NII growth in the back end of the year versus the first half?
And one final one from me, a large portion of the expected profitability expansion in North America consumer comes from right-sizing the profitability in retail banking and you gave some positive commentary obviously and you feel pleased about the momentum in terms of deposits, the inflows, the digital strategies, tapping your cards network or your cards clients.
But you also have a lower rate environment and deposit spreads is likely going to come in and I think you didn't have any growth in revenues in retail banking.
And so, over time, I think it's going to be more challenging to look at just the retail banking portion of that we breakout in income, because of that broader client strategy.
In fact, what you heard me mention earlier in terms of one of the protected areas being infrastructure and control, they are coupled with the different ways to look at that protected area as we invest in technology around our infrastructure and improve the data quality that we have and things of that sort, not only does it help us run a safer and more sound organization, but it also arms us with information sooner to enable us to react and serve our clients more quickly.
We do see benefits from technology playing out in these -- in the expense line and in the productivity savings that are referenced both in 2019 and 2020 and likely beyond and those things will help in getting us to the lower levels of operating efficiency that we've talked about achieving over time.
You can also look at the first half of the year or the fourth quarter of last year and witness strength in the franchise, on the consumer side, on your core side of the business, but you can also witness the impact of the environment that we're in and the uncertainty around that.
Despite that uncertainty, we've gotten to 11.9% in the first half through pulling a number of levers and we would expect to continue to pull those levers into the back half of this year to the extent that that uncertainty increases, or there is more significant reaction from the market to the uncertainty, we'll of course look and work to find additional levers, but at some point that becomes challenged, in terms of getting to that 12% just given things we want to protect in this franchise.
We'll see how this year plays out, given all of the uncertainty referenced and we'll go into 2020 with the 13.5% remaining our target and with clarity on where we think we'll end up against it.
And I think from our perspective, we don't believe that the market has made that full adjustment, and there's probably some terms that's got to come as portfolio set-up for that potential lower rate environment.
The question is when will that come and to what degree will that come, will there -- will we get conviction in terms of the trajectory of this lower rate environment and portfolios have to reposition, because I think today, they're not positioned where they need to be fully.
Could you just give us a sense of how that was relative to expectations and what you think the major drivers were for generating that growth speaking to rate versus marketing versus any other factors that you want to add?
I would say, we would expect continued growth in the deposits in the back half of the year.
It is a combination of -- and if you think about our strategy again to target card customers, a good portion of the deposit growth that we achieved were outside of our six markets and with our card customers who did not have a retail banking relationship.
Some of it is rate, yes, but it's a combination of all of those things and we expect continued growth.
Again, we could very well see, as Mike suggested, the market having to react to a rate reduction and certainty around the direction in a way that is favorable to trading businesses, but we've got to, kind of, wait and see how some of that plays out.
And so investments or the digital capabilities that we invested in from technology point of view, the organizational business model structure that we put in place in terms of our retail activity there and all of those things are starting to play out as expected.
And then, we're tempering growth in terms of the loan activity, loan volume in light of what's going on in the economy and that obviously helps at least -- as we think about expected cost of credit and what else, so those are number of factors that play out there.
Today, we are joined by Citi's Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason.
On our call today our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first; then Mark Mason, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website citigroup.com.
We delivered positive operating leverage for the 11th straight quarter and improved our efficiency, while again growing loans and deposits.
Our $21.5 billion capital return will increase the three-year total to $62.3 billion and includes raising our dividend to $0.51 and continuing to buy back shares of common stock at roughly the same level as last year's plans.
Given the current environment and market conditions, we'll stay flexible with a focus on making steady progress towards our financial targets through client led growth and research discipline, including balance sheet, credit, and expenses.
Starting on slide three, net income of $4.8 billion in the second quarter grew 7% from last year, including a roughly $350 million pre-tax gain on our investment in Tradeweb, which benefited EPS by $0.12 per share.
And cost of credit increased, driven by volume growth and seasoning as well as a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio while overall credit quality remained stable.
Revenues grew 4% with contribution from all regions while expenses were up 1% driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings.
In digital, we further enhanced our account opening process and launched new products designed to deepen our client relationships, including relationship-based offers that leverage our proprietary banking and double cash rewards across both card and deposit products.
Results from our new digital lending product Flex Loan also continue to be positive, following its launch in January, as loan originations more than tripled from the first to the second quarter, while maintaining a strong credit profile.
Mortgage revenues were largely stable again this quarter on a sequential basis, but declined year-over-year mostly reflecting higher funding cost.
Client engagement remained strong with purchase sales up 8% and we continue to generate growth in interest-earning balances this quarter up about 10%.
Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 1%, driven by loan growth partially offset by higher contractual partner payments.
Total expenses for North America consumer were up 2% year-over-year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were largely offset by efficiency savings.
Net credit losses grew by 12% year-over-year reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios.
Our performance year-to-date is in line with our full NCL rate outlook for both branded cards and retail services at 300 to 325 basis points and 500 to 525 basis points respectively.
Second quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew 4%.
In Latin America total consumer revenues grew 3% or 5% on an underlying basis excluding the impact of the sale of our asset management business last year.
Treasury & Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 4% as reported and 7% in constant dollars with growth in deposits, transaction volumes and trade spreads reflecting continued strong client engagement.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 10% from last year, while outperforming the market wallet.
Private Bank revenues of $866 million were up 2%, reflecting growth with both new and existing clients, which drove higher lending, deposits, and AUM volumes, partially offset by spread compression.
And Corporate Lending revenues of $538 million were down 9%, reflecting lower spreads and higher hedging cost.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.7 billion were down 4% from last year, excluding the Tradeweb gain, as growth in Securities Services was more than offset by the decline in our markets businesses where the environment has been challenging and investor client activity has remained muted.
Excluding Tradeweb, Fixed Income revenues declined 4% year-over-year, reflecting the challenging trading environment particularly in rates.
Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion declined 2% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investments in volume-driven growth.
On a sequential basis, net interest revenue grew by roughly $230 million, largely reflecting higher trading-related NIR, along with one additional day in the quarter.
In the second quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 10% year-over-year to $67.64, driven by net income and a lower share count, and our CET1 capital ratio was stable sequentially at 11.9%, as net income was offset by $4.6 billion of total common share buybacks and dividends.
On an underlying basis, similar to the results seen so far this year, revenue growth will likely remain somewhat muted, although we expect continued strong growth in pre-tax earnings.
For total Citigroup, expenses should decline sequentially and cost of credit should continue to grow modestly year-over-year, reflecting volume growth and continued normalization in ICG.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
Hi. Interest-bearing deposit rates paid was up 7 basis points without any kind of a hike.
I think from a trade perspective, I would say -- I don't want to say BAU, the business activity remains fairly strong.
Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
So I guess what I'd say is obviously our fixed income revenues for the quarter were down about 4% if you exclude the gain from Tradeweb.
And can you maybe just speak to some of the unique aspects of the business like trading -- trade finance that should drive some lower loss levels through the cycle since that was actually pretty encouraging commentary from our point of view?
Yes. But when we look at that juxtaposed against the internal metrics that we use, whether that would be card usage patterns or utilization or payment rates or the percentage of customers making minimum payments.
Yes. But instead tied towards growth that we've had in both with multinational clients that are large and that we've been with for a long time, but also new emerging clients as they've entered into new markets, new countries and we've been there to assist them with how they kind of grow their businesses and operations in those new environments where whether it be working capital or supply chain needs that they've had.
Look, I mean, we -- obviously, the volatility around rate movement has been pretty significant over the past couple of quarters from us -- from an increase to now a reduction and possibly three reductions.
I think you dropped about 500 basis points, which was the lowest in maybe four or five years.

CITI,q3,2019,"Hello and welcome to Citi's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason.
Good morning and thank you all for joining us.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
Thank you, Liz and good morning everyone.
Deposit momentum continued with a strong contribution from both traditional and digital channels as we leveraged our brand and scale in credit cards to drive deeper, multiproduct relationships with our clients.
Our institutional clients group also had balanced performance with solid results in both the market-sensitive and accrual-type businesses.
Our share gains continued at Investment Banking, while our Markets performance showed resilience due to strong client engagement.
And cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning in consumer, while overall credit quality remained stable.
Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking in more detail.
Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 1% driven by organic loan growth.
Total expenses for North America consumer were down 2% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and higher volume related expenses.
Our NCL rate in U.S. Branded Cards and Retail Services were 312 basis points and 477 basis points, respectively, this quarter, consistently with our full year guidance.
We continue to see strong growth in our underlying wealth management drivers in Asia with 9% growth in Citigold clients and 7% growth in net new money versus last year.
In total, operating expenses were largely unchanged in the third quarter as efficiency savings offset investment spending and volume-driven growth.
Treasury & Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 6% as reported and 7% in constant dollars, as we continued to see strong client engagement and solid growth in transaction volumes, partially offset by spread compression.
Private Bank revenues of $867 million were up 2% driven by higher lending and deposit volumes as well as increased investment activity with both new and existing clients, partially offset by spread compression.
And Corporate Lending revenues of $527 million were down 6% reflecting lower spreads and higher hedging costs.
And credit quality remains strong, consistent with our target client strategy.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
But have you thought about how CECL in an environment where maybe things don't really deteriorate much where we don't have a big change of the macro backdrop towards the team, how CECL impacts your ongoing level of provisioning going forward and so just kind of maybe thinking through some of the puts and takes of that?
Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
As I think back over the last two to three years as rates were rising, higher funding costs were consistently highlighted as a drag on your liability-sensitive trading book.
Now with rates declining, we're really not seeing that benefit from lower funding costs on the way down and I was hoping you could help us unpack what's happening on the trading side.
But I guess thinking -- even taking a more holistic view, looking at principal transactions plus NII as the key trading proxy, it sounds like you should still see some benefit on the funding side over time as rates do come down.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Because it does feel like great brand value, maybe a little bit underlevered in the revenue line here; and so, I'm just wondering, do you build on that with incremental products like mortgage across these different geographies, kind of going back to where you were pre-crisis where you were much more nationwide and a much broader set of products?
Can you talk about just like what happens post 2019 in terms of your willingness to let the CET1 ratio continue to come down in the context of still seeing a big capital return number and given what the outlook is for earnings underneath?
We do we actually do expect I think I've mentioned the outlook for Corporate/Other being slightly higher going into the fourth quarter as a result of continued infrastructure costs.
And I think you've seen over the last three or four years, some pretty consistent market share gains for us there.
And your final question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
Starting on Slide 3, net income of $4.9 billion in the third quarter grew 6% from last year and EPS grew 20%, mostly driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding, as we've continued to buy back shares throughout the year, consistent with our capital plan.
Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 1% from the prior year and were up 2% excluding the roughly $250 million gain on the sale of our asset management business in Mexico last year, reflecting solid results across both our consumer and institutional businesses.
Expenses increased 1% year-over-year as volume growth, along with continued investments in the franchise were partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets.
In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 4% year-over-year to $692 billion, as 5% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind-down of legacy assets and deposits grew 9% with contributions from both our consumer and institutional franchises.
Revenues were up 3% on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of FX as well as the roughly $150 million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio in the first quarter of 2018 and the previously mentioned gain on the asset management business in Mexico.
On the institutional side, revenues are up 2% year-to-date with continued growth in our accrual businesses.
Expenses declined 1% year-to-date even as we continued to make critical investments in our franchise and underlying pretax earnings grew by 4%.
Excluding the gain last year, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses were down 1%, driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings.
And looking at year-to-date results in consumer, excluding both gains in 2018, we generated 4% revenue growth while expenses were roughly flat, resulting in 9% growth in operating margin and 12% growth in pretax earnings.
This growth in interest-earning balances drove a year-over-year improvement in our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans to 914 basis points this quarter.
But importantly, we are managing expenses carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns, as seen again this quarter in our strong EBIT growth year-over-year.
Revenues of $9.5 billion were up 3% in the third quarter, reflecting continued momentum in TTS and the Private Bank, combined with strong performance in Investment Banking and stability in fixed income markets, partially offset by softness in equity markets and corporate lending.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 4% from last year, outperforming the market wallet, reflecting continued strength in debt underwriting and strong performance in M&A, particularly in EMEA.
Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion increased 4% year-over-year, as investments, volume-driven growth and higher compensation costs were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Looking at year-to-date results in ICG, our operating margin improved by 1% as solid results in TTS and strength in Investment Banking were offset by the decline in Equity Markets' revenues.
As you can see, year-to-date net interest revenue grew by 4% or roughly $1.3 billion year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by 5% growth ex-Markets, reflecting strength in North America Branded Cards and TTS as well as the absence of the FDIC surcharge.
Looking at results for the quarter, net interest revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and declined by roughly $250 million sequentially, reflecting the impact of lower Markets' net interest revenue.
So, while we did see pressure in net interest revenues, driven by the dynamic seen this quarter in Markets, which could continue into the fourth quarter, in total for Citigroup, we remain comfortable in our ability to generate modest year-over-year revenue growth in 2019 on a reported basis, driven by net interest revenue growth of 2% to 3% in constant dollars for the full year below our original forecast, given the dynamic I just mentioned in Markets, but offset by higher noninterest revenue, which should be better than our original forecast of at least flat to 2018 on a full year basis.
In ICG, Markets and Investment Banking revenues should reflect the overall environment, but we are not anticipating a repeat of the challenging trading environment seen in the fourth quarter of last year.
And in our accrual businesses, revenues should benefit from continued strong client engagement and higher volumes.
In consumer, we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in all regions, driven by continued loan and deposit growth, partially offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads.
For total Citigroup, expenses should decline sequentially, cost of credit should continue to grow modestly, and importantly we expect solid pre-tax earnings growth year-over-year.
I think I heard your comment about where part of the relationship is coming in, and how you're growing in the bank on non-bank customers through the card portfolio, but just focus specifically around the 11% growth in Branded Cards, talk about balance transfer and how the box you're writing to?
We are, yeah, as we think about investments we've made in technology and our ability to mine the data that we have of our customers, we're able to create value propositions that they're likely to respond to and open-up a retail banking account with us.
Mark, just want to confirm, for 2019, still feeling good about 12% or a darn close to 12% for this year given your fourth quarter outlook.
It's a very different environment than I think we expected kind of coming into the year.
And we need to factor in the uncertainty that's in the environment, what that's likely to look like, or how that's likely to play out, what the impact Â the full year impact in 2020 of the rate reductions might be, what we think client demand is going to look like.
And so we really need to get through the budgeting process to both understand what we think that top line is likely to look like, understand what levers we have available to us to pull in order to continue to demonstrate progress, and see what we might be able to do to narrow that gap and deliver on our targets.
And I think as Mark alluded to, John, the other thing that I very much want to do is get the benefit of continuing to talk to our clients in terms of how they're thinking about things.
We want to continue to gain information from our clients, not just here in the U.S., but around the world in terms of how they're thinking about things.
And then lastly and you alluded to it, but it certainly played out in this quarter as well, as we've seen pressure on some of the wallets, and as we've thought about kind of the long-term -- or longer-term business model and benefits from technology that will play out, we've made some capacity adjustments.
So we think we -- look, I mean obviously in adjusting the capacity here, we're going to see some benefits of that play out in 2020.
But -- so the question is, growing revenue's faster than expenses, when you look back a bit ago, you were kind of doing it by like a touchdown or 2.
So one here, Mike, I think is if you go and you look at the numbers, I would say, relatively, quietly, as Mark alluded to over the past year, our head count was down by about 7,000, so somewhere between 3% and 4%.
I think clearly, technology, when you go back to slide 23 and look at our consumer business and some of the drivers around contact rates, digital mobile engagement, e-statement penetration, all of those moving, I think, very nicely in the right direction.
But just like last year's fourth quarter, when I know you were disappointed, what I don't want to commit to is in some environment, having to do things that don't make sense for the long-term.
So, what I mean by that is if you think about what we talked about in the way of capacity adjustments that we've had to make and the repositioning around that, those are increased expenses that we're having to take in the quarter and through the year.
But given what you know about your current rate sensitivity, what the forward curve is telling you right now where long rates are at, what you're seeing in the economy, how confident are you that some revenue is still the base case for 2020 -- some revenue growth target is still the base case for next year?
And I do -- I mean I do -- we do expect to see continued growth in our cards business.
And it seems like, you are growing in higher loss content lending in the U.S. Obviously, the composition of the balance of the portfolio in any given quarter is going to be an important factor in estimating what that impact will be.
So, I think -- look I think it's -- if you turn the page that page 11 kind of highlighted the mix that -- the dynamic that you're referencing and that I spoke to which is that, we're obviously seeing lower NIR on our -- from our Markets business that's completely -- that's being completely offset in markets non-NIR.
And while you're right, that we have talked about funding costs and its impact and there is a funding cost benefit that plays through as rates come down, the dynamic around the markets revenues is overshadowing that, if you will.
It depends on your definition of inorganic and so again, if we continue to find, as an example, portfolios of loans or cards or those types of things that we can acquire and fit from a client demography perspective, fit from a business line perspective and obviously are accretive to our returns, wide open to it.
And again, I think you've seen what we've done there in terms of on the consumer side, the institutional side, using the digital strategy to not just reinforce but continue to grow our franchise.
And just a follow-up to Glenn's question earlier, year-over-year growth in Branded Card revenues of 11%, you noted, Mark, that you're sort of at the right shift in terms of the mix in that portfolio.
And I think our ability to move with our clients in terms of what that means has us pretty well positioned out there and it something we're obviously wanting to make sure we're in the room and is part of.
And I think as Mark referenced in the numbers and some of the experiments that we've doing on the deposit site, our ability to grow outside of footprint of the deposits brought in not just in the quarter, but really year-to-date, 2/3 of those brought in outside of those six markets.
The only thing I'd add to your point around continued progress is if you look back to 2018 and we had a target of a 10.5% RoTCE, we were able to deliver on the 10.9%.
And we've been doing that over the past quarter or so as we've seen interest rates come down, and you should expect that we'll continue to do that to be aligned with the market.

CITI,q4,2019,"Today, weÂre joined by CitiÂs Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; the Chief Financial Officer -- and Mark Mason, CFO.
Good revenue growth paired with disciplined expense management allowed us to deliver positive operating leverage, even as we continue to make significant investments in the franchise.
Both North America and international consumer banking had 4% year-over-year revenue growth.
Treasury and Trade Solutions continued to grow, despite a lower rate environment as we work to ensure our global network remains indispensable to our multinational clients.
Now, let me turn it over to Mark and then weÂd be happy to answer your questions.
In Global Consumer Banking, we generated 4% revenue growth across all three regions.
Slide five shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
Slide six shows the results for North America Consumer Banking in more detail.
Total expenses for North America consumer were down 4% year-over-year as efficiency savings, more than offset investment spending and higher volume related expenses.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were up 6% from last year, outperforming the market wallet, reflecting strong performance in equity and debt underwriting, particularly investment-grade underwriting as we leveraged our global capabilities to help clients optimize their funding needs.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.9 billion were up 28% from last year.
And credit costs increased to $246 million, reflecting overall volume growth as well as a few episodic downgrades while overall portfolio quality remains strong.
The combined solid performance in these businesses helped to more than offset weakness in equities and deliver positive operating leverage for the year.
Revenues of $542 million increased 8% from last year, reflecting gains on investments partially offset by the wind down of legacy assets.
[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous.
Well, let me -- Mark, why donÂt I start and maybe just talk a little bit about the revenue environment and what may drive.
The next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
WeÂll go into a fair bit of this in detail at our Investor Day. YouÂve asked a question before in data centers.
The next question will come from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
Do you think continued improvement could be realized from here, if we keep the rate curve fairly flat and thereÂs no major change in the global economic outlook?
The next question will come from Matt OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
And the benefits that those clients are realizing as we invest in technologies that bring those product capabilities together to create solutions that allow them to run their operations more efficiently, and so more traction there would be a second thing that you would look to I think.
When I look at your revenue growth of 2019 as a starting point, you had about $1 billion improvement [Technical Difficulty] when I see that was about 2%.
So, what do you do -- what can you do tangibly now differently to really get that revenue growth going again, because full year Â19 was -- youÂre at the lower end of where youÂve been in the last five years?
Yes. But, it seems like weÂre coming in somewhere about flat to market wallet where we had the past several years taken share.
The final question is a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Yes. WeÂre gearing up for Investor Day. Mike Mayo
We ended the year in a strong capital position with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.7%, and weÂre on track to deliver our Investor Day commitment of returning more than $60 billion of capital to our shareholders over three CCAR cycles, having returned over $22 billion in 2019 alone.
Starting on Slide three, net income of $5 billion in the fourth quarter grew 18% from last year, as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate.
Revenues of $18.4 billion grew 7% from the prior year, driven by higher noninterest revenue and reflecting continued solid results across consumer as well as our accrual businesses in ICG, along with a rebound in markets.
Expenses increased 6% year-over-year, reflecting higher compensation and volume-related expenses, along with continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets.
In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $699 billion as 3% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind down of legacy assets, and deposits grew 6% with contributions from both our consumer and institutional franchises.
Looking at 2019, our progress was broad-based with revenue growth, positive operating leverage, and operating margin expansion across both our consumer and institutional businesses.
And even as weÂve continued to make critical investments in our franchise, we maintained expense discipline delivering roughly flat expenses for the year, in line with our outlook.
For the quarter, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses were down 1%, driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings.
And looking at full year results in consumer, excluding both gains in 2018, we also generated 4% revenue growth while expenses were roughly flat, resulting in 9% growth in operating margin and 13% growth in pretax earnings.
Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion were up 1% year-over-year, with continued growth in loans and purchase sales across the majority of the portfolio.
In total, operating expenses for International Consumer Banking increased 3% in the fourth quarter as investment spending and volume-driven growth was partially offset by efficiency savings, and cost of credit was down 6%, driven primarily by Mexico.
Revenues of $9.4 billion were up 10% in the fourth quarter, reflecting continued momentum in the accrual businesses as well as strong performance in both Investment Banking and Fixed Income markets, partially offset by softness in equity markets.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.6 billion were up 2% as reported, and 3% in constant dollars, as we drove strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits and transaction volumes, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates.
Private Bank revenues of $847 million were up 6%, driven by higher lending and increased investment activity with both new and existing clients, partially offset by spread compression, and corporate lending revenues of $732 million were roughly flat as growth in the commercial book was offset by lower volumes in the rest of the portfolio.
Fixed Income revenues were up 49%, largely reflecting a recovery from the fourth quarter 2018, coupled with strong performance, particularly in rates and spread products.
For full year 2019, our net income grew 3%, on the combination of revenue growth, positive operating leverage, continued credit discipline, and a lower tax rate.
From a client perspective, our revenue growth was largely driven by continued strong engagement with our corporate clients across TTS and Investment Banking, as well as both Fixed Income and equity markets.
And looking at our results from a product perspective, we generated over half our revenues in banking, which grew 3% as reported and 5% in constant dollars on continued momentum in TTS, Investment Banking and the Private Bank.
Looking ahead for 2020, we would expect a quarterly pre-tax loss of roughly $250 million in Corporate/Other as we continue to invest in infrastructure and controls and see some impact from lower rates, as well as a reduced level of gains.
As you can see, we delivered 3% growth in net interest revenue or roughly $1.4 billion year-over-year in constant dollars in 2019, in line with the high end of our latest outlook, mainly reflecting strength in North America Branded Cards and TTS.
Looking at results for the quarter, we saw a rebound in markets, net interest revenues, both year-over-year and sequentially, while growth in the rest of the franchise was more than offset by the headwinds of lower rates.
Looking ahead to 2020, we do expect to deliver some growth in net interest revenues this year, despite the change in the direction of rates as loan growth and mix become the primary drivers, and we remain comfortable in our ability to deliver continued growth in noninterest revenues this year, driven by continued fee growth across both our consumer and institutional businesses.
As Mike mentioned, the revenue environment has changed since we set our targets for 2020 with lower interest rates, slower global growth and the pressure weÂve seen in industry wallets in markets and banking.
So, we expect we will continue to make progress in improving our returns, and we look forward to having the opportunity to talk more about this year and beyond at our Investor Day in May. With that Mike and I are happy to take any questions.
So, weÂve seen good deposit growth, as you said through the year in both our consumer business as well as on the institutional side, and that in many ways I think is an important proof point around our consumer strategy.
That said, weÂve delivered on the 1% weÂve talked about as guidance for the revenue growth for the quarter and I think itÂs 2% for the full year.
So, look, I think itÂs -- if you think about what we saw this year and some of the key important drivers of performance, you can kind of look across many of the businesses and see good top-line growth underlying and good EBIT performance.
And the combination of that and continued work on the cost of credit, and of course, weÂll continue to look at the tax line, but we believe the combination of that focus and continued productivity benefits funding the volume growth that we expect to have will get us to the range of the 12 to 13 that I referenced.
So, is it some unusual items in the back half of the year, accelerated spending that you expect to slow, or if we see a higher revenue growth, is that going to be offset by volume-related expenses and you just canÂt get a ton of operating leverage.
With that said, there are a couple of things that are playing through that that I think will benefit the expense line in 2020, and cover any volume-related increases or investments that weÂre planning to make.
And particularly, if you look at the ICG in the last quarter, you got to kind of keep in mind that that growth in expenses is 10% topline growth, 8% expense growth but that comes with the compensation increase associated with those revenues, the volume increases associated with that activity that we saw in the back half of the year.
Mike, does the 12% to 13% RoTCE for this year fully capture the potential of the franchise or -- and I expect you to give us more detail on Investor Day. Again, weÂve kind of talked about the steps along the way.
And we think weÂve got the ability using technology, client engagement, wallet share gains, a lot of the levers that weÂve spoken to on the revenue and expense side of continuing to make improvement and make progress against those benchmarks.
I think, as we look at things that weÂve done, youÂve seen us adjusting in particular front end capacity against the business, in particular in terms of cash, making investments in Delta One derivatives prime broker.
So, the dynamic, it kind of move away from just capital is being the driver to actually now the fundamentals of the business starting to perk up a little bit going into this next Investor Day. But, I think as we look towards the future I think one is that our levels of client engagement and what youÂve seen since Investor Day, we talked about revenue gains coming off of kind of potential wallet expansion, but in particular market share gains.
And I would expect at Investor Day, we are going to talk more about that as the things we do, I think continue to resonate with the clients, as the investments that weÂve made in our products, the investments that weÂve made in service, I think continue to reap good benefits.
If weÂre just talking on this call a year from now and you guys have better-than-expected than modest total revenue growth, what are some of the data points do you think we need to look at throughout the year where the revenue growth could come in stronger?
The second category is, as I think about our global corporate client in our Institutional Clients Group, and the continued great engagement that weÂre seeing with those clients, not just in -- in TTS around the world, not just existing clients, but new clients that weÂve been able to onboard and grow with very rapidly, not just cash management products, but also with capital markets offerings, like our FX capabilities.

CITI,q1,2020,"Our accrual businesses reflect the impact of the three US rate cuts seen last year, as well as some impact from additional cuts seen this quarter in response to the crisis, with an expectation for a more pronounced impact going forward.
Additionally, we had over $800 billion in available liquidity to help support our clients, and including the $4.1 billion transition impact as we adopted CECL at the beginning of the year, as well as the additional reserves taken this quarter, credit reserves stand at roughly $23 billion with a reserve ratio of 2.9% on funded loans.
Total credit costs of $4.8 billion were up significantly from last year, including a reserve build of approximately $2.8 billion, primarily related to the impact of changes in our economic outlook.
So in total, we grew a purchase sale of 3% in branded cards in the first quarter, but the trend line over the past month would indicate a significant decline in purchase activity in the second quarter, which is expected to impact loan growth.
And while we havenÂt yet seen the full impact from COVID-19 in Mexico, we did see a slowdown in purchase sales in March, which is expected to continue as customer behavior will likely follow the pattern weÂve seen in other regions.
In total, operating expenses for our international business were up 3% in the first quarter, driven by Mexico, reflecting investments as well as episodic items partially offset by efficiency savings and cost of credit increased to $939 million, primarily driven by the impact of changes in our economic outlook.
Revenues of $12.5 billion increased 25% in the first quarter, as strong performance in fixed income and equity markets as well as the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in TTS and corporate lending.
Treasury and Trade Solution revenues of $2.4 billion were down 5% as reported and 2% in constant dollars, as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates.
And while average loans were roughly flat, we did see a meaningful increase in end-of-period loans this quarter, reflecting the drawdowns and new facilities that I mentioned earlier, as we continue to support our clients.
Equities revenues of $1.2 billion were up 39% versus last year, reflecting a strong performance in derivatives, including an increase in client activity due to higher volatility.
Overall, we feel good about our corporate credit quality and like consumer, we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio and reserve levels relative to the stresses we see out there today.
Revenues of $73 million declined significantly from last year, reflecting the wind down of legacy asset, the impact of lower rates, as well as marks on legacy securities as spreads widened during the quarter.
And the pretax loss was $535 million this quarter, higher than our previous outlook, reflecting loan loss reserves on our legacy portfolio, locks on security, the impact of lower rates as well as the special compensation award.
On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $330 million, reflecting the lower rate environment, one fewer day in the quarter and the adjustment in corporate lending that I mentioned earlier.
Based on what weÂre seeing today, on the top line, we expect the revenue trend in the latter part of March and the beginning of April characterized by COVID related lower level of activity, particularly in banking, and our consumer franchise, will continue through much of the second quarter.
On the expense side, there are couple things that are important to consider as we think about running the franchise and managing our expenses, including the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, how do we continue to protect our employees who are on the front line and how do we ensure that we are able to help our customers manage through this.
So you know, you can turn to page 20, weÂve broken out some additional you know, details here and you can see you know, we started or ended the year, I should say with about $14 billion in reserves, youÂre right the lionÂs share that is in cards in split between branded you know, and retail and you know our focus obviously is tends to be on the higher Â the higher FICO scored you know, clients and that skews certainly the case in cards and tends to be higher on retail services, but not quite as high as on the cardsÂ side.
So lots of puts and takes going you know, through the model, the Â those economic assumptions change kind of straight through the end of the quarter, but the short of it is that you know, based on our outlook as have been you know, this additional build of $2.4 billion per cards you know was the appropriate amount for us to take.
Yeah, Glenn, I would say that the actions that weÂve seen out of the combination of the Fed and the Treasury are truly extraordinary, not just in terms of the volume of dollars and programs, but I think the breath thatÂs there and the speed at which theyÂve implemented them I mean, whether itÂs it's been the CP facility, the money market liquidity facility, the repo facilities, the broader corporate pieces, the SBA loans and now not something thatÂs being talked about that much, but this main street program thatÂs there.
Yeah, sure I mean, what I said was that you know, if you take the cards portfolio we have today which is of a better quality, then it was back in Â08, and you were to stress it for the Â08 financial crisis that yes, our pro forma loss rates would be 25% to 30% lower than what we experienced in the last crisis.
And youÂve seen our CET1 ratio dropped to 11.2% this quarter and as the needs of our clients evolve, weÂre going to be there for them and that means that our ratio takes more pressure than weÂll manage through that.
Do you expect them to persist for you know, many quarters, many years or do you think that you know, we will, over the next 12 months see some pay down of that through terming out in the capital markets and maybe also give us a sense as to the associated deposits, how much of the drawdowns came back into you know, your liquidity via the deposits and persistency there as well would be helpful?
But again, I think you know, certainly coming into the second quarter, weÂve actually seen really de minimis draws on the facilities and I think in our dialogues, we donÂt see or feel that pressure right now.
We are in conversations with our regulator and I think Mark said you know, we feel that weÂve got a lot of capacity in terms of capital and things that we can do before we get near triggering any conversations around dividend, but again, weÂre going to treat that as a time when it comes.
So if you kind of separate the branded cards from the retail services and just can you help us talk about just what youÂre seeing Â you know, relatively speaking in terms of we can see it in the rate of change that happened in the first quarter, but would you expect divergence in either spending trends, volume balances and credit as this evolves or any color you can help us with there?
And ultimately you know, as I said, we would expect the second quarter to have some of that top line pressure play through and over the course of the year to see a pickup in NCLs subject to, of course, how things like the $2 trillion relief package and some of the other customer relief offerings that we put out take hold.
So I mean, if you think about CECL and how it works in the idea of building expected lifetime losses in any given quarter, there are number of factors that come into play, you know, so your probability of recession, your severity of recession, our view on the important economic variables and how theyÂre going to play out as well as balances.
Maybe you could just talk about kind of whatÂs going on in Mexico and Asia and some of your bigger markets there in terms of you know things that might soften the blow for the consumer.
And we actually have been you know, very closely monitoring as youÂve seen over the past number of quarters our loan volumes have, in fact, trended lower than that of the broader industry as weÂve you know, been and quite vigilant about focus and staying inside of our risk parameters, which again, do skew higher than most of the peers in that country.
I would expect that you know, with that as a backdrop, and again, subject to a lot of things including how customers respond to the relief programs that are out there, so on and so forth that we would see additional builds in the second quarter.
You should have a little more of a head start than other banks that donÂt have that experience and what are you seeing in terms of you know, volumes and credit losses and your ability to work with the clients?
And frankly, as this continues to evolve with all of the uncertainty that it comes with, we would expect that weÂre going to be a critical partner to these large multinational clients as they think about what the new norm looks like.
Hello and welcome to CitiÂs First Quarter 2020 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason.
Our earnings were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we had strong revenue performance as the economic shocks caused by the pandemic werenÂt felt until late in the quarter and we continue to show expense discipline.
While weÂve built significant loan loss reserves, no one knows what the severity or longevity of the virusÂs impact on the global economy will be.
Investments weÂve made in our technology have allowed us to operate very smoothly in a set of circumstances that would have been hard to imagine with such a large share of our workforce working remotely at the same time.
These investments are also helping us to serve our clients through digital and mobile channels whether itÂs a consumer depositing a check or a corporate treasurer managing liquidity.
While we havenÂt been a large player in small business lending, weÂre ramping up our efforts so we can support clients who participate in the Payroll Protection Plan, and we have additional consumer relief programs in place in our international consumer franchise.
WeÂve also been helping the communities we served during this extraordinarily difficult time, partnering with groups like the World Health Organizations, CitiÂs foundations have already committed $30 million today to support those impacted and weÂll make additional announcements in coming days.
But we feel confident in our ability to manage through whatever scenario comes to pass and with that, Mark will go through our presentations and then weÂd be happy to answer your questions.
However, deposit growth remains strong across regions and weÂre leveraging digital channels to engage with our client.
WeÂre combining this financial strength with operational resiliency, given investments in our people, operations and technology along with digital capabilities which allow us to partner with and support our clients as we all manage through this crisis.
Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
Branded cards revenue of $2.3 billion grew 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% loan growth and continued spread expansion with net interest revenue as a percentage of loans improving to 933 basis points this quarter.
As I noted earlier, digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter even as we continue to adjust pricing, given the current rate environment.
While AUMs declined by 6% due to market movements, we drove continued growth in Citigold households and investment fees during the quarter and mortgage revenues grew as a result of increased refinancing activity.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were down 1% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume related costs.
This was offset by lower purchase sales activity and loan balances in our card business, driven by restrictions on movement and changes in customer behavior.
Turning to Latin America, total consumer revenues were largely unchanged year-over-year and grew 3% excluding a residual gain last year on the sale of our asset management business.
I would also note that we are taking appropriate actions to manage new and existing credit exposures, including investments in our operation.
The credit profile of our clients has improved over time, as we have remained disciplined and tightened down lending criteria since the crisis, which is reflected in our more stable NCL rates over the past few years.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were largely unchanged from last year, outperforming the market wallet as growth in M&A and equity underwriting were offset by decline in debt underwriting.
However, I would note that investment grade debt underwriting was up double-digits year-over-year, as we helped our clients source liquidity in this evolving environment.
Private bank revenues of $949 million grew 8%, driven by increased capital markets activity as we supported our clients through turbulent market conditions.
Total operating expenses of $5.8 billion increased 3% year-over-year as efficiency savings were more than offset by higher compensation costs, continued investments and volume-driven growth.
In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.5 billion this quarter declined slightly year-over-year as the impact of lower rates was mostly offset by loan growth and an extra day, along with higher trading related NIR.
Here we feel good about the investments weÂve made over the last few years in technology.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question is from the line of Matt OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Security.
But you know, first I want to get your perspective on the DFAST stress losses and whether you think itÂs a good reference point to judge reserve adequacy under CECL, because we do get a lot of questions asking why allowance level are so much below, what the nine quarter stress losses are in the severely adverse scenario in the adversary.
ItÂs about an 80 basis points against all the exposures, but yeah, youÂre looking at non-investment grade being 21% of the portfolio.
