amazon,q2,2015,"The increase in capital expenditures and capital leases reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
You clearly had a lot of things working well in the quarter, but maybe just focusing in on AWS, which seems to be quickly emerging as kid of your largest contributor to operating income.
Can you maybe provide a little more color on what drove the acceleration and just the overall growth in the business?
If you could talk a little bit about the addition of new customers versus average spend per customer and I think in the past you've talked about what unit growth was for AWS?
I wanted to know Ã¢ÂÂ you've talked a little bit about that market in the past Ã¢ÂÂ whether there was any update there in terms of how you think about approaching the market and the level of investments that might be needed to compete in the market?
So we're very happy, very encouraged early on with what we've seen in the ramping of the business, the level of invention going on for both customers and sellers.
We are also seeing a great efficiency in the business on a cost basis.
We are continuing to drive operational improvement in every business that we are in, but we are also investing in large opportunities that are in front of us, particularly in Marketplace Prime and AWS.
He said we're going to look for things that are important to customers, customers love them, businesses that can grow to be a large size that can generate a high return on invested capital and are durable and can last for decades.
A lot of it is the top-line growth, but it's also a lot of the efficiency we're seeing, particularly on the fulfillment and marketing lines, which for the whole company were flat year-over-year on a percent of revenue basis.
Just two things I wanted to ask, First on Prime Day. Brian, if you could give a little more color there on the early takeaways that you have and then also perhaps more importantly how you think that sets Amazon up for the back-to-school season and then also the holidays later in the year?
We continue to look for smart, innovative people who want to build on behalf of customers and Ã¢ÂÂ but this particular quarter is colored a bit by the operations growth.
We are looking for return on invested capital, free cash flow, and happy customers in the space.
I will also say that Amazon is one of the primary large customers of AWS so we see it in the consumer side of the business as well, although that's not included in AWS revenue.
We are really following the model of giving our customers as many choices as possible and letting them choose whether they want to buy first-party or third-party and I think we're working really hard to make sellers succeed on the platform.
Brian touched on the success that our FDA sellers had with Prime Day, but we see FBA as a tailwind for third-party business in general.
On the price reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving costs out of the business and you can certainly see where we've even done that over the last several quarters if you look at the margins in AWS.
As I said earlier we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business on the Amazon site as well.
We look to increase the leverage of our fixed assets, particularly our fulfillment centers and the throughput of the fulfillment centers, and just generally getting inventory closer to customers as we add and expand warehouses in the sort centers that we added primarily last year.
So like I said, a little early for the update at this point but something we're looking at and something the team's working really hard on.
In the Retail business obviously a lot of variables driving growth there, we're seeing higher Prime membership levels for one, but I wonder how much of that growth you can also break down by some other factors; for example, we're seeing a notable increase in selection across longer tail categories?
So, Brian, I know you guys don't like to provide guidance beyond the next quarter but philosophically if we go back a few quarters you've characterized 2015 as a year where you believe that some of the heavier investments made in prior years should start to benefit and pay off.
And we're see Ã¢ÂÂ we're clearly seeing that in AWS and in North America retail and it looks like you're still investing heavily on International retail.
And then a few other things you may have seen in our press release today, the launch of Mexico which we are excited about and Amazon business.
We are definitely working for operational efficiencies in the business that we're in.
Brian, just to follow-up on the India question earlier.
And I think as Brian mentioned, India is a country that we're doubling down on based on the success we've seen there so far.
We drive a lot of repeat business with things like Prime Pantry and Subscribe and Save and others.
Second, there have been a couple questions about shipping but most notable is that we had a couple price increases from the majors hit at the beginning of the year and it seems like you're costs are coming down.
On the FCs and whether we would expand or build new, I think we are looking to always get the most out of the fulfillment centers that we have and as we need new facilities we place them closer and closer to customers so that can have its benefits as well, but not much more to add on that one.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 23, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements.
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's conference call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $23.18 billion, or 27% excluding the $1.39 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign-exchange.
Consistent with prior periods we do not allocate two segments, our stock-based compensation, or the other operating expense line item.
Media revenue grew 6% to $2.62 billion or 7% excluding foreign-exchange.
North America segment operating income increased 113% to $703 million a 5.1% operating margin.
Excluding the $9 million favorable impact from foreign-exchange, North America segment operating income increased 111%.
Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.09 billion or increased 3% excluding foreign-exchange.
EGM revenue grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign-exchange.
EGM revenue grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign-exchange.
International segment operating loss includes $89 million of unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange.
Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 407% to $391 million, a 21.4% operating margin.
Excluding the $71 million favorable impact from foreign-exchange, AWS segment operating income increased 314%.
Consolidated segment operating income increased 166% to $1.07 billion or 4.6% of revenue, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year.
Excluding the $9 million unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange, CSOI increased 168%.
Inventory increased 12% to $7.47 billion and inventory turns were 8.9 turns down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't include additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and if foreign-exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
This guidance anticipates approximately 620 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between $480 million loss and $70 million of income compared to a $544 million loss in the third quarter of 2014.

amazon,q3,2015,"As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International and Amazon Web Services.
The first question, Brian, International retail growth continues to improve, and I was wondering if you can just talk through some of the dynamics there, understanding that consumption tax in Japan comped, you have some newer markets where you have physical infrastructure now in Europe, and then also the dynamics in India and China as contributors.
I'll remind you that Prime Day was a global event, so we saw that is International as well, and it was a great event for Ã¢ÂÂ a great day for customers, Amazon and sellers alike.
So like AWS, the model remains early days and we enjoy leading this business and customers responded well and we believe we are adding new services and features at a rate faster than many others.
And if you could give us a sense of what CapEx for this segment of the business looked like in the quarter, and the rate of growth there would be helpful.
This is a young and rapidly growing business, and as you've seen looking backwards, certainly growth rates and margins and capital expenditure timing can be bumpy.
We're excited about the potential there, and really the team's focused on just keeping their heads down and continuing to accelerate the pace of innovation to try to continue to grow the functionality gap we think we offer.
And so, on the AWS side, we've got investment going on around the world, certainly additional servers to support the strong growth we have.
And some of the expense for things like data centers or new regions can be a little lumpy, and we've mentioned a couple of new regions we're working on throughout the world.
On EGM growth, I won't call out any particular categories, but it is a direct reflection of our efforts to grow selection, both our retail selection and also our third party, particularly FBA which is also Prime eligible and then just the responsiveness of our customers, especially our Prime customers to the EGM product line.
So we are very encouraged, as I said last quarter in India, and continue to invest there very heavily.
So we're continuing to work on some of the items we've been talking about for a couple of quarters now.
I think Amazon Global Store continues to expand the selection there.
We added about another 400,000 items to that store this quarter and continue to focus on using our global network of vendors to be able to get those products to customers.
Can you call out in terms of the 3P business what you're seeing in terms of third party sellers maybe needing to make more and more of their goods Prime eligible?
So, we have seen growth in FBA, it increases our Prime fast track eligible selection which we like and customers like.
We've been working on our network for about 20 years to be able to enable some of the really fast delivery with things like Prime Now. But at this point, we're in a relatively small list of cities, but it's expanding pretty fast.
So I just wanted to ask, is that a legitimate question do you think or are you now at a point of scale and market share and maturity that you can sustainably manage the heavy investment while still delivering material profit?
We've already talked about India but domestically we are, globally, we are investing very heavily in our Prime platform, both in North America and International and that includes video content and original content, Prime Music.
So there is a lot of investment going on and there will be continued, especially related to Prime.
The good thing about 30% revenue growth is it gives you a lot more cost to work on as well.
And then the second one, just curious for comments on International Prime sub growth.
We're not going to update our Prime subscription growth beyond what we said last year at the end of last year, which last year in a year when we raised prices early in 2014.
We continue to launch other Prime benefits, Amazon Pantry in Japan and Germany this quarter.
We launch Prime Now in the U.K. So, it's very similar to the U.S. story, potentially time lagged a bit, but we are seeing the same customer adoption and impact on growth rates.
Now, at this scale I know with the 50% plus growth rates that you just mentioned, if you roll the clock two or three years, one can see Prime penetration in markets like the U.S. starting to saturate as there are just so many homes in the country.
We think it's an interesting part of the selection offer for Prime and it's, in many ways, something that we can do that others can't, because it's a natural evolution of our 20-year effort to grow our fulfillment center network and our scale quite frankly makes it possible to even offer this to customers.
We think we have Ã¢ÂÂ we're attractive both to customers and to sellers and we like our position.
So continuing to work on Prime.
We continue to see really strong usage growth across the board, and it's coming from customers of all sizes.
And then the second question is North America and EGM growth accelerating again this quarter.
Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $25.4 billion, or 30% excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 272 million, up from approximately 244 million in the comparable prior-year period.
North America segment operating income includes $11 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
EGM revenue grew 14% to $5.9 billion, or 32% excluding foreign exchange.
International segment operating loss includes $64 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
AWS segment operating income includes $78 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income was $993 million or 3.9% of revenue, up approximately 460 basis points year-over-year.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
This guidance anticipates approximately 340 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, GAAP operating income to be between $80 million and $1.28 billion compared to $591 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $700 million and $1.9 billion compared to $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter 2014.

amazon,q4,2015,"These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth, due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year.
As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international, and Amazon web services.
North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period.
Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion.
Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period.
Did we see more aggressive promotional activity and maybe talk about how you tried to work that to continue to drive the Prime number of members going forward?
Can you help give us a sense as to maybe what we're trying to accomplish with that, if it's defensive to protect your service to your existing customers or if you're looking to maybe start new businesses with those assets?
On gross margin, I would - first I'll caution you and say, we would encourage you to look at free cash flow, which was Ã¢ÂÂ grew at minimum of $4 billion on each of the metrics that we point out and our profit which was up 88% year-over-year.
And the operational improvements, excuse me, the gross margin, operating margin year-over-year that we've seen in the AWS business has been heavily driven by operating efficiencies, both purchase reductions and purchase prices and also efficiency in driving greater utilization of the assets that we have.
So very, very pleased with the critical acclaim to the Amazon Studios content and we've got a lot of new content coming out this year.
So it's still early, but we're encouraged and we think we're creating some value, a lot of value for our business customers.
I think you added well over a billion in revenue year-on-year in the quarter, but from a CSOI perspective, you really didn't see any improvement there.
I just wondered if you could unpack that a little bit and give us a sense of, you know, what profitability looks like maybe in some of your more mature, established countries and regions, relative to the investments you were making in other countries, so that we can kind of get a better picture of what's actually going on under the hood there?
And then second, last quarter, and I don't want to misquote you, but you said something along the lines of being able to invest as you'd like and also deliver good profit and that the pendulum wouldn't swing as far perhaps as it has in the past.
We didn't break it out by segment, but we said that Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 run rate, revenue growth rate.
As I said in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for fulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance and much greater FBA share, and not to mention all the investments in AWS, we are constantly looking for cost efficiencies and fixing variable productivity.
We've heard the comments about the number of availability zones that are being launched this year, which is obviously about, a big part of driving incremental capacity in that business and just trying to balance those, think about how we should balance those three things?
Most of our capacity and capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers demand growth.
On a dollar basis, we continue to grow Ã¢ÂÂ we saw the greatest growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and, again, we continue to invent, now with our price, we continue to innovate on behalf of customers and see great customer response.
In terms of expectations, I think we were pleased with what we saw this Q4 and, you know, if you look at what we gave for guidance, we were in the upper half of the range there for revenue.
And if you look at some of our new offerings like Prime Now that's available through a mobile app and very convenient for customers.
In lieu of that, can you comment on whether 4Q saw higher than usual costs for streaming content compared to other quarters in the year?
So your question about the AWS margins, that business as they continued to learn and as we continue to invent and get better at designing and operating the infrastructure and assets, we have been able to drive costs out of that business.
There's also an FX tailwind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter, which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises because we're largely priced in dollars, but have assets with local currency costs throughout the world.
I want to just quickly revisit the margin pendulum question and some of your comments, as you mentioned that to kind of expect it to ebb and flow.
On the speed of delivery, this is Phil, you know, all I can say is the customers love the service.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, January 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principle repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million.
Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior year period.

amazon,q1,2016,"These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investment in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results.
For reference, this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other.
North America segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year.
International segment operating loss, including stock-based compensation and other, was $121 million, compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year.
International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million, compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year.
Amazon Web Services segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year.
Consolidated segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $1.7 billion or 5.7% of revenue, compared to $706 million in the prior year.
Your first question on international, yes, all three segments had very strong growth in the quarter.
As we may have mentioned in the past, we feel that Europe and large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the U.S. on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015, 47% in the U.S. and a higher rate than that internationally.
So certainly, a lot going on in international, a lot that's really good, adding Prime subscribers at a high clip, continuing to add selection at FBA sellers.
Just wanted to ask you about unit growth overall and if we look back over the last three quarters, you've accelerated it now to a materially higher level than what we saw in 2014 and the first half of 2015, and I realize in 3Q last year you had Prime Day. And as you open up six new regions in coming months, should we expect this to be constant build-out or something that's more lumpy over time and more in waves?
I think when we look at the bridges for revenue, and obviously units are a key driver of revenue, things like Prime are key in that bridge.
We're very pleased with the quarter, we came in at 23.5% operating margin on a Ã¢ÂÂ the new basis including stock-based compensation and other.
But stepping back with the 64% growth in AWS which is now a $10 billion business, but on the margin side, I would caution you that we're pleased but it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the long-term margins in this business, they'll be bumpy over time.
At any point in time they're going to reflect the balance of investing including global expansion that he's talked about, price reductions we may offer, and also driving cost efficiency, which for us is a very important driver in not only this business but also the North America and international segments.
And on your AWS footprint question, so we ended the quarter with 33 Availability Zones in 12 geographic regions, and we have five Ã¢ÂÂ 11 more Availability Zones opening in the next year.
We love the Ã¢ÂÂ customers love the content and we like the results we see, particularly around Prime free trial conversion and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime.
But we think that's working and look forward to bringing a lot of new content to our Prime subscriber base, both through our normal Prime subscription and also the monthly plan that you alluded to.
We will continue to add fulfillment capacity, we will work with FBA sellers on inventory stocking and timing and we think that there's things that we can do better as we do every year, come out of fourth quarter with immense learnings.
And secondly, Brian, you said that the growth of Prime has been driven by investments you have made and are making.
So we think there's a lot of room to grow in not only our international countries, but also in the U.S. So we plan on continuing to build the benefits of the Prime program from music to video, to two-day shipping, to same-day shipping, to Prime Now. And again, it remains the best deal in retail.
We're very pleased with the results we're seeing on the top and bottom line, but margins are going to be bumpy and affected by levels of investing, price reductions and also cost efficiencies that we're driving.
Wanted to understand how we should think about the puts and takes in gross margin, it has evolved to be a much higher number over the last couple of years, what some of the puts and takes are going forward especially with respect to content costs?
I think the bigger issues that you should look at in gross margin, and again starting with the comment that we expanded by 300 basis points year-over-year, that is really driven by, first of all, the AWS growth and again, $10 billion business growing 64% is very Ã¢ÂÂ we're very pleased with that and that affects gross margin as well.
So we have stepped up investment, although it did not go up as much year-over-year this quarter, we are still spending almost $10 billion on what essentially is fulfillment capacity in support of really strong growth, unit growth and FBA, and global expansion and then also on AWS, additional capacity for existing customers as they grow their business and also new regions.
We are not in the business of raising prices, we lower prices for AWS, so there can be mix for products, but by and large, if you see our revenue growth, know that we are also lowering prices which means that by math, we are typically going to be growing usage at a very strong rate.
And it's a lot of the drivers we talked about, as Brian mentioned on the revenue growth side, Prime, selection, growth.
Yes. And on AmazonFresh, we continue to have a strong Fresh business in a number of cities in the U.S. We know customers love it.
I think you see the growth rate of the segment at 27%.
The other thing I would add to that is that the margin you see in any quarter is really the output of our rate of investment at some places and drive for efficiencies in others.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 28, 2016 only and will include forward-looking statement.
Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayment and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion.
Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion or 29% excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
These amounts are combined and titled stock-based compensation and other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations.
North America segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year.
Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange.
Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year.
Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we expand selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Can you talk about how you're thinking about planning against that as the Prime flywheels are getting broader for you, how do you try to get ahead of that into the peak season later this year?
Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
I think it's a mathematical certainty that Prime subscribers will decelerate in North America at some point from 50% growth.
So over 26% growth in this quarter alone coming off a year where I believe the number was 722 significant new features and services delivered for AWS customers last year.

Amazon Web Services' operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin compared with $305 million in the prior year.
This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
Our guidance also assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Our next question comes from Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray.
Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.
Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.
Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Robert W.
Our next question comes from Brian Pitz from Jefferies.
So I would just say Prime Day had enormous impact on the device business and devices were well featured and also well adopted by customers.
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Yeah, let me talk a little bit about guidance and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question.
So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later.
And we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows Ã¢ÂÂ TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year.
I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend.
In terms of questions, the customer count, can you give us a little bit of guidance on that?
And then also talk about the theme of automated consumption and separately, the importance of Prime Now and how you can kind of grow those SKUs. Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon
Of course, we do always talk about Ã¢ÂÂ we always usually get asked about profitability and it is a very hard service to deliver and make money on, but we know customers love it and we're in a great position to do this because of our long-term approach, our drive of greater efficiencies and our proximity to the customer with our vast global FC network.
I was wondering as it relates to the Q3 guidance, can you give us a bit of a sense of just how we should think about margins in the AWS business, especially as the next eight availability zones roll out?
But to your question about AWS, we actually see nine availability zones in four regions coming out in the next Ã¢ÂÂ in the coming year.
The impact on short-term is pretty much indistinguishable from the growth that we're seeing in our expansion of our base customers in our existing regions, so we don't see a large step-up from the addition of new regions relative to the large and rapid growth in the business itself.
As I look at your tech and content expense as a percentage of revenues, we see year-on-year decline for the last two quarters, which is something we hadn't seen since mid-2010, and of course it's reflected in the AWS margins.
So, there's a lot of great work going on there and I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the tech and content line.
So, the move into Boston and also now into London give us some really good data points and as Ã¢ÂÂ it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering.
Some of the products overlap, of course, but we're happy with both, and we think that customers like both of them.
I remember last quarter you called out really starting to see, kind of I don't know, critical mass tipping point, whatever the buzzword is, from Prime and from FBA in international markets.
So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North America and international, we are seeing great acceptance of Prime and usage of Prime benefits.
We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable, and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice-versa.
We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India, and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, but local content and also Amazon Originals.
So we take both roles very seriously around here, investing on the right Ã¢ÂÂ in the right things, seeing results on behalf of customers, and also driving efficiencies.
And there can be timing, quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly continue to expand.
We are certainly expanding our service offerings in the transportation side and we have been for many years, things like sortation centers and delivery methods.
And then second thing, when you look at the U.S. Prime penetration versus total U.S. customers, how do you feel about that and do you think there's still a lot of room for Prime growth in the U.S.?
We know that, again, when customers try Prime, they like it.
Let me take that first question on Prime Air in the UK, we've been working with and developing Prime Air for some time to develop a rapid delivery system that is safe, environmentally sound and it really enhances the services that we provide for millions of customers.
You heard that we launched the Prime program this week, which will be a whole new experience for Indian customers.
We think it'll enter into a new chapter in India, and we've seen great success every country in the world that we've launched Prime, and we feel India is going to be no different.
So, yes, this is really to support both the customers that we have there in Italy and throughout Europe, and we'll continue to invest in the coming years.
",62.82,0.9723831
amazon,q3,2016,"We're also investing in digital content and additional Prime benefits, fresh location Prime Now. But by far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make and very excited about it, the initial reaction in India from both the customers and also sellers.
I guess when we think about the progression of margins in the second half versus the second half of 2015 and kind of the flat-lining of overall margin at this point excluding AWS, I guess should we think about this as being a temporary kind of plateau that will at some point resume once you start leveraging the fulfillment build-out?
Well we will continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction.
Most of those are in North America but that compares to 14 last year and I would look, looking back the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter.
So we continue to build for high AFN, or Amazon Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA.
So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is a step-up investment primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service, think (7:54) rapid growth in that business.
In the past, I think you've talked about how it takes time to kind of get the fulfillment centers to peak efficiencies, so with these new FCs opening, could you just talk about it?
On the AWS question, yeah, we continue to invest in AWS on behalf of our customers in addition to the technologies that make integrations easier that helps companies move from an on-prem or a hybrid IT environment into AWS.
So we're going to continue to do that, specifically things like the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when they move production databases from on premises to the cloud with virtually no downtime.
So yeah, were doing a lot of things to help make it easier for all customers to migrate to AWS.
And how big that, any way to help us quantify how big that already is to the revenue growth that you're seeing, particularly on groceries and any particular comments on fashion and apparel, same line of thinking?
Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it's a very attractive service to our customers, which is what we're after.
So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers and we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs.
And Prime Now, we're also very happy with, although obviously the economics in that business are even tougher, but we do feel that our scale makes that possible because of the geographic footprint and how close we already are to customers.
We continue to work with brands to come on board and we're happy with the traction we're seeing with those brands.
Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. To answer your question about was that part of investment.
Yes, this is certainly part of our investment but the large ramp, if you will, in investment that we're seeing from the back end of last year and also the first half of this year is more related to digital content and the build in our fulfillment network, which I've already discussed.
And the biggest issue you're trying to get at is having the most valuable products for holiday in the warehouse in the Prime space and not having the warehouse filled with things that may not sell until after the New Year.
But the things that we're seeing hit the P&L are the fixed and variable expenses that it takes to run the building and I think that's what Brian's pointing out most pointedly in terms of what is impacting the profitability of the second half.
Your question on fulfillment expenses, I can't extend the guidance into next year.
A follow-up on the FC question, and I guess more specifically it sounds like you have enough capacity in terms of fulfillment centers for the holidays, but also wondering what your comfort level is in terms of your shipping partners to manage those deliveries.
So yeah, we looking forward to a great holiday and that includes working with our shipping partners both in the U.S. and globally.
I guess when you look at fourth quarter guidance and you back out AWS, it suggests that margins are, on the core business, are going to be pretty down versus last year.
Yes. As far as the continuation of the investment into next year, I cannot give you much color on that today.
We are experiencing a ramp-up, if you will, in the second half of this year particularly tied again to AWS, or excuse me, the fulfillment center spend and also the video content spend.
We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience.
We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient, as profitable as possible while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line.
The investment that we are seeing is a step-up versus what we have experienced in particularly the first half of this year and the last half, the second half of last year which I mentioned.
So we will try different delivery methods or pick-up points or ways of getting product to customers, but nothing specific to point out on the grocery side right now.
And as Brian pointed out earlier, our AFN unit, our Amazon fulfilled units, which include our first-party units as well as FBA units that go through our warehouses are continuing, are certainly higher than that 28%.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. So thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions.

Our next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.
",59.47,0.78503
amazon,q4,2016,"So yes, what you are seeing, John, is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year.
And then separately as it relates to just the video service, from a positioning standpoint in the market, how do you think about the unique aspects of the product that Amazon has relative to others in the market in terms of the aggregation tools that are being provided now where some of the value is being perceived longer-term?
Well, ultimately, I'll step back and say one of the main things we look out on Prime Video is customer usage patterns and in 2016 we had a doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading.
I'll also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the second half of last Ã¢ÂÂ or, excuse me, in Q4.
Yes, the investment did step up in the second half of last year, including marketing.
The offering in China that we have for consumers is also a great, trusted customer engagement.
We continue to say that, but we are very encouraged with what we've created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years.
We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers.
But we like the initial engagement we're seeing and the response from, again, both customers and sellers.
And then my whether question is whether you can shed any more light on the motivation to build out the air cargo hub in Cincinnati, understanding the need to support the growth of the core retail business, but also if this gives you more of an opportunity to build out direct connections to suppliers, for example, or a longer-term offer excess capacity or logistics as a service.
And, sorry, the second question is on the hub in Cincinnati Ã¢ÂÂ or excuse me, in Kentucky.
But the engagement is just like any other Prime benefit or investment that we have.
So it's a great, again, part of the flywheel in that, Echo and Alexa make the devices better and it builds engagement, not only with Echo and Alexa, but also with Amazon.
We continue to add Prime members and similar to the flywheel that Brian was just mentioning, that the FBA selection helps us with engaging customers and in particular the Prime program.
So we're very pleased with our customer engagement this year.
So as you point out, we've had Amazon Logistics deliveries in the UK for more years than some of our other countries and what we see is it gives us control of the shipment for a lot longer.
I think it's a great value to our customers.
But we test, we innovate, we think the bookstores for instance are a really great way for customers to engage with our devices and see them, touch them, play with them and become fans.
Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. But I will say on Ã¢ÂÂ you're talking about the levels of engagement now that we're seeing versus what would be the long-term model over time.
So, we see a double benefit of the global Prime Video program, again both to amortize the investment in original content but also to show that original content to more and more people, because we think it's done really well.
We think it's won a lot of awards and we've worked with some Ã¢ÂÂ again some great, talented people.

We've been pretty clear that this business is all about creating new functionality for customers, giving price cuts and then working on the operating efficiencies.
The other data point I'll give you that affects our cost structure is our Amazon Fulfilled units, which is the combination of retail plus FBA, grew nearly 40% last year and that compares to our paid unit growth of 24% in Q4.
Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W.

I guess it would be curious to hear how you think about the importance of an Amazon brick and mortar presence and how that fits into the long-term strategy?

We've had Ã¢ÂÂ customers migrated more than 23,000 data basis using the AWS Database Migration Service since that launched last year.
Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.
Brian, I had a couple questions about your growing advertising business.
And then second, I think it's fairly obvious why someone selling within the Amazon ecosystem would be interested in promoting on the platform, but maybe tell us a little bit about maybe over the long-term there are opportunities for sort of non-endemic advertisers within your platform.
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
And the fulfillment centers I'll also say with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses, and then they generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start-up.
Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W.
Let me start with your middle question.
Let me step back and talk about international growth in general.
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS.
So I'm not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates, other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into Q1.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
We just opened up Amazon Fresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business B2B business just opened up in the UK.
The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip than our paid unit growth.
And then secondly on these Ã¢ÂÂ on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within households?
We think as engagement Ã¢ÂÂ as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole.
And the big picture is, again, as we've said customers Ã¢ÂÂ the things customers love can grow to be large, we'll have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades.
Things like Prime Music, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, all expanding globally.
We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled unit is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity.
You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones.
We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses and we're also developing services for AWS customers.
But I think the general theme is there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about, and we continue to ramp those investments.
So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon Robotics areas.
Brian, I think you mentioned the accelerating growth within AWS on new products and last year you added about 1,000.
You clearly see our Ã¢ÂÂ we break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and operating income, and you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those.
So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity.
Just curious if you'd say Ã¢ÂÂ have you made a lot of progress in terms of catching up with some of the fulfillment needs that you saw necessary in the business at the beginning of last year?
And then I know you just said that you're Ã¢ÂÂ it's still early days in terms of advertising, but there's a perception out there that over the last year or so that the company has sort of really begun to focus more on this business opportunity.
Our scale and number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs, and new content Ã¢ÂÂ video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business.
We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers Ã¢ÂÂ for FBA sellers.
We're not breaking out the specific growth rates for Prime, but certainly it Ã¢ÂÂ we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been consistent with what we have seen over the last quarter or so.
You talked a lot about the fulfillment centers, but could you update us on where we are in terms of rolling out Prime Now facilities and sorting centers?
Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sort centers, right.
Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. We're still growing that and we're happy with the progress in Prime Now and the service that Ã¢ÂÂ the value that it creates for Prime customers.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. Thank you for joining us on our call today and for your questions.

amazon,q2,2017,"Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
The other dynamic is that, similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3.
Other than that, can't give much more specifics except to say that the large investment areas remain the increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of the FBA business.
On your larger question about what the place of Amazon Fresh, likely Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I would say we believe there'll be no one solution, so we're experimenting with a number of the formats from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and Amazon Fresh.
So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments, what we were within the guidance range and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistics services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa, Echo devices and Alexa platform India, the buildup at the AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned not to mention Prime Now and Amazon Fresh and Prime benefits.
Right now, what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising.
So, I saw firsthand the customer experience, I think, that's what we're seeing as a benefit to the physical stores right now.
Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. So, yes, we've had numerous price decreases, and we continue to have that in the AWS business, both absolute decreases in service costs and also rolling out new services that may be cannibalizing more expensive other services that we provide.
What I can say, the biggest dynamic going on again is that Amazon fulfilled unit growth of nearly 40%, which was last year and carrying into this year.
We are matching that with just over 30% increase in square footage, and you're right, that does include some shipping sort centers and things that are incremental and new functions for us, if you will.
I just wanted to follow up on AWS, and just on the back of the price cut, obviously 1Q being the first full quarter, but it looks like 2Q, as Mark said, things did stabilize some.
On AWS, yes, we are seeing great customer adoption.
So the AWS revenue growth showed almost no change but the AWS operating margin was lower I guess than we've seen in, I don't know, six quarters or something like that.
And again, we like what we see and we'll continue to expand that and we'll be working very hard on making that not only a valuable Prime offering, a Prime benefit, but also a lower-cost operation as well.
I would just like to use that maybe as a springboard to talk a little bit about what you think the right mix is for how you sell in terms of self-service versus salespeople.
On operating margins internationally, I would step back and say a lot of the investments we're making in North America we're also making in international.
Prime benefits including Prime Video and remember we launched Global Video in Q4 of last year to 200 countries, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, the general rise of FBA and added selection, both retail and FBA to make Prime more attractive, and the fulfillment and logistics costs that go with that, and the additional constant effort to reduce prices and accelerate shipping.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. So thank you, Brian, and thank you all for joining us on the call today and for your questions.
We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Our first question comes from line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Or should we think about adding different modes such as pick up points and bricks and mortar as serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck around home delivery?
May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment infrastructure investment that you're making is kind of incremental, is geared towards handling growth and sort of the existing business and infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding more inbound or last mile and/or from entering new international markets where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint?
Our usage in all of our large services are actually accelerating and they're growing at a rate higher than our revenue growth.

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
In particular, there's a lot of talk now about potentially using Whole Foods stores for a physical pharmacy presence and also that you've perhaps gotten approvals across multiple states in that category.
And we think we'll be also developing new store formats and everything else just as we talked about in the past before Whole Foods.
Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.
Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.
Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
And particularly how the company and management thinks about entering more regulated businesses over time, how you would approach that versus a standard category that you might go into or maybe again knowing you can't comment on rumors, how you have approached that in the past or in other markets.
Our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel.
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.
Our final question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
We launched month-to-month Prime last year and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go, so there's less that's deferred.
But if you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores, launching the Whole Foods private label products on Amazon, the technical (06:07) work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future.
A lot of the building blocks that we've been working on, all the Prime benefits, advancements in free shipping offers or faster shipping offers, the Prime benefits would drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring.
I think over time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between AmazonFresh, Prime Now, and Whole Foods as we can explore different ways to serve the customer.
In this line item, is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also it's where a lot of our subscription services for digital music, digital video, audiobooks, e-books, so there's some moving parts in there.
And again, on the other subscription services, music especially, it works just so well with our Echo device that we're seeing a lot of growth in that area as we increase the number of Echo devices and customers using the Echo devices.
We continued to hire a lot of sales reps and it's tied directly to our major investment areas of AWS, Prime Video and devices.
As I said, there will be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores.
So, we're really excited about that and I think working together, will bring our different strengths to the table and really be able to build on behalf of customers.
And in terms of the increased losses in the international retail segment of the business, can you provide some color around how much of that's being driven by Amazon launching into new markets, which I know you continue to do, versus investing more heavily in existing markets?
We had the first Prime Day there this year, Prime Music, Amazon Business is also expanding in India.
In video, if you remember in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings, but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers.
I understand you can't comment on rumors one way or the other but curious, as you think about categories like health care and, obviously, you guys are already in health care to some degree through Amazon Business, can you give us a bit of a status update on what you do have out there now?
It's because the video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers.
We're seeing the engagement go up year-after-year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime benefits.
So Whole Foods, I think I mentioned this earlier, but we definitely see commonality and overlap with the Whole Foods business as well as Amazon in total, but specifically Prime Now and also AmazonFresh.
On the ad supported question, I think what you've seen to-date is really particularly as you're looking as a customer, as a Prime Video member and watching content, we view that as you've paid into that service and able to watch those shows ad free.
Just wanted to ask about delivery and just over the last several months, we've seen a lot of announcements and products around delivery options between Lockers, the testing of the Kohl's partnership, Whole Foods obviously, Amazon Key came out recently, just wanted to better understand this investment.

So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume was high, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses were busy.
It's a very positive surprise for us both on a -- adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales with very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner, partners we work with, skills that we've increased rapidly, we're over 30,000 skills for Alexa.
We do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the Video content, their use of it on devices and we will continue to increase our budget in that area.
So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth.
So shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're -- it's going to be increasing due to our business model, and we, at the same time, look then to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area, AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end.
We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website, and we're -- the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program and we expect to have more on that later in the year.
So we're -- continue to be pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in the international countries as well and also in that numbers.
And the second one , Brian, to go back to an earlier question on areas of investment this year, you didn't talk a whole lot about kind of new categories to expand into beyond the old retail business.
Yes, and on new businesses or expansion of categories, as you discussed, I would not talk to anything that's not been publicly announced, but on some of the ones you mentioned, they are underway and are continuing.
I would say on the category side, that the biggest effort will be on continuing to be on groceries and consumables with the Whole Foods acquisition and again, we continue to look at our whole offering of AmazonFresh, Prime Now, Whole Foods, how can they work together to create better and better offerings for our customer base.
Hey, guys, so I wanted to go back to, and I think you said one of the biggest focuses of the year is going to be on the consumables now, Fresh, Whole Foods.
Not just the Whole Foods but just generally across the consumables business in Fresh and Now. I'd say Whole Foods is not less in their commitment to providing the best selection of high-quality products and having them in stock for customers.
And certainly there's other verticals that I didn't mention there that we're interested in continuing to kind of learn from customers what they want and what they're looking for there, and so we'll keep adding selection.
So as an internal customer, the consumer business is very happy with AWS.
And I think AWS is also very benefited by the fact that they have a large internal beta customer that tries out and uses a lot of their products and services.
Yes, I mean, I think right now, we're really just focused on finding ways to work with those companies, whether it's vendors or sellers that are coming to us, and offer them a great experience on the website and ability to be able to reach customers.
Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 1, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements.
In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.
Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
So particularly in North America, I would say there's the volume -- the strong volume -- top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also very clean operational performance.
Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with J.P. Morgan.
We're [indiscernible] $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- actually $18 billion last quarter.
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Wells Fargo.

amazon,q1,2018,"The Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years actually.
We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options.
Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than that online stores revenue.
Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period.
So as far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what we'll look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers.
So first, with the Ã¢ÂÂ you've mentioned North America revenue growth, and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm sure.
So we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime benefits, especially digital benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things.
And in terms of the accounting change that Dave referenced earlier with regard to revenue going from cost of revenue to the other line, can you comment if that particular type of advertising, that trade dollars type of marketing, is that growing at a meaningfully different rate than the ad revenue that's already booked as revenue?
On that second question, we've not commented on the growth rate or given the prior year period, so not much we can say there.
As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at the sort of pre-existing advertised Ã¢ÂÂ or other revenue rather that was included in that line item, we'd be growing about 72%.
First, the top-line growth was Ã¢ÂÂ continued to be strong coming out of Q4.
We also had strong AWS revenue strength, where I already mentioned that we accelerated into the quarter, which is a different trend that we've seen recently.
And then finally, as part of advertising, you've got also a heck of a lot inventory around all of that video, that Prime Video that you have that you don't allow Ã¢ÂÂ that you don't directly charge for, how do you think about that as an advertising revenue opportunity?
Yeah, I think the only thing I'd add to on that just related to Prime Video, as you may have seen in the announcement earlier today about the renewed agreement for the streaming partnership with Thursday Night Football.
So we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the partnership we've had with the NFL.
So, yeah, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the main point, is selection and opportunities for sellers in Ã¢ÂÂ who are with us in different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country.
So in terms of your question of sort of impact from the first-party piece that's been coming online, many of those states came on over a period of time to get to that 45 total, going back over many years.
So there's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the Prime program.
Yeah I don't want to project relative proportions of the different segments, but what I can say is the international continues to see the same level of investment as we're seeing in North America or have seen in North America.
We'll continue to invest in India where we're seeing great progress with both sellers and also customers.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our first question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.
So our philosophy there again is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers.
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
So what we're saying is just continued strong usage both by existing customers and signing new customers for Ã¢ÂÂ see increased pace of enterprise migrations as customers are having success with AWS and increasingly trying new services.
And we have proven operational capability and security expertise that's highly valued to the AWS customer base.
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Our main goal here is to help customers discover new brands and products.
So we show the sponsored products, we're trying to show people things they had maybe wouldn't have seen otherwise in their normal search results.
Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
I mentioned that four years ago when we last increased the price of Prime, you could get 20 million products within two days.
Our next question comes from...

amazon,q2,2018,"Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.
You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again increasing usage at our customers; usage rates are exceeding our growth rate.
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
I mean, in any quarter there can be product mix or ASP differentials which shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver Shipping threshold twice, the early part of last year from $49 to $35; and then down to $25.
We're seeing a lot of our growth areas being fueled by head count that's moving within the company.
Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.
Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
How successful Ã¢ÂÂ you mentioned database, but what other areas you're potentially seeing as customers move up the stack with you and grow?
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
And they're using our services to achieve their marketing goals to Ã¢ÂÂ whether that's to drive new brand awareness, discovery or ultimately purchase decisions on our site.
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS.
We have the delivery services Ã¢ÂÂ so AmazonFresh and Prime Now which serve a certain need.
Our final question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company.
Even while in International, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas, we continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies, we continue to launch new countries as we launch Prime in Australia recently.
So continued Ã¢ÂÂ it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow, and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts.
And then Brian, I'm sorry, you just talked better than expected efficiencies in operations, could I ask you to tease that out a little bit more, and a little more color particularly on the retail side of the business?
On operations, if you look at probably the last 18 months, you're going to see a lot of different pace of increase in both infrastructure costs and capital costs, and the addition of fixed cost heads.
So one thing that you'll notice is that, we've grown Ã¢ÂÂ we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed head count, excluding the acquisitions we've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June, on a trailing 12 month basis.
We don't think that, that's necessarily the long-term trend, but it certainly created a lot of operating efficiencies, and now we'll reset and evaluate where we need to still add people.
So I think the first half of the year could be a good test of where our cost structure is, coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday.
I'll probably clarify that at the end of next quarter as we head into holiday, but if you think back, the last two years, we've added square footage that's exceeded 30% growth, both in 2016 and 2017.
And I think, the second question was just related to how is Alexa impacting the business, overall.
I mean, I think, we're having a lot of success with devices and customers are enjoying those.
We talked to coming out of Prime Day, had some good success and happy customers enjoying some of the devices there.
So I think, that's a lot of Ã¢ÂÂ the focus now is really having a good and exciting roadmap of recent revises and more to come ahead, and getting those into customers' hands.
So it's a Ã¢ÂÂ there's a bit of timing at play here, but I think overall, in the longer-term, we certainly work to drive efficiency in both AWS infrastructure capability, and also in our warehouse networks.
Yeah, let me give Dave a chance afterwards to talk about that piece, but I'll start with advertising.
We think it's a big milestone this quarter to launch Prime benefits with Whole Foods, and we'll keep going, we'll see how that develops.
Of course we started in Music with Prime Music, a little bit earlier in that space, and I think that's been a great way for Prime members to enjoy some of that catalog for free, and then as they enjoy that, be able to move into the Amazon Music Unlimited skill.
So I think your original question was about monetization of Alexa, but right now the biggest thing we can do is to make it as useful as possible, and make devices that can use the skills.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc. Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions.

amazon,q3,2018,"Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
I guess the big one is the deceleration in unit growth or online stores, which are probably related to that.
We had two reactions on our Super Saver Shipping threshold in the first half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit growth in the second and third quarter.
And again, when we're talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising are not caught in that metric.
So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continue to invest in Prime benefits, international expansion as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pickup.
We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple years and as we've funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas as we've talked about, AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of those roles.
Obviously in the last few quarters, you've seen accelerating revenue growth.
We've had sequential increase in growth rate the prior three quarters, I believe, it was.
Maybe can you just help us understand a little bit any of the specific categories or countries that have been the largest contributors to revenue growth throughout the course of this year?
Much of our, not only our revenue for the quarter, but also for the year comes in that very tight window between middle of November and the end of the year.
This year, we took Prime subscription revenue and amortized it over the quarters on a straight line method.
That has again been caught up for in prior quarters, but again not a huge factor on the growth rate for revenue, but just another item to consider.
With a lot of offline retailers talking more about omni-channel, wanted to understand sort of the investments you might be making around unifying the efforts with Whole Foods and Amazon Prime Now, speeding up delivery, giving consumers as much choice as possible and moving SKUs closer to households.
You'll see even this quarter we started to have greater expansion of our grocery delivery out of Whole Foods using Prime Now. We're now in 60 cities in the U.S., giving customers delivery in as fast as an hour on thousands of great organic products from Whole Foods.
And then maybe second question, I think what one of the things people are trying to think through is you obviously guide to revenue and operating income, but as the business is more than 3P and advertising, gross profit is now much more important and just the way you kind of capture the value you provide.
So maybe if you can Ã¢ÂÂ is there a way to just kind of help us kind of foot the perhaps slower revenue growth we're seeing versus what's obviously you extracting kind of more value for your partners and customers and for yourself?
Just quickly on the ASC impact, Brian mentioned earlier that of course we've been talking about it all year the changing, and the subscription revenue recognition is now straight line.
The other piece that we hadn't talked about is the reclass that we gave in the past few quarters, specifically around the advertising services that have moved from Contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018.
And your comment on revenue versus operating income versus potentially gross profit, I would say the impact of third-party growth and we're now Ã¢ÂÂ up to 53% of our paid units in the quarter were third-party.
So I think the impact on revenue growth rate, since the revenue component of that is not as large, is probably something to consider on a year-over-year period.
If we do this right, we think we'll both help advertisers and help Amazon consumers at the same time.
So I know it doesn't answer the question about specific rate increases or capacity, but that is the general strategy that we're seeing in advertising.
I mean I think so much of what we're focused on is making sure that there's a high degree of relevancy and usefulness for customers when you look at advertisements that you see on the site in particular and how we position those.
Let me start with the Amazon Prime price increase.
We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
But we've also had great cost performance this year in three specific areas I'll call out.
In our fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last two years, 2016 and 2017.
Making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Network units that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units.
May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. We are at an annualized run rate above $26 billion and that was about $18 billion this time last year.
So our guidance for the fourth quarter implies 10% to 20% growth and includes an 80-basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
We're not expecting a material impact from these rate changes in 2019.
It's up 300 basis points year-over-year.

And then secondly, just if you could remind us or help us understand the Prime accounting change impact on subscription revenues in Q4?

Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.
Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions.
I guess I'll ask about units, 14% in the quarter, just, how do you feel about the overall unit growth here, given that the growth was higher last year in the 20s and do you think there are some investments you can make in other areas to kind of reaccelerate that going forward?
Just on the second question on the subscription services, weÃ¢ÂÂd said on the last call, you probably remember, related to the adoption of the accounting standards update and revenue recognition policies that was impacting our results in a number of areas in 2018.
And on unit deceleration, I think the unit numbers more and more require some interpretation, because it doesn't include the -- some of our fastest growing areas, the things like, as Dave mentioned, subscription services, AWS, advertising, Whole Foods units are not in that number.
Just comment a little bit on the international revenue outlook and any commentary on India and whether you think there's a material impact on your business?
Headcount only grew 14% year-over-year, but the areas that were growing in that mix were things like technology teams, device areas, AWS, especially sales and marketing.
Brian talked a little bit about it before, but pleased with the holiday season, both from sort of a first party side, but also sellers continuing to do well.
When I try to back out the impact factors like Whole Foods, the advertising accounting change and other factors, what I see is stable and pretty healthy revenue growth for the retail segment, but a slowdown in Q4 from what seems to have been, in more recent quarters, meaningful gross margin expansion in the retail segment.
And then on capital, especially infrastructure capital, if you use the capital lease slide as maybe an indicator for what we have invested into our AWS business to support infrastructure and global expansion, that number grew 10% last year, when it had grown 69% in 2017.
Anything to read into that about sort of what your expectations are for growth in those businesses, seeing that reacceleration after the deceleration that we saw over the course of at least the first three quarters of last year.
I still think the 17% is a low number for us, when you talk about the -- supporting the AWS business that's still growing in a very high clip and a very strong and healthy growth in FBA and customer demand and our expansion into new countries, both with AWS and also with our core consumer business.
Can you just talk to any of the puts and takes we should know about from a gross margin perspective in the fourth quarter and then that other line that I think includes the advertising business, can you just help us, any help at all on the growth of the advertising business or the impact of any of the accounting changes in the quarter?
In the quarter, looking backwards, not considering India and the impact going forward, but the international growth accelerated, so I was curious any particular regions or product categories to call out, especially given some of the weakness in the UK?
We generally work to change the fees to make sure that the incentives are strong on both sides and we continue to have a healthy growth in third party.
And then just on your second question around advertising, if you look at the other revenue, the growth rate decelerated some.
On your comment or question on transportation, we do continue to expand our Amazon logistics and delivery capability and it also matches up with our faster ship speed that we're seeing for Prime members as well.

amazon,q1,2019,"Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Again, as I mentioned last quarter, it is a measurement, excludes a lot of our fastest growing businesses, things like AWS, advertising, subscription services, which cannibalize the unit calculation, things like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited.
So you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas.
We're able to do this, because we spent 20 plus years expanding our fulfillment and logistics network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of us.
And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than Two-Day Shipping for Prime members for years, one day, same day, even down to one to two hour delivery for Prime Now. So we're going to continue to offer same day and Prime Now selection in an accelerated basis.
Our engagement in video benefit - excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky.
The advertising business saw what looks like a little bit of a step-down again in Q1 versus Q4.
So we're very - excuse me, the other point I'll make is just like last quarter, I'll remind you that the physical stores revenue is principally Whole Foods revenue, but it excludes the online ordering component where people order on the Prime Now app and it's delivered to them.
So last quarter, I told you that our growth in store sales, including both shopping and also online deliveries, was closer to 6% in Q4, and it's a similar number in Q1.
And then just a follow-up, just to return to the $800 million investment to improve one-day shipping, it sounds like that investment is underway already and that - in noting that it'll help contribute to the high-end of the guidance this quarter, it sounds like the timing of that is fairly quicker.
I would say that while our 20-year head start in investments in logistics and fulfillment capacity and partner networks that we've built are helping us, we also do have a network that is tuned to two-day delivery right now, principally for two-day delivery.
So we do need to build out more one-day capacity along with our transportation partners, but we're moving quickly and we've got a good head start.
So again, we feel like if we work on the inputs on this business and continue to grow traffic to the site, we will have a good outcome in the advertising space.
In the shareholder letter, Jeff wrote third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt, and we read through that, but as we kind of look at the trending and the pacing of the 3P business, you can see a little bit of a deceleration in the 3P sellers services line and then 3P unit slowdown might suggest that the third-party GMV expansion may not be happening quite as fast.
So again, the sellers are as important to us as anything for servicing the customers' need for price selection and convenience.
The elements I just talked about of investment, further investment in one-day shipping is directly going to be a cost that we bear and it's also going to be a direct benefit to sellers as well as the Prime eligible selection in our warehouses.
Just coming back to the Prime one-day delivery, will it be available to most of the U.S. by the holidays or by the end of the year?
And I think you had about 100 million items available for two-day delivery, Prime delivery.
Just on the grocery side of it, as you mentioned, Brian talked a bit about the Whole Foods Market growth over 500 stores, 75 metros with delivery capability, so continuing to grow that out.
And on the numbers, $800 million for the quarter, how should we think about that ramping into the back half of the year?
The operating margin has also expanded in that time period by 320 basis points as a result of a lot of the good work on infrastructure and efficiencies that I talked about earlier in the call, because this is against a backdrop of a very large expansion of our tech teams and our sales teams that supports this business.
We're really going to have to see how it goes this quarter, both on our pace of selection addition and expansion of one-day, and let you know probably at the end of the quarter.
I guess somewhat along those lines or at least along the lines of growth, we saw CapEx spending and investment in capital leases decelerate to the lowest rate that it's been in several years, maybe even the lowest rate ever.
I'm sure that's not representative of what you expect growth to look like.
The business in China is going really well and we continue to see strong growth there.

And then sort of the opposite question on AWS, which has slowed a little bit can you just talk about some of the puts and takes in the AWS revenue growth this quarter versus the prior Q?
So as you can tell, we've been pretty transparent with our AWS revenue and income numbers we've been breaking it out for 2015 and we're very happy with the growth in absolute dollar terms and we're seeing a pick up from customers and their usage, their increased pace of enterprise migrations, increased adoption of our services especially our machine learning services.
On your question about one-day, let me update you on that, because obviously that was a big topic of conversation last quarter and you can see that it's starting to show up in our results in Q2.
We expect to see continued ramp of the one-day selection availability for the next few quarters both in North America and international.
The initial two-day Prime shipping offer that we launched many years ago, the great expansion of our network to include FBA merchants and capacity for them and more recently, the first steps to increase one-day and same day although on a much smaller scale.
We have seen lower ASP generally in Q2, higher unit growth versus revenue growth in North America and we could be that we're mixing into some lower ASP items as we launch one-day, but we haven't drawn that total conclusion yet.
In particular on Prime Day, I think you'll see that we had -- over in the press release, we had more than $2 billion of products were bought from small and medium-sized businesses.
So, we think there's a lot of shared purpose there and a good quarter where we're looking forward to the Diwali holiday this year.
And the other thing I would point out on the trajectory is that, we're just getting started in international and most of that work is ahead of us although the speed that tick up a bit in Q1 -- excuse me Q2 but -- and will do even more so in Q3 in future quarters.
Hey Brian could you talk a little bit about the elasticity you're seeing -- you expect to see in international markets with the rollout of one-day?
But we think the biggest elasticity is probably in North America where the standard has been 2-day shipping for Prime.
I do want to add one point though because when we talk about operating income in both in Q2 and Q3 and we talk about the cost and penalty of one-day, I would like to highlight there's some other investment areas that are certainly going on here.
So yes -- sorry, the operating margin in AWS, just like the revenue rate it's such a rapidly growing business with different timing of investments and global expansion in investment in marketing and other infrastructure that is going to vary quarter-to-quarter.
But I would say that we are attributing a good bit of the revenue growth acceleration from 17% in Q1 to 20% in Q2 to the rollout of one-day and the impact of that.
If there's other things, obviously, we continue to add selection and we have again lots of engagement points of customers through Prime Benefits and video and devices that certainly contribute to our revenue run rate in our retention of Prime members.
But if we're going to point to one thing in Q1 that's different -- Q2 excuse me, that's different it was obviously the start of the -- and the step up in one-day shipments.
But my main question is just looking ahead of the holiday period given some of the moving parts and 3PL and shipping ecosystem and then of course with the transition to one-day, are you confident that there is enough capacity from your own first-party logistics as well as third-party partners to meet that seasonal demand and should we now expect a faster ramp in Amazon Air as the means to move cargo between fulfillment centers?
A lot of good work went into Prime Day, a lot of benefit for customers, a lot of benefit for our selling partners, the small business merchants as well.
We certainly have a lot of areas where we continue to invest not the least of which is our AWS business, devices, video, the global expansion of a lot of our Prime Benefits and things like stores and grocery delivery through Whole Foods, Prime Now and AmazonFresh.
Now the first part of your question, in terms of geographical mix, I mean, fair to assume that like a lot of our business, advertising in the North America segment is the bigger piece of that, but I think we're really excited about the international opportunity.

amazon,q3,2019,"Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve got a great new device lineup you may have seen announced in September and on the AWS side, weÃ¢ÂÂre looking forward to our re:Invent Conference in Las Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees.
Brian, I just wanted to ask you kind of more broadly about Prime One Day, what your biggest learnings have been so far over the past several months as youÃ¢ÂÂve been increasing availability?
So as we head into Q4, weÃ¢ÂÂve added whatÃ¢ÂÂs just nearly a $1.5 billion penalty in Q4 year-over-year for the cost of shipping, which is essentially transportation costs, the cost of expanding our transportation capacity, things like adding additional poles and shifts in our warehouses, the cost for deploying inventory closer to customers, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of tangential costs, by and a way the biggest expenses is on the actual transportation cost.
We continue to feel really good about not only the top line, but also the bottom line in that business, but we are investing a lot more this year in sales force and marketing personnel, mainly to handle a you know wider group of customers, an increasingly wide group of products, we continue to add thousands of new products and features a year, and we continue to expand geographically.
So the biggest impact that we saw in Q3 year-over-year in the AWS segment was tied to costs related to sales and marketing year-over-year and also to a secondary extent, infrastructure, which if you look at our capital leases or equipment leases line, it grew 30% on a trailing 12-month basis in Q3 of this year and that was 9% last year.
Can you just sort of talk to some of the steps, you have to take over the next one to two years to get the One Day shipping costs closer to what they used to be for Two Day, and how do you think about how long itÃ¢ÂÂs going to take?
We know we have temporary costs in the short run as we do things like forward deploy inventory, get greater inbound into those warehouses, set up new Amazon Logistics, AMZL capacity, staff you know multiple shifts, so that we can have later pull times to hit One Day cut-offs, things like that, adding sort centers.
But in the long run weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have a combination both of our own capacity, certainly fueled by helps with third party carriers, large carriers that weÃ¢ÂÂve used in the past.
But on the cost side, yes itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be the route density and other things will improve over time and get our cost structure down, but for now, there is certainly some start-up paying in adding new capacity.
In the past that pointed to investments in technology teams and thatÃ¢ÂÂs certainly part of it, but by in a way the biggest driver this time is the people that weÃ¢ÂÂre adding for fulfillment and transportation roles, especially as we head into Q4 and add this additional transportation capacity to service One Day. So Brian, IÃ¢ÂÂm wondering if you can weigh in on the puts and takes on the long-term potential margin for AWS?
And we also see a point out that you know increasingly what weÃ¢ÂÂre doing is renegotiating or negotiating incremental price decreases for customers who then commit to us long term.
So we do attribute it to One Day. So you know there has been some reduction in the threshold for some lower ASP items that weÃ¢ÂÂve been doing separately over the last six months that have spurred some sales in lower ASP items, but we think that is again the right decision for customers, especially over the long term.
But again in your question on enterprise penetration, you know I think the enterprise, weÃ¢ÂÂre making great progress there.
So I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs largely what dictates our roadmap and making sure that we give ourselves autonomy and availability to look to new areas and stay on the cusp of whether itÃ¢ÂÂs kind of emerging technologies or really just our customer needs or pain points that need to be solved.
But our focus is really on ensuring that weÃ¢ÂÂve got capacity from available resources, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs our own or our great carrier partners to be able to serve the small and medium-sized businesses in the 3P realm, but also the first party items that we are receiving orders from customers, making sure weÃ¢ÂÂre able to deliver those things quickly and reliably.
Just wondering back on the shorter holiday season, do you think thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a headwind for overall online sales in the quarter, anything specific to Amazon?
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in todayÃ¢ÂÂs press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
And can you also just help us understand how thatÃ¢ÂÂs playing into your operating income guidance for 4Q?

amazon,q4,2019,"Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Just on the AWS business, as you look sort of at the strength that you saw in the quarter particularly represented by the amount of dollars added quarter-over-quarter, is there anything in particular that you would call out either in terms of specific types of workloads, regions, specific customer types, that you felt like drove the strength particularly relative to the directional -- direction of growth that we were seeing in the earlier parts of the year?
I think it's been pretty broad-based, and it's kind of the culmination of a lot of work on adding new products and features, adding to our sales and marketing teams, and having better penetration in enterprise customers and hitting a lot of very different industries.
We also think that there's a real network effect when you use AWS with the millions of active customers and tens of thousands of global partners.
So, I think it's the combination of increased sales support, more and better products that hit customers' needs, and also the geographic expansion is what you're seeing.
So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our one-day delivery program as we move through the year.
So, a lot of good momentum there built up on the aggregation of benefits that we continue to add to the Prime program most recently the one-day -- expansion of one-day shipping.
I talked more in 2018 when the margins in AWS were closer to 30% about the efficiency of infrastructure spend and -- versus prior years.
But what you're seeing probably more in the margins is the expansion of our sales and marketing effort at some of those costs as well as price decreases and longer-term contracts that we've signed with some of our customers.
As far as competitive set is concerned, we -- again, we think that we have -- start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of investment not only in capacity, but also in services and features that we provide to customers.
As you said, I think as we mentioned this in the release, we're definitely continuing to improve the experience in India for customers and sellers, excited by some of the response we've seen.
That team over there continues to do a great job locally of taking a lot of the tenants that we've had at Amazon around innovation building and really run with that over there and done a great job of coming up with some interesting and new services and features that I think are specific to that region.
Just, the first one Brian, I think on one of the media interviews, you talked about how you're becoming more efficient with one-day and you continue -- with next-day delivery and continue to do so and talked about $1 billion of cost in that current quarter.
We had talked about last year about an initial step up in cost of close to $800 million in the second quarter.
It means that there'll be a step up as we grow and expand on a volume basis and then we'll see where our rates are on actually delivering and fulfilling one day.
When we started this, again, Q2 of last year, we also had abrupt change to our fulfillment network in that, when it's tuned for two-day delivery on the most part when you move to one-day in a lot of cases, it's advantageous from a cost and transportation standpoint to have that inventory closer to the customer.
And we'll look ahead and see a step-up in that this year as we start to build more capacity for the one-day.
So, I would say that just as we've had other shocks to our warehouse system over the years from going to -- from media to almost every product you can imagine, to having a cycle of increased third-party presence in the FBA program now to one-day, we have a history here where we can look for opportunities to be more efficient and lower the -- any cost penalties as we move forward.
And then the second part would be what does that mean in terms of the way you're thinking about forward CapEx cycles for the AWS business, if you're assuming useful life is moving out maybe than prior assumptions?
The other item was Diwali timing, the Indian holiday which has a very large swing factor on international revenues is, it moved more into the third quarter this year versus -- in 2019 versus 2018.
I think we continue to see some good growth in the third-party business.
And then on transportation I think you saw the outbound shipping costs to grow around 43% year-over-year.
Q2 of last year, we started to again make larger investments, particularly in one day.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in todayÃ¢ÂÂs press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
Our first question is coming from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed.
We did pledge to invest $1 billion to help digitize traders and those micro and small businesses across India.
Thanks for taking my question.
Thanks for taking the question guys.
Some other things like posts, which helps customers discover products and brands.
I think broadly with advertising, so much of this is about having -- developing great relationships with these advertisers, because I think they appreciate the fidelity we can provide around shopping outcomes.
I mean, it doesn't seem like much just given the better results and in online sales and retail third-party seller services.
The net result was a pull forward of some purchases by Japanese customers into Q3 and also some negative elasticity effects post October 1.
Our final question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

amazon,q1,2020,"This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration of the spread of the pandemic, actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, work force staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures, our ability to continue operations in affected areas, and consumer demand and consumer spending patterns as well as the impact on suppliers creditors and third party sellers all of which are uncertain.
Many of our AWS products are helping in the government response to the crisis, and are there for customers who are seeing their own demand spikes, companies enabling video conferencing, remote learning and online health services, for example.
The first one, is the current situation is, sort of I think, in many ways sort of showcase the ability of your network to provide goods for people and the value of Prime and Amazon to customers.
Then the second one, I know there's a lot of changes going on in logistics and things, but Amazon is always a learning company.
I think they are handling the additional demand, and it gives it gives people a good time and reason to use all of their Prime benefits that maybe they hadn't used as much in the past.
And again, in what individual industries are seeing right now, things like videoconferencing, gaming, remote learning, entertainment all are seeing much higher growth and usage.
On the fulfillment efficiency, I think you were talking about one day, probably is the heart of your question, when we will get back to what we have seen and levels of one day.
And what we're seeing is, we pretty much spent about that same amount because it's - in the old days, we would have perhaps had the option to ship things two-day, three-day, four-day and seen a break on rates for the actual shipment.
We will continue to moderate our marketing in the time period when we have, again, very much the demand we are trying to fulfill is there and there's some products that are still out of stock.
And then the other thing that I would just point out is the - remember the impact of a change in the useful life of our servers, mostly hitting in the AWS business that was a $800 million benefit year-over-year in Q1.
Yes, just to add to that too, is I think about $800 million or nearly $100 million benefit in the first quarter, we do expect the change to the decrease as the year progresses some.
So it's not isolated like you can see for physical stores, but we have seen an increased demand in online grocery shopping and we have a number of ways for customers to do that.
Justin, I think the changes we've seen in the digital offerings will make people customer to those benefits and maybe advance their knowledge of what's available through - music, video, Alexa, certainly communication features on our devices.
Demand has been strong, the biggest questions we have in Q2 are more about ability to service that demand and that is the products that people are ordering in a full way, not blocking or making it hard to find non-essential items, increasing marketing, and everything else.
So, Brian, I think the third-party unit mix de-indexed a little bit as a percentage of the total this quarter.
I think there's still supply chain concerns on a lot of PPE, not only that we use, but also that we sell to customers, things like masks.
Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO, Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events rate of growth of the internet online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
And with our seller community and our suppliers, what we generally have experienced getting ready for spikes in demand for known events, like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods.
Amazon Flex is supporting food banks by donating delivery services of groceries to serve 6 million meals in Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC, with plans to ramp this up to 25 cities across the U.S. And Alexa is helping customers access important CDC guidance, and help them evaluate their own COVID-19 risk levels.
While customer demand remains high the incremental revenue we are seeing on many of the lower ASP essential products is basically coming at cost.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
First, I just wanted to ask, within the $4 billion of COVID related incremental costs in Q2, you talk about spending hundreds of millions on your own testing capabilities.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC.
Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Our backlog of future contracts continues to build, and I still think the basic value proposition of AWS that we've always pointed to, things like having the most functionality, largest vibrant community of customers and partners having really proven operational and security experience.
Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.
Yes. MFN is picking up a lot of the opportunity, and sellers are taking that opportunity ship direct because then it doesn't have to come into our warehouse obviously.
But I think we have a the large portion of our advertising relates to Amazon sales, not things like travel and auto which offsite which may have been disproportionately impacted at least early on here in the COVID crisis.
