facebook,q2,2015,"We've continued to make good progress in the growth of our community with 1.49 billion people now using Facebook each month and more than 1.3 billion people using Facebook on mobile.
And when it comes to time spent across Facebook, Messenger and Instagram, people are now spending more than 46 minutes per day on average, and that doesn't include WhatsApp. This quarter, our total revenue is more than $4 billion for the first time, and advertising revenue grew by 43% year-over-year.
Now, with that in mind, I'd like to talk about how we're working on this across our current product, our next generation of apps and our long-term innovation efforts.
This quarter, we've continued to focus on improving people's experience in News Feed by making it easier to find more relevant and engaging content from friends and the entire community.
Video continues to be some of the richest and most engaging content for people and publishers, and since the start of the year, pages are also sharing more than 40% more videos.
This quarter, we updated our News Feed ranking to help people see more of the videos they care about and also began testing new options for video monetization to help our partners build their businesses.
And when it comes to serving businesses on our platform, this quarter, we continued to focus on delivering more useful tools and resources to help them achieve their goals.
With Instagram, the continued growth in the size and engagement of the community shows how this is becoming one of the best places to get a real-time snapshot of the world.
On Messenger, this quarter, we rolled out a number of new features, including mobile video calling, a new way to share locations and the option to sign up for Messenger without using a Facebook account.
We expect these improvements to continue making Messenger a more useful and engaging experience for lots of people.
We're staying focused on our three main priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of Facebook marketers and making our ads more relevant and effective.
Better, more engaging and relevant ads are good for people and marketers, and we're working hard to improve them.
As we ramp Instagram ads, we remain focused on quality and relevance to ensure the best experience for people and the highest performance for marketers.
That MAU number grew by 173 million year-over-year, and by this measure the second quarter was our strongest in terms of community growth since 2013.
And everyone has friends and family and wants to stay connected and uses a variety of tools and ways to do that in the world today, which are often very inefficient, and the Internet offers new opportunities to make that a lot better.
And I think a lot of the success that we've seen has been because of some of the work that we've done a few years back at this point in products like News Feed and I mean that team has executed really well.
I mean, there's always a richer way that people want to share and consume thoughts and ideas and I think that immersive 3D content is the obvious next thing after video.
So if you look at what the initial use cases are going to be around that, I think it's a lot of the stuff that you hear people talking about.
That said, and it's important to understand this, while we think there's a lot of interest and great opportunity, we're going to be really thoughtful and strategic about how we ramp revenue.
Instagram remains small relative to Facebook and it's going to really take time to have significant impact on our growth.
I just wanted to ask a little bit more about as you start to speak with more advertisers on the Instagram opportunity, how are you and they thinking about the differences in how they'll engage with their customers across both platforms?
And I guess what I'm getting at is do you see Instagram targeting a different type of advertiser, or do you expect people to leverage both platforms and almost think of them as kind of separate areas to budget for?
I think one of the things that's interesting about Instagram is while the ads are really visually appealing and that brings to mind certain verticals like fashion or autos, things where the visual really matters, what we're seeing is that lots of different verticals can use the platform really well.
In terms of Instagram and Facebook, we believe that marketers are looking to connect with people in a really deep way, connect with the right people, and our targeting we think is really strong compared to any other platform, at the right time.
And we see such engagement on both Facebook and Instagram along with the different targeting and ad formats, we believe we'll be able to have and are already starting to have a relationship with marketers which grow across both platforms.
Well, I think in terms of engagement the product is having, the biggest impact is News Feed continuing to do very well.
As people spend more time with News Feed, we get better about understanding what they like and getting the content that they care about in front of them.
So the playbook that we're going to run with Messenger and WhatsApp is kind of similar to how we thought about building a business in Facebook and News Feed, where if you go back to 2006 and 2007, there were a lot of people who were kind of encouraging us to just put banner ads and kind of inorganic content into the experience, and what we decided was that over the long term, the ads and monetization would perform better if there was an organic interaction between people using the product and businesses.
That we think is driving a lot of value and good content for people who are using the platform and helping a lot of businesses find customers and sell their products and grow overall.
We're working on a lot of different things that make it so that people can get value from interacting with businesses.
We have a number of other things that we're working on across Messenger and WhatsApp. But the long term bet is that by enabling people to have good organic interactions with businesses, that will end up being a massive multiplier on the value of the monetization down the road when we work on that and really focus on that in a bigger way.
And then on Instagram, just a question on kind of how we should be thinking about the ramp as well as the long term opportunity.
And again, we're going to continue to focus on the user experience, focus on the community growth and monetization will follow.
Yeah, and in terms of Instagram, I just think Kevin and the team are doing amazing work.
But I mean, the team has just done really good work in terms of ranking the content and making the experience faster and building out better ways to get feedback from our community on what kinds of content they want to see in News Feed and helping people have the tools that they need to share the social content and news and video content that they want so that way it exists in the corpus of content that can be shown.
We're excited by what we see in the e-commerce vertical and we're going to continue to invest in growing that vertical as part of our ads business.
Joining me today to talk about our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements.
Several products in the Facebook app are reaching global scale, too, now with more than 450 million people using Events each month and more than 850 million people using Groups.
Facebook has clearly become the home for global conversations about things that people care about.
Helping marketers to tell more visually engaging stories through video and carousel ads is an important focus, as well as supporting small businesses.
This quarter, we made some big improvements to the app, including upgrading our search and explore functionality and introducing trending content, which we expect will provide even more engaging experiences.
More than 700 million people now use Messenger and we've reached more than $1 billion downloads on Android.
After launching free basic services, mobile operators are seeing people adopt mobile data 50% faster than before.
We recently made changes to the Internet.org program for both developers and operators that will give more people access to even more free services.
The team recently introduced details about the full hardware and software experience that people can expect, including our new touch controllers.
I got to hear firsthand how advertising on Facebook is helping SMBs sell their products, grow their businesses, hire new employees and even expand to other cities and countries.
Using Facebook as her only marketing channel, Kelly grew her business, Krista Lee Fashion, (11:59) to over ÃÂ£3 million pounds annually and she now has 10 employees.
We're increasing our engagement with the global SMB community and have now held more than 80 local Boost Your Business events around the world, meeting thousands of businesses and getting their feedback on how we can make our products work better for them.
We also introduced a new ad format called Lead Ads, a simpler way for people to connect with companies they're interested in hearing from.
Booking.com, a Priceline Group company, is using Facebook link ads featuring Book Now button to drive reservations.
They're now expanding their use of Facebook ads across multiple markets.
Since we introduced conversion lift, which measures the direct impact that Facebook ads have on sales, we've seen adoption for marketers across verticals.
Using conversion lift, they proved that Facebook ads directly drove vehicle sales.
Entertainment company Live Nation knew that people browsed for concert tickets on mobile devices, but they were never able to measure whether they converted into sales.
This daily number represents 65% of the 1.49 billion people who used Facebook during the month of June.
Non-GAAP expense growth was primarily driven by increases in head count-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses.
Your first question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Securities.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc. I'm just wondering if there's a framework that you used to think about how much of that success is due to just the core value proposition of Facebook itself continuing to resonate with people at its most basic level as opposed to the product innovation that you've detailed in your prepared remarks or in your use cases?
Mark, I think you mentioned potentially some new options for video monetization.
I guess the question would be in your tests, have you noticed any meaningful difference in Instagram users' willingness to see or interact with ads and their News Feed as compared with an average Facebook user, recognizing that probably Instagram's audience is more geared toward some of the developing markets in the U.S. relative to Facebook?
Your next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
And you heard on this call me give a few examples of where we're already able to connect what happens in terms of ads with real sales of real products.
And you heard my Live Nation example earlier where we are able to connect Facebook ads and our platform directly to ticket sales.
So e-commerce is one of our top categories of advertisers, and we are already driving a lot of product sales through Facebook but importantly, our e-commerce initiatives are really about connecting consumers with marketers so that they can buy from companies.
When you think about mobile app install ads, those are an important but relatively small part of our revenue.

facebook,q3,2015,"Joining me today to talk about our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
1.39 billion people now use Facebook on mobile devices, including more than 1 billion on Android.
50 million people also use Facebook Lite, our app for people on low bandwidth connections and one of our fastest-growing interfaces.
This is a great sign for how our mobile strategy continues to make progress across markets, devices and platforms.
This quarter, total revenue reached $4.5 billion and advertising revenue grew by 45% from a year ago.
Another way we're working to improve people's experiences on Facebook is by helping them to share many different types of content with different groups of people they care about.
On average, there are now more than 8 billion daily video views on Facebook and more than 500 million people who are watching daily.
To offer even more engaging video experiences, we've added live video to our Mentions app for public figures, and we now support interactive 360 videos in News Feed.
More than 80 million photos are now shared on Instagram every day, and the pace of adoption among public figures, organizations and people around the world continues to grow really well.
One example is M, a digital assistant we introduced this quarter that over time will use AI to help people complete tasks.
As we rolled out the program, we've made a number of improvements based on feedback from communities and partners, including opening up our platform for free basic services to all developers who want to build.
Meanwhile, our work on new technologies to connect people in the most remote regions continues to make progress.
Facebook Pages are already the mobile solution for millions of businesses.
Instagram ads are now available in all countries where we offer Facebook ads, and marketers can manage campaigns across both platforms with the same targeting.
Video on Facebook gives marketers not just mass reach, but better cross-device targeting and measurement than we believe is available on any other platform.
Over 1.5 million small businesses posted video, which includes organic video posts and video ads on Facebook in the month of September alone.
We recently introduced target rating point, TRP, buying so that marketers can plan, buy and measure video ads on Facebook the same way they do on TV.
Products like carousel ads and dynamic product ads help improve effectiveness for marketers.
I want to take a moment to thank our clients around the world for their continued partnership and congratulate our global Facebook teams on great execution.
Echoing Mark and Sheryl's comments, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook.
This daily number represents 65% of the 1.55 billion people who used Facebook during the month of September.
In September, approximately 1.39 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 23% from last year.
These factors will have a less significant impact on the reported price-volume metrics going forward now that a full year has elapsed since the redesign of right-hand column ads, and now that mobile impressions have grown to become the majority of impressions.
Just to share one example, American Express working with Digitas, rolled out carousel ads on Instagram that targeted travel-related interest groups for people who are 18 years and older.
So what we're actually seeing is that a lot of the best or at least from my perspective, TV shows that we see folks like Jimmy Fallon breaking up their show into clips that they can now share to be consumed over social media and on the Internet in three-minute to five-minute or seven-minute segments which are more of what people want when browsing through News Feed.
The current market of trying to help people share and experience all these shorter form clips is massive.
Mark, can you talk a little about what factors and metrics you consider when you're thinking about a multi-app strategy versus rolling out more products and offerings on Facebook?
Just as Mark said with Groups, Events are growing quickly on Facebook.
So the follow-up question that I would have is how do you think you could best partner with the media providers and convince them the merits of bringing their valuable, in some cases expensive, content into the Facebook world, particularly at a time in media when they're really trying hard to guard their own existing ecosystems?
We're working hard in the direct response area, rolling out things like carousel ads and dynamic product ads.
On video, yeah, right now the strength in our system is definitely through helping people discover content that they hadn't really asked for through News Feed.
So I guess the question is, what kind of lift in ROI and overall budget do you see as e-commerce or travel marketers migrate from your first few products, like custom audiences and other to DPA?
And are the yields that you're getting from DPA ads higher than other formats like video and app downloads and those types of things?
The final question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Over the next few years, video is going to be some of the most engaging content online, and by continuing to innovate here, we have a chance to build the best place to watch and share videos.
This quarter, we continued to focus on helping marketers achieve results while using our ad product, including video and carousel ads as well as on Instagram, and as usual, Sheryl is going to talk more about this in a moment.
I just want to thank the entire Facebook community, our employees, our partners and our shareholders for helping us to continue moving forward.
Our results show that we continue to make progress on our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
With more than 45 million active SMB Pages on Facebook, we think there's a lot of opportunity to turn even more of these businesses into marketers.
Marketers come to Facebook and Instagram because we have the best performing mobile ad products, and video is making them even better.
Looking forward, we're going to stay focused on our priorities to continue to build a solid foundation for our long-term business.
We remain focused on growing the number of people who use our services, increasing advertiser demand and improving the quality and relevance of our ads.
We are pleased with the growth and engagement of our community and the momentum in our business, which together support our ability to continue investing to build our next generation of services and execute on our mission of connecting the world.
Once we start getting a bit further along with that, then the next thing that we think is going to be huge is video and immersive experiences, both things that people can create, like the social content that they share on Facebook today, and more professional and premium content both short form and longer form.
Then when they're starting to get to be more units, just like every other major computing platform before that, what we expect is that a large portion of what people do in it will be communication and social behavior, and that's where Facebook really has the DNA and experience to, I think, build the best experiences.
So Instagram ads, now that we've rolled out as we have this past quarter and gotten to a really good product offering, combined the creative format of Instagram which is very visually compelling and has a lot of engagement from people with the back-end infrastructure and marketer base that Facebook has.
On ad load, we have a lot of experience rolling out ads into feed-based products and we monitor it very carefully and we're going to continue to monitor really carefully.
And so, for us, what we really want is people to experiment and learn and get to experience Instagram as they have on Facebook so that we can make the case that we can improve the ROI and then we believe if you look at the consumer metrics of where people were spending their time, we will be able to gain share compared to almost anything else you can buy out there.
But some of Ã¢ÂÂ the vast majority of the content that's consumed on Facebook just talking about video right now is people browsing through feed.
Because there are a lot of really big and important Chinese companies who sell a lot of products to people outside of China, and they use Facebook as one of their primary tools in a lot of cases to spread information about what they're doing and grow their customer base.
In the medium-term, we're focused on those next generation of services, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. And in the long-term, we've got the investments we're making and things like artificial intelligence, VR, and obviously the Internet.org efforts that Mark just spoke about.
So one of the big opportunities that I'm really excited about right now is I think that there's a pretty big opening between very private messaging, the one-on-one messaging products like Messenger and WhatsApp, and products like Facebook where you share with all your friends at once or Instagram.
And in between there, what we're seeing is this huge growth of private groups, right, and Groups remains one of the I think least talked about products on Facebook.
And the amount that people want to share and communicate is boundless and that's I think partially why we're seeing the growth that we are with so many of these products.
1.5 million SMBs have not posted or created video on any other platform, but with us it's cheap, it's very easy to use and that gives us a way to continue to work with SMBs and increasingly grow our business with them.
Looking forward, we continue to feel like there are good opportunities to grow the business.
But it's important to keep in mind that there are a few different reasons why people share content on Facebook, and that's just one of the use cases, right?
So that's certainly been helpful in terms of making News Feed even more engaging and we'll continue to be focusing on a number of initiatives, public content and just sharing with your friends.
When you look at ad quality, I think when Facebook started, Sheryl, you were really adamant that you were focused on improving the ad quality and really making sure you were serving the highest quality ad to the right person.
The quality is really important to us because your experience on Facebook or Instagram is about the quality of what you see, both in terms of the organic posts you see from your friends or public people you're following and the ads as well.
And a lot of, I think, what we need to do is give people a way to see all of the videos that page that they like or follow is interested in sharing on Facebook.
The next big use case that we've really been working on for a couple of years now and I think is going to Ã¢ÂÂ is starting to roll out and is growing quickly is people finding content on Facebook.
So I think that that's going to be a really big deal for improving the experience of reading news on Facebook and it's something that we've been working on for a while, and I'm very excited about it.
So, yeah, I would expect that we will see an expansion of sharing and consumption of all of the different types of things that you asked about: news, video, search and the different experiences there, and these are some of the big areas that we're investing in and they're long-term investments and they're big investments and we're going to keep on pushing on them, but I think that's what we need to do to serve our community well and ultimately connect everyone in the world.
",55.61,0.95770305
facebook,q4,2015,"Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
More than 1.59 billion people now use Facebook each month and 1.04 billion every day, a growth of nearly 200 million people monthly and a 148 million people daily this year.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve continued to make progress and now 100 million hours of video are watched daily on Facebook.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been testing new experiences like suggested videos which enables people to discover more videos they might be interested in.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre also exploring ways to give people a dedicated place on Facebook for when they just want to watch videos.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve improved Facebook Lite to offer better experience in low-bandwidth environments, improving load times and adding features like video.
More than 50 million small businesses now use pages on Facebook and people post more than 2.5 billion comments on these pages each month.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve also worked to develop new experiences to give people more options for creating and sharing different types of content.
More than 800 million people now use Messenger monthly and in 2015 we grew that number by almost a quarter of 1 billion while also increasing engagement.
We continue to give people new ways to communicate by introducing video calling and new options for customizing conversations with fun things like colors and emojis and by using apps like -- using apps, the Messenger platform.
We think this is an important step towards creating and even more ubiquitous product without affecting our plans for building WhatsApp into important business in the coming years.
Finally, letÃ¢ÂÂs talk about our work on new breakthrough technologies that can help connect more people to the internet and create transformative new experiences.
To share just a few other product examples, in emerging markets we launched Slideshow a video like ad experience that works with lower connection speeds and feature phones.
We introduced local awareness ads globally to help brick and mortar businesses reach people near their stores and started testing Canvas ads to help marketers showcase their products in a more immersive way.
Our measurement tools like Conversion Lift and the Facebook pixel prove to marketers that weÃ¢ÂÂre driving business results and help make our ads more relevant.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan.
And we started some early small tests around f8 last year where with some ecommerce services made it so that people who were buying things could follow up with the business and get customer support and buy more things.
Just wondering how the business is trending thus far in the quarter or maybe by market U.S., Europe Asia-Pacific and Rest of World; and generally, just how Facebook is positioned if the global macro environment softens a bit?
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the initial marketer folks who we think are going to be most interested from the early VR experiences, especially at some of the higher price points.
We believe both Facebook and Instagram have this combination of an ability to do great creative with the best targeting in a most sophisticated measurement which shows businesses how we help them move products off shelves.
So, the way we need to drive sales around the world is by understanding markets, launching things like click to missed call ads in India and making sure our products work for market but also being able to connect to those advertising metrics and business metrics around the world.
The good news is that weÃ¢ÂÂre getting great results like the Halo 5 example I shared in my remarks that when people are willing to experiment, this is a pretty unique canvas.
First, I know a year ago you gave us usage update and time spent, wondering if video or any other products are having a big impact on usage and if you can give us any metrics there.
IÃ¢ÂÂm just wondering if you think Facebook could monetize better than other forms of media based on time spent or maybe a little bit below.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve done a bunch of work with Nielsen to measure what happens when marketers do big TV campaigns and do campaigns that are broadly, broadly targeted on Facebook.
So for the most part when people are doing big campaigns, theyÃ¢ÂÂre doing them across multiple platforms and we think that will continue.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs for Mark or Sheryl, IÃ¢ÂÂm wondering what is your strategy for professional video content going forward.
What weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing is that users are generating a lot of really high quality content, often pretty short form that people are really happy to consume.
And I wonder if youÃ¢ÂÂve had that same had conversation with your engineers when you think about these two messaging platforms that you have that got a large number of users and clearly globally weÃ¢ÂÂve seen this massive shift of the words messaging, the interest is changed now, people have engaged with it.
Operator, it looks like we have time for one last question.
But itÃ¢ÂÂs important to consider not just our business results but also how weÃ¢ÂÂre improving the lives of people and communities around the world.
In 2016 and beyond, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue doing that by serving our community, working to bring connectivity to billions of people whoÃ¢ÂÂre not yet connected, and building new technologies that give people more ways to express themselves.
Now, letÃ¢ÂÂs talk about how weÃ¢ÂÂve continued working to do that and letÃ¢ÂÂs start with how weÃ¢ÂÂre improving our existing products and businesses.
Video is an important part of the Facebook experience, and continuing to invest here is important for allowing people to share and consume some of the most engaging content.
With other parts of our core, weÃ¢ÂÂve continued to focus on improving the performance and quality of our products to better serve different communities on Facebook.
And when it comes to serving businesses, weÃ¢ÂÂve continued to focus on creating better ads and tools for our more than 2.5 million active advertisers.
Later this year, weÃ¢ÂÂll be testing new ways for people to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organizations that they want to hear from.
So, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue investing to deliver more great results over the long-term.
And thatÃ¢ÂÂs what I think about every day as we continue building Facebook.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre also pleased with the growth weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in emerging markets and countries like China where businesses are advertising on Facebook and Instagram to reach people internationally.
We continue to make progress on our three priorities, capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
With over 1.44 billion people using Facebook on mobile monthly and over 400 million monthly actives on Instagram, Facebook and Instagram have become the two most important mobile advertising platforms.
So we see a big opportunity to continue to grow the number of Facebook advertisers going forward.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre also very pleased with the growth in advertiser adoption of Instagram and the positive results advertisers are seeing from their investments.
In the full year 2015, capital expenditures were $2.5 billion as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure, and office facilities to support the rapid growth of the business.
Our performance reflects the strong growth and engagement of our community, the momentum weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in our ads business, and significant progress weÃ¢ÂÂre making on our mission to connect the world.
First Mark, just on Messenger and WhatsApp, can you just talk more about the takeaway on the Messenger platform now that itÃ¢ÂÂs been open for nearly a year to developers and how thatÃ¢ÂÂs informed your view on what youÃ¢ÂÂre going to do with WhatsApp going forward?
WeÃ¢ÂÂre seeing more and more advertisers move to mobile; they realize that itÃ¢ÂÂs no longer question of whether they need to be on mobile, but itÃ¢ÂÂs really how theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to be on mobile, and we think weÃ¢ÂÂve got the best solution for that and weÃ¢ÂÂre investing to make it even better.
But overall, I mean the reason why weÃ¢ÂÂre interested in this as the social company is that we think that this is going to be a new way that people interact.
And giving a focused experience for the person who wants to run their business through Facebook and be communicating with their customers all day long, thatÃ¢ÂÂs just proven to be an incredibly engaging experience that drives content into the system and is good overall.
We have introduced a number of things like that for public figures, for groups, messengers, probably been the most successful; itÃ¢ÂÂs something thatÃ¢ÂÂs connected to the Facebook experience that now has more than 800 million people using it.
In terms of monetizing time spent, itÃ¢ÂÂs certainly the case that consumers have shifted to mobile and businesses need to catch up.
The exact [ph] percentage we can monetize that weÃ¢ÂÂll see, but we certainly think that we will continue to benefit from the consumer shift to mobile, because businesses are behind.
And we think that thatÃ¢ÂÂs just really important to the mission of the company and weÃ¢ÂÂll increasing engagement and sharing and openness, and all of the things that we care about.
Two questions, Sheryl, could you just talk about political advertising and how you think about the attractiveness of -- and any anecdotes you have on Facebook as a platform for political campaign?
In terms of the election, itÃ¢ÂÂs important to note that weÃ¢ÂÂre large and diversified, so no one vertical drives our business.
So there was a long time where people thought that our business might not be as good because we had no ads on mobile, and that was because we always prioritized the experience for people above, even if itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a painful thing for the company.
First, you build a great consumer experience that helps people share in a new way thatÃ¢ÂÂs really important.
And thatÃ¢ÂÂs how we think about stuff and weÃ¢ÂÂll do that in all of our products and the different things that we do going forward.

facebook,q1,2016,"A lot of what we're building today in areas like connectivity, artificial intelligence, and virtual and augmented reality may not pay off for years, but they're important to our mission of connecting the world.
Over the next three years, we're going to keep investing in our most developed ecosystem, the Facebook app and platform.
Today, people around the world spend on average more than 50 minutes a day using Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet.
Our team has just worked day after day on lots of improvements over a long period of time, and that progress continued in the first quarter.
We launched Reactions to help people express themselves in more ways, and we improved our products to work on different mobile networks and devices all over the world.
Over the next five years, we're going to build ecosystems around our products that are already being used by a lot of people.
And to get there, we're building technology that brings people together and that helps everyone in the world share anything they want with anyone.
We're pleased with the progress we made in Q1 across our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
On the supply side, we continue to see healthy growth in the number of people using Facebook, time spent across our products, and ad loads.
Our results reflect healthy growth and engagement in our community, strength in our ads business, and investments we're making to capitalize on the long-term opportunities we see ahead.
I wanted to come back to your comments on the small and medium-sized business opportunity at Facebook, maybe direct a few points to Sheryl to get some comment.
I wanted to understand what some of the opportunities are to continue to demonstrate to those advertisers what the potential is for both Facebook and maybe even Instagram and Facebook Messenger long term as platforms to grow their businesses and also pointing out what some of the measurement tools and operating challenges are to bring people onto the platform.
We then work on helping them use our ad products and upsell them to our paid ad products as well, and we announced this quarter that we hit 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and 200,000 on Instagram.
And that enables people to use Facebook in a very direct to response way, and we'll continue to invest there.
And then the next step is to create organic activity around public entities, so whether that's businesses, public figures like athletes and celebrities and types of folks that people want to interact with on these different platforms, and we did that on Facebook in News Feed group pages, and we're working on a number of different ways to do that in Messenger.
So that's one way that I think you're going to see bots work, between people who are actually driving the businesses directly will need to in some way train or answer questions for people, but we can build artificial intelligence that can learn from people how to automate a lot of that and make that experience a lot faster for people who want to interact with businesses and public figures.
The APAC question, it has been growing really well for several quarters now, and we're seeing a lot of great adoption as people learn to use the products.
And that's our job, is to make it so that we build great tools that people Ã¢ÂÂ everyone around the world can share anything that they want with everyone.
Now the other thing that's also true is that people want to share with lots of different kinds of audiences.
But we're also investing in things like Messenger and WhatsApp because a lot of people want to share increasingly messages privately one on one or with very small groups.
So in addition to Messenger, which is at 900 million people a month, and WhatsApp, which is at more than 1 billion people a month, Facebook Groups is also at more than 1 billion people a month, which I think represents the increasing diversity of the different types of audiences that people want to share with.
Over time, we would expect that ad load growth will be a less significant factor driving overall revenue growth, but we remain confident that we've got opportunities to continue to grow supply through the continued growth in people and engagement on Facebook as well as on our other apps such as Instagram.
And what we look at are what are the things that we think are going to be ubiquitous tools, and who are the most talented people in the world to build this.
We think we're uniquely placed to bring people-based marketing to scale and solve the measurement problem, and the Audience Network is a place we're really focused because we feel like we're delivering value for advertisers and publishers, so we're investing behind the growth we've seen.
So what we're seeing is the results we're able to deliver on Facebook and Instagram, a lot of our marketing partners want more.
One obvious thing I think over time is if you just look at the way that we rank News Feed, today we use some basic signals like who you're friends with and what pages you like as some of the most important things for figuring out what Ã¢ÂÂ out of all of the millions and millions of pieces of content that are on Facebook, what we're going to show and what are going to be the most interesting things to you.
Our focus, however, continues to be on our ad products because we think we can take people all the way from the top of the funnel, where they can really get a brand awareness or product awareness, and go all the way down to purchase, not necessarily because the purchase is happening on Facebook, but because we can work on the measurement systems to understand how the advertising, both at the top and lower down in the funnel is influencing those purchases.
And on Live video, the theme that I think is most important is just that there's so much that people want to express and share with the people around them that they don't have the tools to do today.
I also think that there are going to be a lot more interactive forms of video than just Live and 360 like we're talking about now.
So we're very excited about continuing to do our work to help unlock all the expression and connection that people want to do.
Thank you, good afternoon and welcome to Facebook's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements.
Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
In recent weeks, we're also consistently seeing more than 1 billion people using Facebook on mobile every day.
But because we were a controlled company, we were able to focus on improving the user and product experience of our apps first and then build a strong mobile business over time rather than being forced to do something shortsighted.
And over the years, our structure has helped us make big bets on acquisitions like Instagram that were very controversial initially but were good decisions for our community and our business.
While helping to connect the world will always be the most important thing that I do, there are more global challenges that I also feel a responsibility to help solve to create a better world for my daughter and all future generations, things like: helping to cure all disease by the end of the century; upgrading our education system so it's personalized for each student; and protecting our environment from climate change.
That's why Priscilla and I created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed to give 99% of our Facebook shares to advance human potential and promote equality.
In December, I also announced that I won't sell more than $1 billion worth of stock Ã¢ÂÂ Facebook shares per year over the next three years.
Sheryl will talk more about this in a minute, but now more than 3 million businesses are using our advertising products every month.
Between Messenger and WhatsApp, people send around 60 billion messages every day, and that's almost three times as many messages as SMS handled at its peak.
We hear from marketers that figuring out mobile today is like figuring out TV in its early days.
People are sharing and creating nearly three times more video on Facebook than they were a year ago.
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently on mobile feed than on TV.
For example, NestlÃÂ© took their TV ad for Natural Bliss coffee creamer and in less than a day edited it for mobile feed by creating a new opening and adding text overlays to relay their message without sound.
The ads were so engaging that people spent an average of 28 seconds interacting with them, and Lowe's saw a 6.7 times return on AdSense.
Last year we introduced Conversion Lift to measure how Facebook and Instagram campaigns drive business objectives like sales.
They found that combining Facebook video ads with their TV ads drove 1.5 times more conversions than TV ads alone.
Over 1.5 billion people accessed Facebook for mobile devices in March, up 21% from last year.
Mobile ad revenue grew 75%, driven by strength from Facebook's News Feed.
Importantly, as part of this proposal, the preservation of the multi-class capital structure would be generally predicated on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook.
Mark, I was hoping you could talk to us about how you expect to shift user behavior within Messenger to get users to focus more on businesses versus more personal communications and how you'll make users aware of the capabilities within the platform.
Facebook and Instagram are the two most important mobile ad platforms out there.
Thanks, a question for Mark.
On the question regarding what would happen to Mark's shares if he were to leave Facebook, I'd just refer that the new multi-class capital structure is generally dependent on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook.
At the same time, we also think that there are going to be many, many good businesses and different other social use cases where there are people doing good work and building different companies that we feel no need to own those things.
We have some great examples of Audience Networks really improving people's results.
I'll share one example of how ads are driving a small business on Facebook through ads, which is a company called Sparkle in Pink.
Great, so I guess a question for Mark or Sheryl.
And then the second question on messaging, so with WhatsApp crossing 1 billion users recently, how do you view the product roadmap today on WhatsApp versus what you showcased recently with Messenger?
Bots, very early but giving the opportunity for more personal interactions between businesses and mobile.
The 10 received APIs (56:26), so that businesses could send immediate responses to common questions, including engaging images and call to action as well as texts.
Operator, we have time for one last question.
",57.64,0.88600194
facebook,q2,2016,"At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Facebook Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call.
We're making good progress on core services within the Facebook app, like search.
Continuous steady improvement in services like search are an important part of helping people connect and realizing our mission.
In the two years since we separated Messenger from the main Facebook app, which was a pretty controversial decision at the time, we've improved performance and given people new ways to express themselves.
As of the second quarter, more than 1 million people a month are now using Oculus on mobile phones through our Gear VR partnership with Samsung.
Over 80% of new advertisers in Q2 started with simplified products like boosted posts.
Our goal is to help our clients grow their businesses, whether it be moving products off shelves, driving online sales or building their brands.
Businesses that want to build their brands need to reach a large audience with a compelling story, and they're seeing strong results from immersive formats like video and Canvas ads.
We introduced lead ads in Q1 to make it easy for people to fill out forms on mobile devices right from News Feed.
Businesses selling products are getting search like ROI from dynamic ads.
Over 300 million people see dynamic ads each month and over 2.5 billion unique products have been uploaded by marketers.
This daily number represents 66% of 1.71 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of June.
Mobile continues to drive our growth, with over 1 billion people accessing Facebook via mobile devices on an average day in June, up 22% compared to last year.
The 49% increase in total ad impressions was driven primarily by growth in ad impressions served in Facebook mobile News Feed where the majority of our ads are shown.
Remember that payments and other fees revenue largely generated from games played on personal computers, which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs. Q2 total expenses were $3.7 billion, up 33%, inclusive of $825 million of share-based compensation related expenses as well as $193 million of amortization of intangible assets.
Consequently, we anticipate lower advertising revenue growth rates in each successive quarter in 2016.
Additionally, we anticipate ad load on Facebook will continue to grow modestly over the next 12 months, and then will be a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017.
We anticipate full year 2016 capital expenditures will be approximately $4.5 billion as we invest to support the rapid growth of our business.
But I guess my question is, if targeting continues to improve along with click-through-rate and then ultimately ROI, why does ad load have to become less of a factor going forward?
Thanks for taking my question today.
But another area that's growing incredibly quickly is private messaging, right, where between Messenger and WhatsApp, I think we're around 60 billion messages a day, which I think is something like three times more than the peak of global SMS traffic.
But as we look forward into 2017, we think it'll be a less significant factor driving inventory growth.
But we still think there's opportunities to drive inventory through user growth and time spent.
Can you talk more about the revenue opportunity of bringing Facebook's targeting tools to other video publishers?
They targeted outdoor enthusiasts then retargeted people who viewed the Instagram videos with Carousel ads on Facebook that highlighted the product features.
Well, I, like everyone else, am enjoying PokÃÂ©mon Go. And the biggest thing that I think we can take away from this as we invest in augmented reality in addition to virtual reality, is that the phone is probably going to be the mainstream consumer platform that a lot of these AR features first become mainstream rather than glasses form factor that people will wear on their face.
Messenger today has 1 billion organic interactions between businesses and consumers each month.
I had two product related questions for Mark.
I would say that it's primarily driven by growth in Facebook mobile News Feed.
Over the next three years, we're focused on continuing to build our community and help people share more of what matters to them.
deliver better experiences for our community and more ways for people to share and more of what they care with anyone they want.
And in the second quarter, time spent per person increased double-digit percentages year-over-year across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet.
We've also emphasized the importance of measurements and value in driving real results for the businesses that use Facebook, and that means helping them create more relevant and engaging ads.
We're already seeing a positive impact in terms of time spent and the amount of content that people are sharing.
We've also introduced our advertising tools on Instagram and we're seeing marketers engage with people in creative and innovative ways.
We continue to focus on our three priorities, capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.
We're excited to bring more relevant video ads to people both on and off Facebook.
This means that advertisers can place video, brand video ads, not just on Facebook and Instagram, but across a network of apps and sites.
These results highlight the continued growth and engagement of our global community and the strength of our ads business as advertisers benefit from our increasingly broad and deep portfolio of targeting, creative and measurement tools.
Since ad load has been one of the important factors in our recent strong period of revenue growth, we expect the rate at which we are able to grow revenue will be impacted accordingly.
In summary, Q2 was another great quarter for Facebook, illustrated by the strong growth and engagement of our global community and continued broad-based strength of our ad business.
We're pleased with the results, and we will continue to invest in order to best position Facebook for our long-term growth opportunities.
When you think about what's happening on video on our platform, we're really excited by the production and consumption of video, and we're seeing the full range from people posting the things in their personal lives.
That said, our primary focus is on short form content, not long form content, and we're pretty excited to see the different forms of content people will create, both to share messages, to create new content and to engage audiences around the world.
We still see the opportunity to grow inventory from the growth of people and engagement on Facebook, as well as our other services like Instagram.
And so I think what you're seeing is that across all of the objectives people have from brand marketers to direct response to SMBs to developers, as our ad products get more sophisticated, our targeting and measurements get better.
They have an increased opportunity to grow, and that's why we think our growth to-date continues to be broad-based.
And we're just going to continue working on giving people the best tools across the spectrum from private to public, and across the spectrum from text-based and simple communication to richer type of media like photos, videos, and then, eventually, more immersive forms like VR.
Yeah, and Justin, in terms of ad load, we've talked about the different factors that go into it, obviously, just in driving the overall business.
One of the big growing use case is that we're investing a lot in is looking up the content in the ecosystem, and that is an area that we're very excited about, which helps people find more content.
But the opportunity to take not just video ads, but other ad formats we have, bring them to the rest of the web and other apps with our ability to target and measure, we think is a big one.
And what we're starting to see is that people are using Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network to drive their objective in a cohesive way.
So that's a really good example of how you can take targeting and the ability to target across Audience Network, Facebook and Instagram and drive people all the way down the funnel.
And one of the big themes that we're talking about here is becoming video first, right, and as people look for richer and richer ways to express themselves just like people in the past just shared a lot of text and photos on Facebook, we think that in the future more of that is going to be video.
And basically what Ã¢ÂÂ the way to think about this is that, even if a lot of your friends come from the same kind of background or have the same political or religious beliefs, if you know a couple of hundred people, there's a good chance that even maybe a small percent, maybe 5% or 10% or 15% of them will have different viewpoints, which means that their perspectives are now going to be shown in your News Feed.
So we don't think it would be a good experience in News Feed, right, because a lot of when people are finding videos on Facebook is you're scrolling through News Feed, you're looking at what story seems interesting to you, which is why we did the auto play videos so that rather than having to take an action, you can just start experiencing the video automatically and continue watching it if it's something that you're interested in.
I think people just would watch a lot less of the organic videos that were posted because of that.
But the important thing to keep in mind on this is we don't really Ã¢ÂÂ we don't need to do pre-roll because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content, you come to look at a feed and putting the ads in between the stories is a much more effective way to do it and better for the user experience.
And if we can make it so that you can have some of those interactions in an automated way where you fire off a text and then just get a response back quickly, but asynchronously so it doesn't take up your full attention, then I think that's going to be a much better experience that people really enjoy and like.
And between that and M, which is kind of our own internal bot that we're building, I think that this is going to be an interesting area to watch and encourage more interaction between people and businesses and messaging.
And part of why I think you see this is that there are just so many different ways that people want to share so many different kinds of content, ranging from text to photo to video, just richer and richer and more immersive content.
And we really believed that, and call it five years, or whatever the period of time that it takes to get there, I think most of what people consume online is going to be video.
On consumption, there are innovations that we've had like auto play in feed, but what's the next version of that, that makes it so that people can have an even more native and default video experience when they're in News Feed, as well as private areas like Messenger and WhatsApp. So I think you're going to see this across all of our apps.
And over the long-term, I think one of the big things that we need to do is see if we can not only make this good for engagement for our partners, but also a really positive business driver for them too.
",58.35,0.8451657
facebook,q3,2016,"So that's why we're prioritizing putting video first across our family of apps and taking steps to make it even easier for people to express themselves in richer ways.
Instagram Stories is a lightweight way for people to share moments of their day through photos and videos that appear in a slide show format and disappear after 24 hours.
We're already testing this in our main Facebook app with a version that has a camera, directly just one swipe away from News Feed, with creative effects for your photos and videos.
The 2016 Summer Olympics were huge on Facebook, with more than 270 million people creating 1.5 billion interactions.
Workplace is a communications platform that uses features that people know, like News Feed, groups, and messages to help them collaborate and share at work the same way that they do everywhere else.
Mary shared GM's success with Facebook mobile video ads.
In Q2, we announced that over 60 million businesses use our free Facebook Pages product each month.
For businesses operating in areas with weak network connections, we continue to build advertising tools into Facebook Lite, our low bandwidth app, and are making more of them available offline.
In Q3, we introduced tools to help businesses find people around the world who look like their current customers and target the ones most likely to convert.
Businesses can use Dynamic Ads for Retail to show people the products available at their closest location in real time and reach people likely to visit their stores.
This quarter we announced new third-party partnerships with Nielsen DataLogix, Visual IQ, and MarketShare to help our clients measure how Facebook ads drive business results.
In September, 1.18 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 172 million or 17% compared to last year.
Mobile continues to drive our growth, with 1.09 billion people accessing Facebook on mobile on an average day in September, up approximately 197 million or 22% compared to last year.
It is worth noting that desktop ad revenue grew 18%, which is higher than growth rates in recent quarters, and was aided by our efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers on advertising served via web browsers.
The reported increase in price continues to be driven by the ongoing mix shift towards mobile, where we show only higher priced feed ads.
Impression growth was primarily driven by mobile feed ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Payments and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal computers, which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs. Q3 total expenses were $3.9 billion, up 28%.
First on revenue, as I mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect that ad load will play a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017.
With a much smaller contribution from this important factor going forward, we expect to see ad revenue growth rates come down meaningfully.
Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
The first one, the past couple quarters you've given us a metric on the growth in time spent per user across the three big platforms.
Thanks for taking the questions, maybe one for Sheryl and one for Dave.
Just really reiterating what I said last quarter about our expectations on ad load going into mid-2017, it's been one of the key factors in terms of driving growth along with time spent Ã¢ÂÂ user growth and time spent growth and advertiser demand.
Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions.
And maybe a related question would be, FOX Sports and Sports Illustrated are co-producing some original content for Facebook Live.
The next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. This quarter was particularly strong for brand, are really recognizing that they can do big brand buys on our platform like they would do on TV, but make them much more targeted.
The one thing that I would say in terms of making money through Messenger is we're already driving results for businesses by letting them advertise in News Feed to open up threads in Messenger, which is different from the long-term vision that we have here around creating interactions that start in Messenger.
So they look for people that at a certain date have used specific itineraries and then created Dynamic Ads which showed the available cruises and pricing and had a Book Now button.
In the first nine months of this year, 109 million people on Facebook in the U.S. generated over 5.3 billion posts, comments, and likes and shares related to the election.
During the primaries and in September, we also added a Register to Vote link at the top of our Facebook app that we estimate helped more than 2 million people register to vote, some who were registering for the first time.
Over the next 5 years, we're going to keep building ecosystems around products that a lot of people already use every day.
We're making good progress helping businesses and marketers use Instagram in new ways, and Sheryl will talk more about that in a few minutes.
A lot of businesses use WhatsApp already, but we're going to really start working on the second phase in the next year.
While we just launched Marketplace, many millions of people have been buying and selling things in Facebook for-sale groups for a while, and we think this is going to be an important tool going forward.
Over the next 10 years, we're going to continue to invest in the platforms and technologies that will connect more people and more places and allow everyone in the world to have a voice.
We continue to focus on our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
We also have a lot of hard work to do to help our partners around the world use mobile to drive their businesses.
Our results reflected the continued growth in engagement of our community around the world and the strength of our mobile ads business.
We're pleased with the growth in time spent per DAU that we're seeing across the Facebook family of apps.
And that includes the Facebook mobile app, where we saw good year-over-year growth in time spent per DAU.
And then, Dave, as we try to digest some of the comments you made about ad load and revenue as we exit 2016, go to 2017, how should we also be thinking about the mix of ad units as you continue to see more e-commerce and video in the platform?
On local, we think this is a really big opportunity, and you see this in the large base of existing businesses using Facebook and Instagram increasingly.
And so what's happening is that people are really using the Facebook business pages and increasingly the Instagram business profile as their mobile presence, and we think that's what's working.
As the rate of growth in ad loads slows and also as you continue to enhance targeting and as more video advertisers come onto Facebook, would you expect that eCPMs will rise and offset part, if not all, of this impact of the ad loads slowing?
So if you think about what is enabling video to become huge right now, it's that fundamentally the mobile networks are getting to a point where a large enough people around the world can have a good experience watching a video.
If you go back a few years and you tried to load a video in News Feed, it might have to buffer for 30 seconds before you watched it, which wasn't a good enough experience for that to be the primary way that people shared.
And when people are ready and want video to be the primary way that they're sharing and consuming content, we're going to be there ready.
We continue to innovate on the products to make them more effective and make this a great gateway for businesses to come onto Facebook and come into mobile and spend.
A product question for Mark, in trying to Ã¢ÂÂ you're talking about some of these features and making the camera more of a central way of communicating on Facebook.
But just in terms of other features and putting the camera at centerpiece, do you think this is something that's going to be obvious to people in the next year, couple of months?
Same thing on the Messenger side, as I mentioned, these products around my day, it's a similar video medium to Instagram Stories and a similar camera to what we're building in the Facebook app as well.
And then, Sheryl, can you just talk about with video, how you see marketers using Facebook more to complement TV and what it would take to shift dollars over in a bigger way going forward?
That is a new experience that we're building, and building that as part of Facebook is a great way for people to see it and get exposure to it, and we'll see where that goes over time.
So we'll look at all those options, but for now I really think that Video Home is going to be a great experience, and I'm excited to roll that out.
So I mentioned this stat earlier that we have about 33,000 bots that are live in Messenger, including experiences across a range of verticals, from news to e-commerce to local businesses and all kinds of different things, and we're seeing some early progress.
But in the near term, what we've found is that a lot of businesses are creating ads in News Feed that then they can follow up and do transactions with people in Messenger, and I think that's going to be pretty meaningful over the next few years.
They saw a three times increase in their online bookings and I think those kind of results are made possible by more vertical-specific products, and we're going to continue to invest there.
What we basically are trying to do is work on over time adding more and more signals to the News Feed model to help us fully value what people in the community value about the different content that we show them.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. In general, what we want to do is try to understand the content that people are sharing and that's out there for them to see as best as possible.
What we're seeing in pages and marketers on Facebook is they want to both get awareness and drive all the way down to generating transactions, and Marketplace I think is going to help people do that.
",60.18,0.81668454
facebook,q4,2016,"Good afternoon and welcome to Facebook's fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings conference call.
Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's press release and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.
New Year's Eve was our biggest live moment ever, with more people going live than at any other time since we launched the product.
Instagram Stories reached 150 million daily actives just five months after the launch, and we've added new features like Boomerang and Live into Stories and I'm excited to see that continue to grow.
Last month, we introduced Dynamic Ads for broad audiences to help businesses reach new customers based on their interests on Facebook and online behavior.
1.86 billion people used Facebook during the month of December, up 269 million or 17% compared to last year.
As I have noted before, we focus on GAAP results because stock-based compensation plays an important role in how employees are compensated in our business and industry more broadly, and we view it as a real expense.
Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Curious to be Ã¢ÂÂ hear (24:39) how you think about the core use of Instagram now and how it differs from core Facebook.
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
When we think about the P&L impacts of both monetizing video and investing in video, is there anything we should be thinking about or you want to call out in terms of gross versus net on either the revenue side or the revenue share side that could be leading to mix shift to incremental revenue growth but possibly lower margin revenue coming into the business?
Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen.
May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks for taking my questions.
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Second question, and I know you'll be getting a lot of this over the next two or three months, but just any difference on trends Ã¢ÂÂ Millennials on the platform versus other cohorts or groups?
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
David, I think you just talked about these pretty material increases in MAUs. Could I ask two questions?
Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo Securities.
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Sena from Evercore ISI.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies.
Your next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt from Stifel.
Your last question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura Instinet.
Finally, we're looking for ways to grow the ecosystem of video content on Facebook.
We want people to think of Facebook as a place for interesting and relevant video content from professional creators as well as their friends.
Last year we started to invest in more original video content to help seed the ecosystem, and we're planning to do more in 2017.
If we can help people stay informed and make Facebook a better place to understand what's going on in the world, then we think that's going to make our community stronger and a more positive force for good in the world.
We're going to keep making big investments in VR content, and I'm excited about what's coming in 2017, from new games to more immersive educational experiences.
As I said in our call last quarter, we're going to continue to invest and hire aggressively to help improve our products, but also to build the infrastructure that will help us grow in the future.
We continue to focus on our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.
With only a small fraction of the businesses on Facebook and Instagram advertising, we know we have a lot of opportunity and hard work ahead.
2016 was another year of strong, profitable growth, and we continued to invest in building our business for the long term.
Mobile continues to drive our growth, with 1.15 billion people accessing Facebook on mobile on an average day in December, up 212 million or 23% compared to last year.
In Q4, the average price per ad increased 3% and the total number of ad impressions served increased 49%, driven primarily by mobile feed ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Full year 2016 capital expenditures were approximately $4.5 billion, up 78%, as we continue to invest to support the rapid growth of the business around the world.
To conclude, 2016 was a strong year for Facebook in terms of community growth, engagement, product innovation and the growth of our advertising business.
So the biggest change that I think that we're going to see on the consumption in News Feed and in the tab over the next year or two is going to be much more video inventory and content coming in as we work through and make that business model start to really click for a lot of folks.
Over the longer term, I think as that works, people will experiment with longer forms of video as well and all kinds of different things.
And then I think your question was on how the core use case between Facebook and Instagram differs.
Facebook has a mix of text and news and links and visual content like photos and videos.
So all those good and subtle decisions that Kevin has made over the years add up to creating a different kind of community that what we're finding and that's great, is that it's really complementary to what people are doing on Facebook.
And that I think speaks to how you can build these different kinds of communities with different connections in a way that really is creating new value in people's lives.
Sheryl, for you; would love to get a sense of how you think about some of the opportunities and challenges sitting ahead of the business now on monetizing all of the video that's being consumed on Facebook.
And we're seeing a lot of great examples of people using ads in the feed across Instagram and News Feed.
And so we're pretty excited about the opportunity we have in our current business, and we're going to work client by client to get the video format of those ads right, get the targeting to be as good and as deep as it can be and make sure we're measuring all the way through to sales.
And for video search Ã¢ÂÂ search is a big priority and a thing that we're working on across all of the different verticals, not just video but also all the posts on Facebook, all of the content that people are selling in Marketplace, the groups that people are joining and sharing and all the news content.
In terms of the opportunities for price, it's really just continuing to focus on making our ads better targeted, more relevant, improving all the different ways in which we can drive better outcomes for our advertisers and sort of meeting them with the results that they care about and delivering those results.
When you think about ads in Messenger, we right now are really focused on consumer growth and engagement because we know that over time that creates the monetization opportunity.
And then talking Asia, could you just comment, Mark, on China and how you think about it at long-term as a market opportunity and your level of optimism that Facebook can have a material presence in that market in 5 to 10 years?
So as I've said a number of times before, our mission is to connect everyone in the world, and it's hard to do that over the long term if we don't find a way to serve more than a billion people who live in China.
So this is something that we're going to continue engaging in and thinking about, how to move forward on, and long-term it's very important.
Kind of more like Facebook to the Instagram example that we used before, whereas WhatsApp I think is a much more utilitarian experience with a much more stark UI where there's just not as much emphasis on having a lot of different ways to engage.
So we did the experiment that you asked about before around ads and Messenger and different ways that businesses can interact and there's a lot of flexibility around how we can explore there, which is why I think you'll see more of that on the Messenger side than on the WhatsApp side in the near term.
But giving businesses the opportunity to connect in WhatsApp and reach the people that they want and eventually have increasingly, hopefully, transactional interactions I think will be a really useful thing on that platform as well.
Well, I think AI is going to be great for the experience that people have in our community.
So there's an increasing focus on objectionable content, right, and a lot of unfortunate things, right, that people share on Facebook.
So I think it's both going to be Ã¢ÂÂ AI is both going to be great on showing people content that's really good and helping us enforce the community standards that we have to make sure that everyone has a good and fair experience.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So, for the video tab, the goal that we have for the product experience is to make it so that when people want to watch videos or they want to keep up to date on what's going on with their favorite show or what's going on with the public figure that they want to follow, that they can come to Facebook and go to a place knowing that that's going to show them all the content that they're interested in.
I do think that it's going to get a lot stronger once the business model really starts to click here, right?
So having mid-roll ads, we're committed to doing this in a way that's very good on the user experience, but that is going to enable the kind of content that I think is going to take us to the next level.
Wehner - Facebook, Inc. So, Anthony, I can just take the first part of that at least, which is Ã¢ÂÂ look, our focus is on kick-starting the ecosystem here for the video tab that Mark talked about.
",59.98,0.8405573
facebook,q1,2017,"We're going to continue building new tools to keep people safe on our platform.
Over the next year, we'll be adding 3,000 people to our Community Operations team around the world on top of the 4,500 we already have today to review the millions of reports we get every week and to improve the process for doing that quickly.
Next I want to give a quick update on what we're building over our three time horizons, how we're making our core services more useful and engaging right now, how we're building ecosystems around products that a lot of people are already using over the next five years, and how we're investing in the technologies that will give more people a voice and make sharing more immersive over the next 10 years.
We want to give developers the power to build all kinds of AR tools in the camera so more people can experience augmented reality on their phone.
Over the next five years, we're going build ecosystems around our products that a lot of people are already using.
As people share more video, as we explore more things like augmented reality, and as we build more tools to keep our community safe, we're going to keep investing aggressively in the infrastructure that we need to grow and serve our community.
For example, adidas, which is how you pronounce them at their headquarters, and its agency, iProspect, created a video highlighting the innovative future of a Z.N.E. It's still early for this new format, but it's a great example of how we can deliver innovative mobile experiences that work for advertisers and work for people.
We're excited about the growing adoption of our platforms, and we're going to continue to invest in helping businesses and people connect.
I wanted to understand what you're seeing in terms of the development of the community on the user growth side, the engagement side, as well as on the monetization side with respect to breadth of advertisers and ad product evolution, what that means for Instagram's future and how it compares to maybe what you've learned growing the business on the Facebook side over the last couple years.
In terms of the development on the advertising side, we're not specifically breaking out Instagram revenue, as you know, because that's sold through the same Facebook ad interfaces, but we're seeing really good contribution and good growth there.
And I think what that shows is the power of the very sophisticated targeting we offer across our platforms along with really the ability to use very simple tools like a phone to create very sophisticated but visually compelling ads.
Mark, first just on the video strategy, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how that's evolving in terms of the type of content that you're licensing and featuring within the Facebook Video tab, and then if you have any more clarity just on how the economics are going to work there around revenue share and gross margins.
And obviously, we're going to be in an area where we're sharing revenue with content providers, so it's going to have a different margin profile than core Facebook News Feed from an expense profile perspective.
Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Can you just talk about some of the biggest trends you're monitoring and what you're most excited about as you think about ways to monetize Messenger over the next two or three years?
The first thing that we need to do on Messenger and WhatsApp is get a lot of businesses using it organically and build the behavior for people that they reach out to businesses for different things, like customer support or for getting news content, things that may not eventually be the big business use cases but establish the behavior of people interacting not only with their close friends, but also with businesses.
And once we get that to a big base, then there are going to be a lot of opportunities to build a business, and the business will be proportional to the amount of that activity that people want to do organically.
So for a while, our strategy has been to just continue building as good tools as we can because no matter how many people we have on the team, we're never going to be able to look at everything.
On that front, we're focused on building out the best video experiences for our community and growing longer-form content as a priority.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. Yes, we know that measurement is so critical, and we really want to measure core business results and focus on becoming the number one growth driver for our clients.
But there are also going to be all these new kinds of things that we're not even building today that developers will be able to experiment with.
So there are lots of different ways that over time this kind of content is going to both augment existing real-world objects and eventually replace them, which I think is going to be an interesting opportunity.
And do you think longer term the video consumption is going to be in that dedicated tab, or will it stay in the News Feed based on what you're seeing right now?
What people do with News Feed a lot of the time is they have a few free minutes, or you want to sit down for maybe a longer session to see everything that's going on in the world.
I think you're going to start in the future getting people coming to Facebook for the News Feed use case of checking in and people coming with an intent to go to the video tab to watch a specific video.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So I think your basic point is right, that the reason why we started working on Marketplace and the tab around that is because when we were exploring what the biggest use cases were of Groups, we uncovered that a very large number of people, hundreds of millions, use Groups to buy and sell different things.
It's really early both in terms of testing the ads and getting any feedback from users, so people who use Facebook, so we don't have that data to share.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So in terms of experimenting with different content, I think we'll try a number of different things here.
But again, like Dave said before, the goal is going to be creating some anchor content initially that helps people learn that going to the video tab that that's a great destination where they can explore and come to Facebook with the intent to watch the videos that they want.
And then the long-term goal is actually not to be paying for specific content like that, but doing a revenue share model once the whole economy around video on Facebook is built up.
And I think Mark touched on the question of business model here, and our focus really is on revenue share.
Deborah Crawford - Facebook, Inc. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.
My hope is to help more than 1 billion people join meaningful groups to strengthen our social fabric over the next few years.
We're doing this by focusing on three key priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing innovative ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
We also recently announced that over 5 million businesses are actively advertising on Facebook, including more than 1 million in emerging markets.
Marketers can see previews of their ads across Facebook and Instagram before rolling them out and get tips to help drive business results.
Advertisers can now target Dynamic Ads to broad audiences and are seeing great results.
In a recent study Facebook commissioned with Kantar, 30% of mobile shoppers said video is the best way to discover new products.
Collection helps marketers tell stories on mobile by combining creative videos or photos of product images.
Advertisers can now reach over 200 million daily actives on Stories to do everything from building brands to selling products.
This daily number represented 66% of the 1.94 billion people that visited Facebook during the month of March, which was up 282 million or 17% compared to last year.
Our community growth in Q1 was driven by product improvement, internet.org, and ongoing third-party promotional data plans in markets like India.
Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Thanks for taking the question, one for Mark and then perhaps one for Sheryl or Dave.
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.
And we're working hard to help advertisers develop the video creative that really works for mobile because that really makes a really big difference.
To share one of my favorite new examples, Subway working with their agency 360i developed video ads and images for Facebook and Instagram to promote the limited time offer Reuben sandwich.
Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
This last quarter we extended viewability measurement to the Audience Network, added another verification partner, DoubleVerify, for video and display measurement, and introduced our MMM [Marketing Mix Modeling] portal so that we can help people measure across all of the different platforms and compare the effectiveness of their ad spend no matter what their end goal is.
Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura Instinet.
When you think about what really drives great performance for both people who are using Facebook but for marketers, it's well-targeted ads.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC.
Your next question comes from the line Ross Sandler from Barclays.

",61.09,0.56922066
facebook,q2,2017,"Over the next five years, we're going to build ecosystems around products that a lot of people are already using.
We're also working to build a business ecosystem around Messenger and WhatsApp. Messenger and WhatsApp both have large communities, and they're growing quickly, with 1 billion people now using WhatsApp daily.
And we think that this has the potential to be a powerful tool to bring people together and help build community in some new ways.
Given the size and engagement of our audiences, Facebook and Instagram are the best platforms to reach people and drive business results.
More video is being shared and watched on Facebook than ever before, and it's increasingly helping people and businesses connect.
We're working hard to help marketers adopt mobile-first video ad strategies for Facebook and Instagram.
We continue to see strong growth and engagement in our global community as well as momentum in our mobile ads business.
We're also pleased to see strong adoption and community growth across video, Instagram Stories, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Turning now to the financials, all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.
As we have discussed before, we continue to expect that Facebook ad load will play a less significant factor driving advertising revenue growth going forward, and that desktop ad revenue growth rates will slow in the second half of 2017 when we begin to lap efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers.
We also expect that our video content investments will contribute to operating expense growth in the second half of 2017.
We will continue to invest aggressively in the many opportunities we see ahead, as we make progress on our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
Mark, the offerings on the core Facebook app have improved and changed a lot over the years from Groups, Live Video Search, et cetera.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So the main value proposition for the Facebook app is helping people share any type of content that they want with any audience that matters to them.
If you're a business and you have a higher ROI for interacting with a person in your messaging thread than you do on the mobile web or trying to get them to install an app, then that creates this positive feedback loop, where you're going to point your ads towards the Messenger thread.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. So we're really happy that our growth has been really strong across our verticals, and that continues to be the case.
I think the heaviest lifting of the work we do is really helping marketers in different verticals focus on the right metrics, which are the sales metrics, because for too long our industry has been focused on proxy metrics, how long someone viewed a video, even brand lift, measurements we care about, but these are all proxy metrics.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So a lot of the themes around building community and bringing people closer together have been underscored by a lot of the experiences that I've had traveling around.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. And then, Dave, just hoping you can put a finer point on the timing around the reduction in ad load growth.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I mean, to the first question, we're going to build the services that we think are useful.
And so the work that we have cut out for us is to help marketers and working with their agencies evolve the format of the ads so that they're optimized for mobile, optimized for Facebook, optimized for Instagram.
So we're currently going through the process of figuring out what we want to invest in over the next year and doing our long-range planning, and this is certainly one of the areas where I think we want to be investing a lot more in and believe that there's a big opportunity and can accelerate all the effort.
I do think, as you say, this is one of the rare times in business where you can look at messaging platforms that exist and see how they've successfully monetized in other parts of the world and have that be a floor.
But in a lot of markets around the world, we see that ad quality is increasing at a very fast rate, and that makes it so that a lot of times people do ask for the content, which of course creates a very different dynamic.
But for all the reasons that I've said here around our own experience doing this in other contexts with Facebook and Instagram, proof points in the market of how it's worked, I think over the long term I'm pretty confident that we will get there, and it's our job to just go do that.
Should we consider investment in video content the number two driver of OpEx growth in the back half of the year?
On the Messenger ads, I think the way we think about it is, as Mark said, we have a lot of work to do to work on the format of that.
And so as we work on rolling out more Ad Breaks, and we are rolling out slowly, we're really focused on finding ways to help marketers measure the right things, and that's a very important focus for the company going forward.
And do you see this enabling of great organic interactions, as Mark put it, as a way to ultimately make Messenger a great ad platform, or do you think that enabling these other business services can lead to other monetization opportunities down the road, independent of advertising?
In terms of the bots, what we really think about is our businesses and people making useful connections on both sides on Messenger or any platform.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So, there have been a number of questions about Messenger.
But if there's one message here that I think is actually important to say, it's that we're trying to communicate that the pace of growing the Messenger business, it's a longer-term thing.
I actually think over the next couple of years or few years, the much bigger driver of the business and determinant of how we do is going to be video, not Messenger.
Messenger, I think, is a really important thing and WhatsApp over a three- to five-year period, and we're investing a lot in it.
And I think that those questions around video, which I'm optimistic about, but there are real questions there that we need to manage well, is going to be a much bigger driver of the business over the next two to three years likely even than the trajectory of what we're doing on Messenger and WhatsApp. Look, that's not just happening.
So I think that that's a thing that we take seriously, whether it's connectivity and making sure that people actually all around the world get to enjoy and benefit from the opportunities that the Internet has or the improvements that come from AI, or eventually upgrading the computing platforms that we all get to use.
Meaningful communities on Facebook are groups that quickly become an important part of your social network experience and your real world support structure.
Our goal is to help more than 1 billion people join meaningful communities.
Next, I want to give a quick update on what we're building over our three time horizons: making our existing services more useful now; building new ecosystems over the next five years around our products that a lot of people already use; and creating foundational technologies to achieve our mission over the next ten years.
We've achieved some major milestones, delivered good business results, and set clear goals around building strong communities and bringing people and the world closer together, but we have a long way to go.
Our goal is to build meaningful connections between people and businesses by focusing on our three key priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing innovative ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
Last quarter, I talked about how our Dynamic Ads help retailers and e-commerce companies promote their products across devices.
Dynamic Ads show people the products that are most relevant to them based on actions they've taken, such as viewing items on a company's website.
From driving brand awareness to increasing sales, businesses can now use full-screen Instagram Stories ads for any goal.
Marketers of all sizes are increasingly following our best practices, like optimizing their ads to drive real-world outcomes rather than focusing on proxy metrics such as page likes and video views.
For example, we introduced value optimization, which helps businesses show ads to people who are most likely to spend based on previous purchase behavior.
We also introduced value-based Lookalike Audiences, which use machine learning to help marketers reach people who are similar to their most valuable current customers.
We know that many marketers want to verify and compare results across platforms, and that's why we're focused on giving our clients more options for third-party measurement and verification.
As marketers build more meaningful connections with people on mobile, we help them grow their businesses, which in turn grows ours.
This number represents 66% of the 2.01 billion people that visited Facebook during the month of June, which was up 294 million or 17% compared to last year.
Our community growth was again driven by product improvements on Android, our Internet.org effort, and ongoing third-party promotional data plans in markets like India.
In addition, we expect that our strategic focus on driving engagement with mobile video may slow advertising impression growth, given the relatively fewer ad impressions in video relative to News Feed.
We are ramping our infrastructure investments to support global growth and anticipate more data center building activity in the second half of this year.
Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo.
Sheryl, you guys have rolled out some initiatives designed to address specific advertising categories like Dynamic Travel Ads. Could we anticipate more efforts going forward to address categories that may be relatively underpenetrated by Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network?
I think two years ago at F8, you talked about WhatsApp user base about really north of 1 billion sending out 50 billion messages a day, and Messenger was about 1 billion and 20 billion messages a day, so implying kind of like 2.5 times the engagement on WhatsApp compared to Messenger.
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Robert Baird.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen.
May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks for taking my questions.
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson.
Your next question comes from the line of Rob Sanderson from MKM Partners.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research.
I'm curious how you think that impacts both the consumer product as well as the advertising business.
",54.76,0.7410521
facebook,q3,2017,"Thank you, good afternoon and welcome to Facebook's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.
Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
And even without legislation, we're already moving forward on our own to bring advertising on Facebook to an even higher standard of transparency than ads on TV or other media.
This goes both for sharing, where we've seen Stories in Instagram and Status in WhatsApp grow very quickly, each with more than 300 million daily actives, and also for consuming video content.
Now we're starting to test business features that make it easier for people to make the same kinds of connections with businesses through WhatsApp. We're also seeing good progress with Workplace, helping companies connect their own teams internally through their own versions of Facebook.
We're continuing to build our business by focusing on our same three priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing new ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
They've grown so much from marketing on Facebook that they've been able to hire 10 new employees this year alone.
Now they sell their grooming products in 38 countries using mobile video ads on Facebook and Instagram.
People and businesses are finding creative new ways to use full-screen vertical video in Stories.
We're also seeing how immersive video and images can help people discover new products on Facebook.
In Q3, we introduced new tools powered by machine learning and automation to help businesses reach people more likely to spend with them.
Duplicate accounts are those that we believe are used by the same person and represent real activity and engagement on Facebook.
Year-to-date capital expenditures were approximately $4.5 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers, office facilities, and network infrastructure.
We continued to invest aggressively across the business, but there are three important factors driving an acceleration in our expense growth rates from 2017 levels.
And then secondly for Sheryl, you made such good progress growing the advertising business across SMB in a lot of verticals.
If you step back, could you talk to any areas or any verticals where you really see the potential for material improvements or verticals you're having a hard time cracking into that you think can really be bigger drivers of ad revenue growth going forward?
And I think that's really what's allowing us to improve yield and effectively driving higher effective CPMs for us while still delivering business outcomes to them at attractive ROIs. It's really about us getting better at targeting and working with especially people where we get those downstream signals like direct response advertisers.
Just going back maybe to the investment and security comments, maybe could you provide a little more detail just on what that investment could look like and how we could think about that showing up in R&D, cost of revs, G&A, or maybe a combination, and then maybe any early thoughts on GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] and potential impact there and maybe some of these transparency efforts if they could have possible benefit?
First, as you've integrated more video content into Facebook, are you seeing better time spent per user?
Whereas when you engage with public content, you might get informed or be entertained, but it's not necessarily increasing social capital in the same way or building relationships between people.
Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Certainly, this quarter we saw that ad load had a much less significant impact on impression growth.
Because I don't think someone like Spielberg is going to work for an ad revenue share, no matter how good that advertising is.
And then when you look at sports, which I also think about as being really relevant content that has a huge community around it, something like the NFL mobile rights I think come up next year.
And we've certainly found on the Internet and YouTube and in other places that there are whole industries around creators with different cost structures than traditional Hollywood folks who can produce very informative and engaging content that a lot of people like and enjoy and that builds communities and that helps people connect together in a way that definitely can be supported by this ad model.
Wehner - Facebook, Inc. And then even after we establish a flywheel here and get content being produced for ad revenue share, that's going have a different margin structure than core News Feed.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. Visa with SocialCode and BBDO created 10-second videos with text overlays showing people making digital payments.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets.
We already have about 10,000 people working on safety and security, and we're planning to double that to 20,000 in the next year to better enforce our community standards and review ads.
And the reason I'm talking about this on our earnings call is that I've directed our teams to invest so much in security on top of the other investments we're making that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward, and I wanted our investors to hear that directly from me.
But as video grows, it's important to remember that Facebook is about bringing people closer together and enabling meaningful social interaction.
So we're going to focus our products on all the ways to build community around the videos that people share and watch.
I want to close by talking about what we're doing to protect our platform and help ensure that the ads and content people see on Facebook and Instagram are legitimate and authentic.
We saw continued growth in engagement in our community as well as strong performance in our ads business.
Maybe revisiting Mark's comments at the beginning of the call, I would love to get a better sense or granularity about what sort of video content you'd like to see on the platform that could drive a more active or interactive experience than passive.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So the strategy here around helping people connect reflects more on what we do around the videos than some of the content itself.
So we're going to continue investing heavily in video content for Watch that is centered around people, that is centered around the things that people want to talk and connect around, that give people a sense of pride and bring people together.
Just, Mark, to go back on your focus on community and video, I was wondering if you could share with us or help us understand what you're seeing in engagement trends or maybe time spent per user on the core Facebook platform, as you've had so many efforts focused on community and video.
I think if you think about where the growth remains, it really is in increasing the relevance of the ads, because the ads I think are getting better in terms of reaching the right people at the right time.
And if you look at the percentage of our ads business where people are using our most sophisticated approaches to finding the right audience, I think we still have a lot of opportunity for growth there, and that will improve both the quality of the ads people see but also the returns to marketers.
And those three factors are the ones that I outlined in my commentary: number one, the substantial investment that Mark highlighted that we're making to just improve the security on our platform; two, the video content investments we're making for Watch tab; and then three, additional investments we're making in the long term initiatives like AR/VR, AI, and connectivity.
But most people who come to News Feed and who come to Facebook today in general are trying figure out Ã¢ÂÂ they're trying to see what's going on with their friends, see what's happening in the world.
Now in order to build that up, we think it makes sense to first invest in a bunch of lighthouse content, some that we may produce or some that we may license, to get to your question.
We just want to start the flywheel going, so that way there's content and communities that are there that support this use case of people coming to Facebook specifically to engage in that.
But first, we need to build this behavior where people want to come intentionally to engage with this content.
So I think you're going to see it impacting across the spectrum of our lines, but overall one of the significant factors driving the acceleration in growth rate.
And we're going to focus a lot more on helping people share videos of their moments in their lives.
And what the research that we found shows is that when you're actually engaging with people and having meaningful connections, that's time well spent, and that's the thing that we want to focus on.
Justin, then your question on ARPU in the U.S., we do think that there are opportunities to continue to grow the business in the U.S. on a lot of different fronts.
And we're going to invest both in people and technology because we think that both are really important parts of the solution here, to go after all different parts of these problems.
Well, I think the answer to that is we don't know all the answers around what kinds of content are going to work and are not, so we will probably experiment with a number of different things.
And what we would like to transition that more to over time and what an increasing amount of the content is, is revenue shares for ads shown in the videos.
I think Ã¢ÂÂ look, today we're talking about the additional investments we're making in terms of the lighthouse content on the Watch tab, so we are putting a substantial investment behind that.
The ability to show something in News Feed and then show a video in Watch and then show something on Instagram and measure results across the full funnel we think are very worthy investments for the long-term health of the business.
So earlier in the year, when we were working on problems like seeing issues when people were going live, there was this really serious issue around people with self-harm and in some cases suicide on Live, and we made an investment in AI tools and in dramatically increasing the staffing of the team that was working on that and brought the amount of time to review those Live videos down through a combination of those things to Ã¢ÂÂ I think it's under 10 minutes now.
So that way, through a combination of the AI tooling that we build and having people to look at these things, we can get it right faster for more of the types of content.
",49.69,0.69708616
facebook,q4,2017,"We've also gotten feedback from our community that these moments that lead us to connect to the unique experience that people want and expect from Facebook.
But in the last couple of years, the ecosystem of public content like video, news, and post from businesses has grown massive to the point where it's starting to crowd out the personal connection that people value most.
So let me be clear, helping people connect is more important than maximizing the time they spend on Facebook.
Now as I made clear announcing these changes, I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down as a result.
For example, changes we made to improve quality in the fourth quarter contributed to a decline in people using Facebook daily in some country.
By focusing on meaningful interactions, I expect the time we all spend on Facebook will be more valuable and I always believe that if we do the right and deliver deeper value, our community in our business will be stronger over the long-term.
But just like the changes we're making that will impact time spent these investments will help us build a stronger community over the long-term.
The growth of Stories will have an impact on how we build products and think about our business, including Whatsapp and Instagram which are the number one and number two most used Stories product in the world.
Beyond the video, we have a long roadmap working to help people connect in meaningful ways.
A new app designed specifically for small and medium businesses to connect with people they want to reach.
We continue to make progress on our three priorities; helping businesses, leverage the power of mobile, developing new ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.
Facebook and Instagram allow people and businesses connect and our especially meaningful platforms for small businesses.
This year, we will visit more than 30 cities in the U.S. and Europe to work side by side with SMBs, start-ups and NGOs. As people and businesses shift to mobile, Instagram continues to grow quickly.
About two-thirds of the visits to Instagram business profiles are from people who don't follow them and this is helping bring in new customers.
For example, we're continuing to invest in value optimization, which helps advertisers show their ads to people who are likely to spend more with them.
As Mark said, 2017 was a challenging and important year for Facebook, a year where we committed to increasing our investment in the safety and security of our community, it was also a strong year for our business where our investments in helping our clients grow payoff.
The biggest focus Ã¢ÂÂ the biggest impact of the focus on meaningful interactions as Mark mentioned will be in areas like passive video, where from a business perspective, we monetize less on a time spent basis.
So if you think about it in terms of things like post views in News Feed, which drives impression growth that we think this will have less of an impact, and so that's sort of built in to what I had said about the business commentary when I commented on 2018 revenue outlook.
When I think about the MSI changes, obviously any change that's beneficial for our community is good for the long run health of our business, because as Mark said, we care not just about time spent on Facebook, but time well spent.
When you think about GDPR, the Facebook family of apps already applies the core principles in GDPR frame, which are transparency and control and we are building on this to make weÃ¢ÂÂre ready to fully comply by May. We're going to continue to give people are personalized experience to be clear about how are using the data and give choices and we realize that this means that some users might opt out of our ads targeting tool.
We also have Ã¢ÂÂ we think the best stability to target and make advertising relevant for businesses and people who see ads.
We're continuing to build the products that allow businesses to get a higher return for the dollars they spend and allow people to see more relevant information in ads on our platform.
What will you be watching for in terms of either the time spent on the platform or the user growth on the platform or relative engagement to say that you've got the mix right and that people are seeing the right of content and have a healthy experience with Facebook over the next couple of years?
So that will first take hold as the series of News Feed changes, but over time there are going to be new products that we build new interfaces that the team is designed with the goal of encouraging interactions between people.
So the thing that we're going to be measuring is basically the number of interactions that people have on the platform and off because of what they're seeing that they report to us is as meaningful.
But we continue to make changes to improve and to optimize around driving meaningful social interactions as Mark talked about.
So we have multiple clients who will show an ad, a video ad to everyone in the U.S. for example or to a big cohort of people and then they'll follow up with an ad that target on either Instagram or Facebook to people who engage with that first that then they can follow up with the next team and we are seeing as businesses are increasingly measuring your ad spend in terms of their real ROI for sales that even within our own platforms.
So you can think of all of this work and Sheryl talked about the value optimization efforts as part of that as being an effort to improve the yield of the impressions that we have to drive downstream business results for advertising partners.
So we're still very optimistic long-term that Watch will be used for video that helps to bring people closer together and that will correlate with all the things that our community is telling us they want and that correlate with the measures of wellbeing that we think that social products can generate by helping people build relationships in terms of all the long-term measures of wellbeing that we care about like long-term happiness and health et cetera.
What we're excited about is that our business is helping people connect with things they want to buy.
And Sheryl talked about value optimization and that sort of work that we're doing, and so I think we've got continued opportunities with e-commerce going forward.
The first and most tactical or just the optimization to everything that you see, right, from ranking in News Feeds, your ranking of ads or search, or improving our security systems, and that's driving a lot of the business and the quality improvement that we're seeing and that's really important.
In the last few months, there have already been more than 100 instances where we've been able to reach out and get in touch with first responders that they can give you people the help that they need, and that's a big structural change in the way that we do business in terms of protecting the security and integrity of our community.
And I do think that that is likely going to continue this trend of decreasing passive consumption, but if we do our jobs well, it should increase the number of meaningful interactions that people have.
I mean we think it'll be good for the business over the long-term, but this is what people are telling us is what they want on the product.
And we think that we can help drive that and improve people's lives by doing that, so we're absolutely going to go do that.
Joining me today to discuss our results are: Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
Giving people a voice who didn't have one before, strengthening relationships by helping family and friends stay connected wherever they are, and enabling more than 70 million small businesses to grow and create jobs.
We've also built new technology to detect suicidal posts that have helped first responders reach more than 100 people who needed help quickly and we've built AI systems to flag suspicious behavior around elections in real time and remove terroristsÃ¢ÂÂ content.
More than 700 million people each month now come to Facebook to buy and sell things.
We launched a plugin for Messengers that people can chat live with companies on their websites, and now more than 2 billion messages are sent between businesses and customers every month.
Our second priority is developing innovative ad products, each year mobile advertising reaches new milestones during the holiday shopping season.
For example, Holiday Inn Express recently used dynamic ads for travel with our collection formats to advertise to people who search for hotels on their website, but hadn't yet booked.
As we expand and improve our ad products advertisers are increasingly developing mobile first ads rather than simply taking their TV creative and putting them online.
We're seeing the short form videos work well and Instagram Stories were people can watch a full-screen vertical video and swipe up to quickly learn about a product or brand.
Facebook give small businesses the same powerful tools that were previously only available to large advertisers.
In addition to rolling out the ad transparency tool in Canada that Mark mentioned, we've disabled the option that less advertisers exclude people and specific multicultural affinity segments until we can develop better safeguards against discrimination.
As Mark mentioned certain product quality changes impacted our DAU growth.

facebook,q1,2018,"But it's clear now we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well, whether that's foreign interference in elections, fake news, hate speech, or app developers and data privacy.
We are doubling our team working on security and content review to more than 20,000 people by the end of this year, and this includes content reviewers with specific language skills to detect hate speech in places like Myanmar.
We've seen people come together after Hurricane Harvey to raise more than $20 million for relief, and we've seen more than 80 million small businesses use Facebook to grow and create jobs.
Last quarter, we shared our well-being research into the good and bad uses of technology that showed that when you use the internet to interact and build relationships that's correlated with greater long-term well-being and greater health and happiness over time.
We continue to work on connectivity and our Internet.org efforts have now helped almost 100 million people get access to the Internet who may not have had it otherwise.
And finally, we have some big moments for virtual reality coming up, and I'm excited to get Oculus Go in people's hands soon.
We surveyed small businesses in 18 countries, and more than half of SMBs on Facebook say they've been able to hire more people due to growth in demand since joining our platform.
After Hurricane Harvey damaged her business last year, she used Facebook to find new customers.
Advertising supported businesses like Facebook equalize access and improve opportunity.
In the coming months, GDPR will give us another opportunity to make sure people fully understand how their information is used by our services.
We continue to make progress on our three priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing new ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
So on virtual reality here, I think the big picture is that every 10 to 15 years or so there is a major new computing paradigm, right, whether that's DOS and then Windows and kind of desktop UI and then web browsers and now mobile phones and apps.
One of my great regrets in how we've run the company so far is I feel like we didn't get to shape the way that mobile platforms developed as much as would be good because they were developed contemporaneously with Facebook early on, right.
Like, is there other lines of business, other revenue streams that people should be thinking about that create substantial opportunities, and specifically subscription, and then maybe if you could just touch on from a commerce standpoint now that Instagram's starting to be such a big driver of commerce, how do you think about diversifying revenues versus essentially being almost pure advertising?
At the same time, we also have a responsibility to keep moving forward and keep building tools that bring people together in meaningful new ways.
That's why beyond the investments we're making to secure our platform, we're going to invest even more in building the experiences that bring people together on Facebook in the first place.
One of the interesting opportunities and challenges over the coming years will be making sure that ads are as good in Stories as they are in feeds.
Our commitment to you is that we will continue to improve our ads model by strengthening privacy and choice, while giving businesses of all sizes new and better tools to help them grow.
Turning to our outlook, the changes that Mark and Sheryl described will, we believe, benefit our community and our business and will serve to strengthen Facebook overall.
At the highest level, we believe that we can continue to build the great ads business while protecting people's privacy.
We have a lot of work ahead and are investing aggressively to enhance safety, security and privacy, while also focusing on our mission of giving people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
Mark, so you focused on bringing people together and clearly have this massive platform with strong engagement, but can you talk about some of the business opportunities for Facebook on the platform away from advertising, and where you're most focused there?
So even when we do other things, like we're running tests of payments, we have Marketplace which is growing and doing well, there may be other ways that we could think about making money from those, but in general our strategy is to offer those services at cost and make it so that businesses can bid what it is worth to them to run ads in the system.
We think that that is both the most efficient way to run the business, it offers every business in the world the lowest prices that we can potentially offer, and it provides a great free service to people around the world.
I know that a lot of people have had questions about the business model, and this is something that I just think we at Facebook are very proud of.
And we think that it is the right way to build a service that connects everyone around the world.
And then maybe more for Mark, there have been some recent reports that imply that even some seemingly simple things that Facebook may not be proactively identifying or addressing have come up and I guess the question is, is it that it's not as simple as it may seem, or is it that these reports aren't accurate, this just has to do with some of the sensitive data like social security information being showing up online?
So on GDPR, I think fundamentally we believe we can continue to build a great ads business while protecting the privacy of the people who use Facebook.
Mark, in the changes you talked about at the product level at the beginning part of the year, as you've started to make those changes and some of the content people see on the platform has evolved, what does that mean for engagement?
Wanted to know if you'd give us any color about your own conversations on the business side, on the messaging apps, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and how investors should think about the opportunity there.
And that follows a lot of feedback directly from our community that people want Facebook to be more about friends and family and less about just content consumption.
And it also follows the well-being research that we've done that suggests that when people use the Internet for interacting with people and building relationships, that is correlated with all of the positive measures of well-being that you just expect like longer term health and happiness, feeling more connected and less lonely, whereas just passively consuming content is not necessarily positive on those dimensions.
I think that that's the thing that people can uniquely do on Facebook that they can't do on other services that may be more about just consuming content.
So we think that this is going in the direction of building a stronger community and a stronger business over the long term, and we're optimistic about what we're seeing here.
I guess, a second question is, do you think time spent on Facebook can start to grow again?
So we're continuing to invest in that work, and we think it's the right thing for the Facebook community in the long run.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So for Watch, the big thing that we're trying to do is help create new ways that people can connect, right?
And we think that that's the kind of experience that we can uniquely build and that that's going to further our mission and just be a unique thing that we can add to the world.
I'd say it's still pretty early overall in terms of the growth of this, but it's clearly an area that's important where I think we have something unique that we're going to bring to make this successful.
And on the testimony, these are important issues and I think that that was an important moment to be able to go and hear what people were wondering about and just to have a public hearing of answering all of the questions around Cambridge Analytica and what we knew and all the steps that we're taking on data privacy and developers to make sure that this doesn't happen again and to lay out all the different things that we're doing.
Advertisers ask the same questions as people are, that they want to make sure their and their customers' data is protected, and I think we are able to answer those questions in a compelling way.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. When you think about the way people have the choice to restrict data use, I think it would affect the product.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So I think that this is going to be a really big opportunity.
So I think what you're going to start to see are people interacting with pages, maybe follow a page on Facebook or Instagram.
David, could you just try to spell out a little bit more how GDPR could actually impact advertising revenue growth in the future, like, what's the doomsday scenario here?
And I think overall benefits not only the advertisers, but also the people who use Facebook.
When you think about the opportunities for the business broadly, you obviously are crushing it from an advertising standpoint when you look at any measure of growth.
So even if we just convert people who are advertising on Facebook into Instagram, that's a lot of a growth opportunity.
What's I think interesting and strong about our potential business growth is that we're able to do this across these services.
And if your goal is to connect to everyone and make sure that people can all participate, that ads-based model makes a lot of sense and we're going to continue to invest very heavily there.

facebook,q2,2018,"For the first time today, we're also releasing how many people use at least one of our apps, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger, and that's 2.5 billion people each month.
I want to start by talking about all the investments we've made over the last six months to improve safety, security and privacy across our services.
And at the same time, it was encouraging to see the vast majority of people affirm that they want us to use context, including from websites they visit, to make their ads more relevant and improve their overall product experience.
Now, in light of increased investment in security, we could choose to decrease our investment in new product areas, but we're not going to, because that wouldn't be the right way to serve our community and because we run this company for the long term not for the next quarter.
Now, perhaps one of the most important things we've done this year to bring people closer together is to shift News Feed to encourage connection with friends and family over passive consumption of content.
Now, there are more than 200 million people that are members of meaningful groups on Facebook, and these are communities that, upon joining, they become the most important part of your Facebook experience and a big part of your real world social infrastructure.
And we're seeing some real traction with some of the original program, from the talk show Red Table Talk, featuring Jada Pinkett Smith, to Skam, an interactive series that started in Norway and features a new style of storytelling where the characters have accounts on Facebook and Instagram, and key parts of the story are told not just through video, but through posts on their pages.
Stories continue to be a big part of the future of sharing too, and they're growing quickly across WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.
While we started off just implementing the basic Stories format, we've now moved well beyond it, and have built lots of new features like polls, questions, and collaborative stories and groups and events.
We've made the most progress here on Instagram, but this quarter, we started testing Stories ads on Facebook too.
More broadly, our strategy is to use Facebook's computing infrastructure, business platforms and security systems to serve people across all of our apps.
As we make these investments in transparency and accountability, we remain focused on our key priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile, developing innovative ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.
We see this trend toward video across all of our apps, from people sharing more video with their friends on Facebook, to watching more video from creators on Instagram, to having more video calls on WhatsApp and Messenger.
Ads in Stories are an immersive engaging way for people to interact with businesses.
This is our best estimate of our de-duplicated audience across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We believe this number better reflects the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of these services.
We plan to grow and promote certain engaging experiences like Stories that currently have lower levels of monetization, and we are also giving people who use our services more choices around data privacy, which may have an impact on our revenue growth.
In addition to increases in core product development and infrastructure, this growth is driven by increasing investment in areas like safety and security, AR/VR, marketing, and content acquisition.
Two. Just the first one on monetization of Facebook core versus Instagram; can you talk a little bit about how you think about monetization levels and the key drivers currently and, going forward, when we think about ad load, pricing and the importance of ad improvements across the two platforms over the next, call it, year or so?
And the second one on Instagram TV, maybe just talk about how you look at Ã¢ÂÂ think about the core consumer offering, how it varies from Facebook Watch and, philosophically, how you think about investing in premium content or sports content across these two products.
In terms of Facebook versus Instagram, they're obviously both contributing to revenue growth.
On the demand side, we see a good traction across both platforms, and we're rolling out more ability for advertisers to leverage ads in Stories with more formats and the like.
With Watch, a lot of what we're trying to do is make it so the video content that's on Facebook and some of the content that we're acquiring through original programming that people can come together with their friends to watch that content through things like Watch Party and engage and build community that way.
Maybe going back to the OpEx and your comments, Dave, looking out sort of medium to longer term, just wanted to understand if we can get a little bit more color on some of the drivers of that.
How much of it could be video in support of where you want to take the business over the medium and long term versus things that maybe don't necessarily have a revenue component to them like the security and the protection of the ecosystem that the whole team has been talking about since the end of last year?
We think that's the right thing to do for the business in terms of ensuring the community's safety and security and the durability of the franchise.
In addition, on the CapEx side, we're continuing to invest heavily on capital expenditures, first, to just get ahead of user growth and engagement and then also to make sure that we've got the compute available to support the growth of a number of the key drivers of our business around feed ranking and ads ranking.
Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. Dave, I think you said that the quarter-on-quarter growth rates are going to be high-single digits lower than the prior-year quarter-on-quarter growth rates versus 3Q and 4Q.
Secondly, we're going to be focusing on growing engaging new experiences like Stories and promoting those.
And then, finally, we're giving people who use the services more choice around privacy, and that's coming both in terms of impacts that could be ongoing from things like GDPR as well as other product options that we're providing that could have an impact on revenue growth.
One is that we just started getting a lot of feedback from people in the community that they wanted Facebook to be more about connecting with people, which is really the core of what it's always been, less so about viral videos or news content and just passive consumption.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. So, obviously, we started with ads in Facebook, and that was something we have grown and they continue to grow.
But I think we've launched some things that people are excited about and interested in like click-to-Messenger ads.
In terms of, I guess, going to the GDPR question, we've talked about Ã¢ÂÂ oh, sorry.
But then, Dave, I think you mentioned that because you're giving people more control over their privacy and data that this is one of the reasons why you're expecting the meaningful decel in the second half; so just trying to recognize those two things.
We do think that there will be some modest impact, and I don't want to overplay these factors, but you've got a couple of things going on.
And then in addition, we're continuing to focus our product development around putting privacy first and that's going to, we believe, have some impact on revenue growth.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. So, on Stories, we've seen great progress with Stories as a format for people to share on our platforms.
I think one of the other things we feel good about over the long run, not really the short run, is that since we have so many different places where you have Stories formats in Instagram and WhatsApp and Facebook, as volume increases of the opportunity, advertisers get more interested.
So I think when you look at the factors going forward, I would say we've got the currency impact, we've got some of the impacts around privacy and the like, but we continue to get good advertiser feedback on ROI.
Obviously, on the safety and security side, those are costs that are layering in that we think are the right thing to do for the business but don't necessarily have a revenue impact.
It also takes into account the ongoing investments we're making in the longer-term innovation work, which I don't think will necessarily have any meaningful revenue relative to the size of the business in those time frames.
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
We recently launched two important ad transparency tools: one to let anyone see the ads any page is running even if the ads aren't targeted to you; and the other an archive of ads with political or issue content that's starting in the U.S. ready for the midterm election.
But I'm confident that we will get this right given our results during last year's French and German elections, the Alabama special election, as well as this month's presidential election in Mexico, where our systems found and removed thousands of fake account pages and groups that violated our policies.
Our teams are focused on building new experiences that help people connect and start conversation.
We've taken strong steps to address a number of issues, including election integrity, fake news and protecting people's information.
The vast majority of ads on Facebook are run by legitimate organizations from small businesses looking for new customers to advocacy groups raising money for their causes.
We're seeing healthy growth in video ads among all advertiser segments.
M&M's UK recently used mobile-optimized five-second video ads on Facebook and Instagram to introduce M&M's Mix, a bag of three kinds of M&M's in one.
Their campaign worked, driving results not just for their new product but for the brand overall.
We know that creating video can be more difficult for small businesses that have fewer resources, so we've launched new tools on Facebook to help anyone make videos that work well on mobile.
When online retailer Overstock wanted to gain new customers and increase furniture sales, they ran video ads in Instagram Stories with a shop now button.
For example, automatic placements help advertisers get better results by showing ads across our platform wherever they'll perform best and at the lowest cost.
SumUp, a German payment start-up that helps small businesses accept debit and credit cards, switched from manual to automatic placements and increased sales by 34% in one week.
Advertisers of all sizes want to know if their ads are working and how to make them better, but smaller businesses don't always have this capability.
Their work over the past several months has helped millions of businesses grow and created new levels of transparency in advertising.
I'd note that European ad revenue growth decelerated more quickly than other regions and was impacted primarily by reduced currency tailwinds and, to a lesser extent, the roll out of GDPR.
We expect full-year 2018 capital expenditures will be approximately $15 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities.

facebook,q3,2018,"So just like most major social apps have feeds, including Pinterest, Twitter, or LinkedIn, but you wouldn't say that those services do the same things, I think many services will have Stories in the future too, but will serve different functions.
It's now growing quickly and I think we'll be in a better position soon, but our effort to shift Facebook from News Feed first to Stories first hasn't been as smooth as I had hoped.
Now, talking about messaging and Stories raises the question of what's the future of our feed product and the Facebook app overall.
From a business perspective, feeds will drive the majority of our growth over the next couple of years, at least until Stories become an even bigger driver.
While there's a lot to do to improve News Feed, our roadmap for the Facebook app is very focused on a few priorities: Stories, which we've discussed; video, which I'll get to in a moment; and a much bigger focus on communities and groups.
When we say communities, we mean both helping people connect with people who share their interests, which is a major need in people's lives, and also building out specific services for bringing people closer together, like helping you find someone to date, or find a job, or buy and sell things, or grow your small business, or create an event, or start fundraisers, or bring together a group to volunteer.
And while people may not spend as much time on some of these tools as they do in News Feed, these are very high-value activities for our community.
Video has grown a lot on our services, but as I mentioned earlier, we hit a dynamic where when it grows in feeds in Facebook and Instagram, it displaces some social interactions, and people tell us it makes the experience less valuable even though they're spending more time on it.
As we look ahead to 2019 and beyond, we're focused on continuing to build our clients' businesses and ours by helping advertisers reach consumers where they are and making ads better.
Today, the primary way advertisers are reaching people on our services is through Facebook News Feed and Instagram Feed.
Feed ads on Facebook and Instagram represent the majority of our revenue growth and the majority of opportunities for marketers to generate ROI.
At the same time, as Mark mentioned, more and more consumers are using stories and private messaging in addition to the time they spend in News Feed and Instagram Feed.
Last year, we started allowing advertisers to extend their News Feed ads to Marketplace, helping businesses reach people where they already shop.
We also continue to invest heavily in technology and people to remove bad content as quickly as possible and prevent it from going up in the first place, while giving advertisers more control over where their ads are placed.
For example, ads in Instagram Stories contributed to our impression growth this quarter, although these ads currently monetize at lower rates compared to feed ads.
And as I said in my opening remarks, I think we're going to be a lot better positioned here in Facebook in the next year.
When you think about some of the friction points you're trying to solve for on either the creative side or the selling-through side with respect to video and Stories, maybe you could call out some of the conversations you're having with advertisers and how you see some of the moves Facebook can make to solve for those friction points looking out to 2019 and beyond.
We have a very large and growing advertiser base, and that gives us we think a really strong position to get people into new formats.
So the right ad in News Feed is different than the right ad in an Instagram or a Facebook story is different than the right ad in Watch, which would be video-only.
Because we are looking to show relevant ads to the right person at the right time, the systems we have that understand in a privacy-protected way what ads people are likely to be more interested in, those work, whether you're in Stories or Watch or Instagram Feed or News Feed.
In terms of what we're seeing as opportunities, I mean, we continue to see good growth opportunities for revenue across both Facebook and Instagram, including both feed and Stories.
I think in terms of impression growth, you're going to have more opportunities in Stories, probably more opportunity on Instagram, but good revenue growth opportunities in both places.
So we needed to figure out a way so that video can grow, but people can also keep on interacting doing what they tell us that they uniquely want from Facebook.
The basic story that we've seen within the Facebook app is, over the last few years, the amount of time that people were spending in the app was increasing primarily because people were consuming more public content, like passive video consumption and news.
And we think that there's a lot more connecting in community that people want there.
On Facebook overall, I feel like we have a handle on what the drivers of this are and we're kind of driving it to be what people tell us they want and what we think is going to be sustainable over time.
We continue to see good growth opportunities across the platform on both Facebook and Instagram and feed and Stories.
I would characterize the launch of Status apps on WhatsApp as being a much smaller thing than a driver of 2019 revenue growth, and it's going to be more about Instagram and Facebook.
We think there's a lot of opportunity for people to have commercial intent, if not have it when they start, but develop it because they see things they're interested in, in both.
First, just, Mark, your comments in prepared remarks on Stories having potential to be a bigger medium than News Feed suggests that the engagement is a net positive in terms of time spent or sessions per user.
And I think we'll get there over time, where the performance for Stories ads will converge with what we have seen in feed.
But I can't tell you just yet what that timeframe is going to look like, but I think we're well-positioned over the long-term because we're leading in Stories in basically every country.
So I think we're still seeing good growth in Europe on the revenue front, and a lot of the similar dynamics playing out in Europe as in the rest of the world where you see good impression growth opportunity, especially in areas like Instagram and Stories contributing to overall ability to drive revenue growth.
When you think about the transition or people using feed versus Stories, there are a couple of things that are different.
I think when you think about the long-term monetization opportunities, it's really going to depend upon the time people spend.
But I think in terms of it converging on feed from any pricing perspective, that's a journey that's going to take years, not quarters.
I think we've made some strong changes on Facebook in terms of meaningful social interactions, and I think the history of our ability to develop and iterate on consumer products shows that we can help people as they evolve, share the things they want to share, and have a very meaningful and important experience in feed as they're sharing.
As there are more Stories and feed, as more people are engaged in Facebook and increasingly in Instagram, that gives us more opportunities just on the supply side of ads.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements.
Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
Public sharing will always be very important, but people increasingly want to share privately too, and that includes both just smaller audiences with messaging and ephemerally with stories.
People now send around 100 billion messages each day using our services that even our second most popular service, Messenger, has a higher daily message volume than SMS had globally at its peak.
People now share more than 1 billion stories every day.
For a few years, we saw a trend where people's time was increasing primarily because they were consuming more video and public content, even as they interacted with friends and family less.
That means the trends in how people are interacting have improved, even though we've purposefully reduced time spent on things like lower-quality viral videos and news to achieve this.
We know that our continued growth depends upon maintaining the trust of the people who use our services and earning our clients' business each and every day in a very competitive environment.
Quarter after quarter, we make improvements that help advertisers use feed ads to launch new products, find new customers, build awareness and increase sales, all in a highly efficient way.
On Messenger, over 10 billion messages are sent between people and businesses every month.
We have a big opportunity to help our large and growing advertiser base expand to new platforms and formats to reach potential customers.
Protecting people's privacy is incredibly important because people and businesses will only use our services if they feel Facebook can be trusted and if sharing on our platform is safe.
Improvements like this one add up and help businesses maximize the value they're gaining from our products over time.
I'd also like to share our initial outlook on 2019 operating expenses and CapEx. We also expect that full-year 2019 capital expenditures will be approximately $18 billion to $20 billion, driven by a continuation of our data center build strategy that seeks to put in place adequate capacity ahead of our needs.

They ran a video ad campaign across Facebook and Instagram Stories and they targeted people with dog-related interests and used Custom Audiences to exclude people who had already purchased their product.
Feed is fundamentally about information being pushed to a consumer and us helping figure out what is most interesting and most engaging and I think, in many ways, positive for people.

facebook,q4,2018,"For the past couple of years, most of our focus and energy has gone into addressing some of the biggest social issues around the future of the Internet, including election integrity, content governance, safety and security, data privacy and digital well-being.
We've made significant progress and we're going to continue this work, but we're also going to allocate more of our energy to building new and inspiring ways to help people connect and build community.
Our second priority for 2019 is that as we make progress on these social issues, we also need to deliver new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives.
We're going to get to a point soon where people feel like Facebook is about as communities as it - is about communities as much as it's about your friends and family where almost everyone is in a group that's meaningful to them and that community is a central part of their experience.
Now, we're still going to make mistakes along the way, but we now have a clearer sense of the path ahead and we're ready to work with people to understand our role and move towards good outcomes, whether that's regulation on content or data, cooperation on shared threats, working openly to make sure AI best serves people, or just standing up for the kind of open and connected world that we all want to see.
We offer a service free to everyone to help you stay connected with the people you care about, express what you're thinking and feeling, get help when you need it most, support the causes and ideas you believe in, start and grow businesses no matter where you are, and that makes a lot of good possible and we're committed to building technology that people can use to create positive change.
We have focused on making progress in these important areas while continuing to grow our community and our business.
Beyond Stories and messaging, we have an opportunity to connect people and businesses on new services like Marketplace.
Looking ahead, we see more opportunities to use AI to keep people safe on Facebook and help businesses grow.
This is our best estimate of our de-duplicated audience across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. We believe these numbers better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our services.
In conclusion, we are confident in our ability to continue to invest effectively in the key priorities that Mark outlined in his opening remarks: making progress on the major social issues facing the Internet, building new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives, and growing our business by supporting the many businesses that rely on our services.
People are already doing a lot of commerce activity and are really interested in following brands, and I think making sure that, that works is - and does well is a big deal.
And just as we did that in mobile, now we're very focused on doing that in the new things that people are doing, and Stories is a big part of that, Messaging will be further out, but as important as well.
And so we think the mix shift to Stories is a big opportunity for us and it's going to take time to continue to get advertisers in, but we're very happy with demand to date.
And from a pricing perspective, there's - we've got to improve our ability to grow the number of advertisers using Stories and improve price there, but it's going to be more reliant on that in terms of revenue growth.
People really like this in WhatsApp. I think it's the direction that we should be going in with more things in the future.
So I can give you a few more examples like that, but I guess the way that I'm thinking about this is that there's a handful of cases that people are telling us that they want to be able to integrate and communicate more easily across the networks.
One, Mark, on Facebook Watch, what do you think are some of the things you're still trying to solve for on either the content side or the consumer engagement side to drive broader adoption of Watch and turning it into sort of the mechanism for customers that you're trying to solve for over the medium to long term?
And the big thing that unlocked a lot of growth in Watch is we basically were able to move a bunch of the video-watching behavior to a different tab, where people intentionally go to the tab because they want to watch a video and browse and see what's going on.
The two big things that we're really focused on now in Watch are, within the Watch tab, also just making sure that the consumption isn't all just passive consumption and making it so that there are more two-way interactions between viewers and the creators and that we can help build community around that, where we've built this great feature, Watch Party, that allows people to come together with their friends to watch different content and premiers.
So these are all things that make it so the video-watching experience isn't just about passive consumption but about interaction, and that's going to, I think, help really drive engagement as well.
Then there's also the monetization side for creators, which is going to be really important for making it so that we have the content that people want to consume.
This is a long-term direction that we're going to continue making more ranking changes and building more products around, but I think that this is kind of reflected broadly in the numbers that you see on engagement and the growth in daily actives and how people are engaging across the family of apps.
If you look at what percentage of our ads are truly relevant to the people who are seeing them, I think we've done a lot better over the last couple of years, but we have a long way to go.
And then when we have new opportunities that open up like Stories, even with some pressure on pricing, we think that gives us more inventory and more opportunity and more formats, and we haven't really even gotten started on future things like messaging.
So when you think about the types of products that we're building on messaging, where encryption is going to play a huge role, sharing with your friends, where Stories, which is ephemeral, is the main thing that's growing.
And I'll add one thing, which I think David has said this a couple of times, but I think it's worth emphasizing that while I'm excited about the road map that we have and it's going to be great over the long term, the growth of the business over the next year, a few quarters or the near term is going to be mostly based on the growth of Stories and the core News Feed work.
So for Groups, the main thing that we're focused on is making it so that connecting with communities of people that you're interested in is going to be as central to the experience as connecting with friends and family.
And friends and family is always going to be really central to what we do, but we just think that there's an opportunity now to do more and to make it so that people can also be a part of these meaningful communities.
It's also the first priority again for this year, is making - continuing to make progress on the big, substantive issues facing the Internet and our company because there's still a lot more to do here, and this is incredibly important.
At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Facebook Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call.
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
There are now 2.7 billion people using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger each month and more than 2 billion people who use at least one of our services every day.
Going into 2019, we're focused on four priorities: first, continue making progress on the major social issues facing the Internet and our company; second, build new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future; third, keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses, mostly small businesses, that rely on our services to grow and create jobs; then fourth, communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in the world.
Now, I'm not talking about the many day-to-day iterative improvements we make so that ranking gets a bit better or that things get a little faster, but I'm talking about major improvements to people's lives that whole communities recognize and say, ""Wow, we're all doing something new on Facebook or on WhatsApp that we weren't doing before."" For example, Instagram just passed 500 million daily actives on Stories.
This means we're finding ways for video to grow outside of News Feed so it doesn't displace the social interactions that people primarily come to our services for.
And I feel like we've come out of 2018 not only making real progress on important issues but having a clear sense of what we believe are the right ways to move forward.
The result is that people see more relevant ads and small businesses can reach people in ways that only big companies previously could.
Framebridge, a start-up that provides custom picture framing, recently used automatic placements to run ads across Instagram Stories, Facebook and Instagram feed.
They ran short videos to show that their frames make great holiday gifts, and Instagram Stories generated over 25% of their new customer sales.
Last week, I was in Europe and met with SMEs from across the continent who shared similar stories of growing their companies, hiring people and investing in their communities.
But over time, we expect family metrics will play the primary role in how we talk about our company and we will eventually phase out Facebook-only community metrics.
Impression growth was primarily driven by ads on Instagram, including both feed and Stories as well as Facebook mobile News Feed.
On a full year basis, we continue to expect 2019 total expenses will grow approximately 40% to 50% compared to 2018.
Could you just talk to sort of which forms of media, whether it's News Feed or Stories or Instagram, kind of came in better than you thought it originally would a few months ago and what drove the upside?
Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Evercore.

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
And I mean, we're working with folks to enable that but I think that, that would be good for people everywhere to make sure that basically every person who uses an Internet service has the same protections no matter where they live.
Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi.

facebook,q1,2019,"WeÃ¢ÂÂre continuing to see fast adoption of Stories with each of our three Stories experiences Ã¢ÂÂ Facebook and Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp Ã¢ÂÂ having more than half a billion daily actives.
For the last 15 years, Facebook and Instagram have become the digital equivalents of the town square where you can do almost anything you want with lots of people at once Ã¢ÂÂ stay in touch with your friends, meet new people, find communities that share your interests, start businesses, buy and sell things, and organize fundraisers for causes.
Today, people increasingly want the intimacy of connecting privately as well, so I think there also needs to be a digital equivalent of the living room, a platform just as built out with all the ways that youÃ¢ÂÂd want to interact privately.
I expect the digital town squares like Facebook and Instagram will always be important and will only continue to grow in importance, but thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot more to build there as well and IÃ¢ÂÂm excited about that.
There are a lot of open questions and real tradeoffs on important social issues, so weÃ¢ÂÂre committed to working openly on this and consulting with experts and governments as we go.
In thinking about the opportunity and impact to our business, by far the most important factor will be whether people choose to use our products and whether we can build the leading private social platforms in most countries.
People want a private social platform that is as strong on privacy as possible, so delivering this is both in the interest of our community and our business.
And the reason I wrote this is because IÃ¢ÂÂve spent most of the last couple of years focused on addressing the important social issues around the internet, and while IÃ¢ÂÂm proud of the progress weÃ¢ÂÂve made, these are areas, where it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt feel right for a private company to make such important policy decisions by ourselves.
If the rules for the internet were being written from scratch today, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think people would want private companies to be making so many decisions around speech, elections, and data privacy without a more robust democratic process.
So, over the long-term, I believe that that increase in the trustworthiness of the internet can have a much larger positive impact for our community and our business than any short-term hit that weÃ¢ÂÂre going to take.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre making significant investments in safety and security while continuing to grow our community and our business.
Going forward, we will continue making investments to increase transparency, protect our platform from interference, and help keep people safe.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre doing this, because itÃ¢ÂÂs the right thing to do for people, and because itÃ¢ÂÂs good for our business over the long-term.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre proud to announce that we now have 3 million advertisers using Stories Ads to reach customers across Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger.
In addition to helping advertisers make the shift to new ads experiences, weÃ¢ÂÂre making it easier for people to shop directly on our apps.
I also want to thank the Facebook teams who drive that growth, while also making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company.
Note that this does not change our longer-term outlook on the need to invest in core product, infrastructure, innovation, and safety and security, and the ultimate impact of those investments on our operating margin.
So weÃ¢ÂÂll talk about both of these things over Ã¢ÂÂ a lot over the coming months and the plan Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂll share a little bit more at F8 next week in terms of the product roadmap and what we expect to see on this.
So when I first announced that we were going to be moving our private communication services to all be end-to-end encrypted, I was very clear that weÃ¢ÂÂre planning on taking at least a year to go consult with experts and governments and law enforcements around the world to make sure that we have the right safety systems in place to make sure that we handle this really well, right?
In countries where we already are the leading platform, there will be more ability to work on things like payments in the near term and build in additional ways that people want to interact privately.
But in terms of when I expect this to be a real contributor to the business, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think in the next couple of years thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a major driver.
So the long run view should be that you can give us maybe simple pictures, maybe simple videos, maybe an ad youÃ¢ÂÂve produced, and we can do the placement for you, because we think over time our systems will do a better job deciding where your ads should be placed and even helping you target until youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing us build tools in that direction as well.
And then when it comes to how weÃ¢ÂÂre thinking about expense growth as we look beyond 2019, weÃ¢ÂÂre not providing specific guidance but IÃ¢ÂÂd note that we continue to invest aggressively across the business and thereÃ¢ÂÂs no change in our long-term outlook on the need to invest heavily in areas like safety and security, innovation in our core product and infrastructure and the ultimate impact that those will have on our operating margin.
I care a lot about making sure that we want make the right investments in safety and innovation long-term, so IÃ¢ÂÂm committed to doing that.
ThereÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs early, but one of the big questions around Watch that we had early on was what is going to be peopleÃ¢ÂÂs demand to go to a separate tab to have an experience thatÃ¢ÂÂs dedicated to interacting with people around a certain type of content?
So, it was really important to me, and I think to making Ã¢ÂÂ to the long term of what our product stands for it to make sure that News Feed is always about meaningful interaction.
Advertising is going to be the way that the revenue comes in for the foreseeable future, but what we expect is as we build out more commerce-related features around shopping, and Instagram and Marketplace and Facebook and certainly, the private social platform that weÃ¢ÂÂre Ã¢ÂÂ that IÃ¢ÂÂve been talking about I think will lend itself to private interactions around payments and commerce and interacting with businesses in that way, I think what weÃ¢ÂÂre going this is weÃ¢ÂÂre going to build more tools for people to buy things directly through the platform.
But I would just note that we are not changing our overall philosophy of continuing to invest aggressively across the business in these important areas like safety, and security and innovation, which are going to play into continued expense growth both in 2019 and 2020.
And at the same time we're seeing continued pricing growth on feed, and that's true for both Facebook and Instagram.
So on Facebook Stories, we have 0.5 billion people using it daily, and we think that's pretty impressive growth; we're seeing real engagement.
In ads in Stories, we rolled out globally about 1.5 years after launching Instagram so it's still early but we're definitely seeing a lot of value for businesses on Instagram, and we believe same on Facebook.
So I just Ã¢ÂÂ I think it's something we'll be watching and nurturing but it's going to take a while before Instagram Shopping has any meaningful impact on the business.
So on safety, I think given the volume of content that people share, if you want to have any hope of doing it in real time, the only hope is building AI systems that can either identify things and handle them proactively or at the very least, flag them for a lot of people who work for us who can then look at them rather than waiting for people in our community to flag those after they've already seen them.
Most of what we build Ã¢ÂÂ one of the things thatÃ¢ÂÂs different about Facebook and social products is more of it is about people interacting with each other than just people interacting with us, right?
And so weÃ¢ÂÂre certainly very focused on things like video calling and voice calling and ways that people can communicate with voice.
Sheryl Sandberg Ã¢ÂÂ Chief Operating Officer
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
For elections, there have long been laws defining what is political advertising, but we need to update those regulations to reflect todayÃ¢ÂÂs threats like the ways that foreign nation states try to interfere in elections now.
We also introduced Ã¢ÂÂWhy am I seeing this post?Ã¢ÂÂ so people can learn more about what shows up in their News Feed and change their preferences to make their Facebook experience more personal.
When DunkinÃ¢ÂÂ promoted its donut fries with an interactive poll in their Stories ads, more than one in five people, who saw the ad voted, which increased engagement and drove 20% lower cost per video view.
Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with the first quarter of 2018, total revenue would have been approximately $503 million higher.
Absent this accrual our total expense growth rate would have been 46 percentage points lower.
The $3 billion accrual accounts for approximately 10 percentage points of the anticipated expense growth.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Your next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
ThereÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ definitely has to be some cannibalization for people who are doing feed ads as they get Stories.
That means those people are seeing less relevant ads and thatÃ¢ÂÂs an ad targeting headwind for our business.
Your next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Your next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
As well as weÃ¢ÂÂre making our own product changes with things like tools for seeing and clearing your off-Facebook history and restricting use of some ad targeting.

facebook,q2,2019,"Mark Zuckerberg Ã¢ÂÂ Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Sheryl Sandberg Ã¢ÂÂ Chief Operating Officer
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
This will require investing a significant amount of our engineering resources in building tools to review our products in the ways we use data.
After next year, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to publish these reports quarterly, so people can hold us accountable at the same cadence as these earnings calls.
We also continue to invest heavily in protecting elections Ã¢ÂÂ including more advanced efforts to stop coordinated inauthentic behavior, new ads transparency tools, and more fact-checking partnerships.
With that foundation, weÃ¢ÂÂre starting to explore how a private social platform could become the center of your social experience, for example, by bringing together all of your ephemeral stories from your different apps into one place.
With WhatsApp, which already has incredibly strong privacy and performance, weÃ¢ÂÂre more focused on building out all the ways youÃ¢ÂÂd want to interact in this digital living room.
With millions of small businesses using WhatsApp Business, weÃ¢ÂÂre also building new tools like product catalogs that entrepreneurs around the world can use for free.
This matters especially for the growing number of small businesses that donÃ¢ÂÂt have a web presence or that use private messaging platforms like WhatsApp as their main way of interacting with customers.
Instagram Shopping will improve the experience of browsing and shopping from your favorite brands and creators, while also giving emerging creators a powerful new way to build a business and sustain their community.
The third product area I want to highlight where weÃ¢ÂÂre focused on delivering a qualitatively better experience than what exists today is in the future computing platforms of augmented and virtual reality.
This quarter, we launched our latest variation Ã¢ÂÂ Dynamic Ads in Instagram Stories Ã¢ÂÂ which show people ads for products theyÃ¢ÂÂve already browsed on a retailerÃ¢ÂÂs website or app.
Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with the second quarter of 2018, total revenue would have been approximately $574 million higher.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
I think one of the challenges weÃ¢ÂÂve had is training the market that you canÃ¢ÂÂt just take your TV ads and put them on video Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry, put them on mobile or put them into Facebook, because they donÃ¢ÂÂt perform the same way.
McDonalds used mobile app video ads in Facebook and Instagram News Feed and Stories to launch a limited edition called the Big Mac range in the UK.
We are seeing faster growth in impressions coming from Stories and then also coming from geographies that monetize at lower rates on things like Facebook News Feed.
But the privacy efforts do require significant investments obviously and compliance processes, people and then technical infrastructure and those are factored into the 2019 operating expense outlook.
IÃ¢ÂÂm just wondering if you could share what the feedback has been so far from the brands that are in the closed beta and how this has helped maybe some stats if they have them like how it helped maybe conversion for the brands that are doing it versus maybe the traditional way they were selling on Instagram.
Your next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Your next question comes from Mark May from Citi.
Yes. Our current outlook for 2019 does suggests that weÃ¢ÂÂll see margins come down this year versus 2018.
So rather than go to every advertiser both through our sales force and through our online tools where we sell and say we have a new format, you need to create the new format, you need to figure out the placement being able to just take what they are already doing like Feed ads, converted into Stories and place at anywhere helps us move people into these formats.
IÃ¢ÂÂll say one more thing, which is that Stories donÃ¢ÂÂt monetize right now at the same rate as News Feed.
Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre very focused on payments with fiat currencies as well and making it so that when you pay in one service, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs WhatsApp or in Instagram Shopping or in Marketplace your credentials can be shared and thereÃ¢ÂÂs a shared payment system across all those things.
Your last question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.
Our community and business continue to grow, and there are now more than 2.7 billion people using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger each month, and more than 2.1 billion people who use at least one of our services each day.
We continue to focus on our four priorities for the year, making progress on the major social issues, building qualitatively new experiences, building our business, and communicating what we stand for more transparently.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs going to take time to do this properly, and I expect it will take us longer to ship new products, especially while weÃ¢ÂÂre getting this up and running.
I also expect that just as with the work we have been doing on safety and integrity, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue to identify and fix issues as we develop our systems.
Next, I know thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot to discuss in terms of policy, but I also want to discuss our second priority Ã¢ÂÂ delivering qualitatively new experiences for our community.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre very focused on delivering this over the next five years, building on the foundation we have with Messenger and WhatsApp. With Messenger, weÃ¢ÂÂre rewriting the app from scratch to make it the fastest and most secure major messaging platform in the world, and weÃ¢ÂÂre working towards making end-to-end encryption and reduced permanence, the default for all conversations.
These are huge and important spaces, and we have efforts in several major areas to deliver qualitatively better experiences than what exists today from Instagram Shopping to Facebook Marketplace to payments across our apps to the new Libra project that we announced with 27 other companies recently.
In the future, weÃ¢ÂÂll enable people to use the same payments account to send money to friends and businesses on WhatsApp, shop on Instagram, or make transactions on Facebook.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs my update on our work on the major social issues we face and building new product experiences.
But this was also an important quarter because now we have a clearer path forward Ã¢ÂÂ not just in terms of product and business, but in terms of guidance from regulators, which sets clear expectations and gives us a foundation to build on.
As weÃ¢ÂÂve been discussing, weÃ¢ÂÂre making significant investments in safety, security and privacy while continuing to grow our community and our business.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue to make investments to protect our platform, because itÃ¢ÂÂs the right thing to do and itÃ¢ÂÂs good for our business over the long-term.
In addition to improving our ad tools, weÃ¢ÂÂre investing in new ways for people to discover products, engage with brands and shop on our platforms.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre continuing our closed beta of Checkout on Instagram and we launched a new feature this quarter that enables Creators to tag products in their posts.
I also want to thank the Facebook teams, who drive that growth and are making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre pleased with the further growth of our community and business while we continue to make significant investments in privacy, safety and security.
So, while a lot of the content is still provided by people in a way that weÃ¢ÂÂre not covering costs, we do have a strategy of investing in great content that really starts the flywheel growing Ã¢ÂÂ going and weÃ¢ÂÂve been pretty pleased, I mean itÃ¢ÂÂs not the biggest effort anyone has, but weÃ¢ÂÂve had some hits from Tom and Time to Tom and Time to Red Table Talk ,sorry for your loss, and weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing some really nice engagement numbers on these shows.
And the best of them actually carry over into the Facebook community, because the best of the people creating those shows and starring in those shows are also engaging with Facebook, and I think the vision Mark laid out for this all along is that, we should do video in a pretty social way.
Ross, I mean if you remember weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing good impression growth across Instagram Stories, Instagram Feed and Facebook Feed.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve opened a period of, however, long it takes to address regulators and different experts and constituents questions about this and then figure out what the best way to move forward is and thatÃ¢ÂÂs certainly what weÃ¢ÂÂre planning to do with Libra.
I think the way to think about checkout is kind of in a larger picture of what weÃ¢ÂÂre trying to do in terms of commerce and shopping on our services and apps across the board, which is, we obviously have a lot of consumer engagement in our products and thatÃ¢ÂÂs great.
But I will take a minute to talk about Stories ads in general, because I think eventually depending on our ability to use data across platform that applies to WhatsApp itÃ¢ÂÂs probably pretty important part of the story thatÃ¢ÂÂs going on with Facebook right now.
So we do have Stories ads available across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, and I think one of the most important things we learned as we were doing it transition to mobile is if we made it easy for our advertisers to place the ads, make sure they understood the measurement they were having and also make sure the ad format worked, businesses would move more quickly.
But I think one of the successes you are seeing weÃ¢ÂÂre having right now is that we are helping people move to Stories more quickly because of the lessons we learned.
So weÃ¢ÂÂre certainly seeing good growth in places where Instagram is strong, including the U.S., so thatÃ¢ÂÂs been good to see.
So, I think weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing good growth on Instagram.
I mean the way that we kind of see the products now is weÃ¢ÂÂve helped people map out and wire up their networks over the last several years, and now in each of these apps we have opportunities to help people get more value from the networks that theyÃ¢ÂÂve created in some of that is going to be on the social side, especially around creating communities and groups and some of it is going to be more on the economic and opportunity side and there weÃ¢ÂÂre doing a whole lot of projects.
And in Marketplace, we definitely are going to focus on some of the areas that you talked about including jobs is already a pretty meaningful focus where a lot of people do find jobs and business is less jobs through Facebook.
So in the Facebook app overall after helping people connect with friends and family, helping people connected with communities is the next most important social problem that we believe we can help address and thatÃ¢ÂÂs just going to be an area of increasing value in the product.
But before this is really the biggest driver of our business, I do think that thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a number of years.

facebook,q3,2019,"We're making progress building out the private social platform across WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram Direct, and we have multiple exciting initiatives around commerce and payments that we're moving forward from marketplace to Instagram Shopping to payments in WhatsApp and continuing our discussion on Libra.
Those who follow us closely know that we have more than 35,000 people working on safety and security, and that our budget for this work is billions of dollars a year, more than the whole revenue of our Company at the time of our IPO earlier this decade.
But while we work hard to remove content that can cause real danger, I think we also need to be careful about adopting more and more rules that restrict the way that people can speak and what they can say.
And we do this because we know that if we help people have meaningful interactions that they'll find our services more valuable and that's the key to building something sustainable and growing over time.
I guess that some people are going to think that these decisions may have a negative impact on things that they really care about.
In addition to these challenges, there are a lot of great things that are going on that I am incredibly proud of and excited about and I'm glad that our community and business trends continue heading in a good direction.
We know we have a very important responsibility to keep people safe and continue innovating to help businesses of all sizes grow.
Now advertisers in these areas are required to use a new buying process and by the end of the year people will be able to view all current housing ads in the United States.
I also want to thank the Facebook teams who are deeply committed to making progress on the major social issues facing the Internet and our Company and driving growth for businesses.
In terms of our Family metrics, we continue to grow and estimate that on average around 2.2 billion people use at least one of our apps on a daily basis in September and around 2.8 billion were active on a monthly basis.
As a reminder, the Family metrics are best estimate of our de-duplicated audience across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. We believe that these numbers better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our services.
As I indicated on our second quarter call, we continue to expect a more pronounced deceleration of our revenue growth rate in Q4.
At the same time, we continue to make investments in important areas like privacy, safety and innovation.
I don't think we have any new status to share on this, but I mean overall we rolled out the tab for -- almost the first year we were really tuning it just to make sure that it would be retentive and very valuable for people.
So they are in general -- the way we think about this stuff is, we try not to put something in front of a lot of people unless we're confident that they're going to find it useful and want to come back and use it multiple times and we can put a lot of things in front of people not to try it once, but we want to wait until things are kind of retentive and useful.
The premium content part of it, yes, I think the right way to think about this is almost as marketing to help people try out the tab for the first time.
There are some good tent pole pieces of content that people really love that they come and they check out the product to experience that and then they stay for a lot of the other valuable content that's in there and that might not be talked about as much in the news.
And going to the Q4 guide, is there any color you can give us on how different regions of the world might be impacted against the mid to high single-digit deceleration of the levels of Q3 just so we have a better understanding of where you might be seeing some of those tougher comps or product optimizations play out on a global scale.
In the US, we will have a shorter holiday season, it's hard to know how that's going to play into it just given the late arrival of Thanksgiving, but I think overall the product optimizations that we're comping against in Q4 were global changes.
We're now monetizing with that product and more advertisers are buying from it and then Sheryl is going to jump in and I think give some additional color.
Yes, I think in terms of our core advertising products and growth, it's worth really remembering that our core feed products for Facebook and Instagram are growing nicely and well.
I think we've taken our experience on how to help advertisers migrate to the right places and been able to do that even more quickly in new formats like Stories.
So on that, I think what we're continuing to see with Stories monetization is, that is a product that's experiencing a lot of impression growth.
And I'm still optimistic, I think that the long-term vision and the reasons why I thought this -- we're going to be important and big are unchanged.
So we're seeing a lot of people use these products and love them and because of that I think that we're still going to get there.
So every year that we get to practice and get better and build our brand around Oculus in terms of building the best products that we can in this space, I just think that we're going to be better off when this is really ready to be a completely mainstream thing with hundreds of millions of people using it.
Over time it's an opportunity to maybe slow down the growth, but it's not going to change the dynamics in the near term.
I mean, look, I think a lot of the antitrust questions that are out there that are going to be about our acquisition of Instagram, right.
So we were competing there with things like Facebook camera, but we ultimately thought that we were going to do better work if we were building with Instagram.
It's the test really shows that a lot of people are going to want to use this product.
And one of the questions that we had was, there are of course a lot of things that some people want to do, but not everyone and we weren't sure if we were going to be able to build a secondary tab in the app that could be meaningful even if most people didn't use them.
It took us a little while to really get it to work the way that we wanted, but now it's growing quickly, that's going to be hundreds of millions of people who are using it.
So I think in the future if this works out, what we're going to see is that how people use the Facebook app is going to be, they're going to keep on using News Feed, they are going to keep on sharing with friends and family, but the average person will also probably have one, two or three other apps or kind of secondary tabs that they use that are quite useful for them in connecting with their broader community on Facebook.
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO and Dave Wehner, CFO.
We also recently released - now that we estimate that more than 140 million businesses, mostly small businesses are using our services each month to grow, create jobs and become social hubs in their communities.
Core values on voice and free expression are not partisans, but unfortunately in our current environment a lot of people look at every decision through the lens of whether it's going to help or hurt the candidate they want in winning their next election.
I could be wrong, but my experience running this Company so far has been that if we do what we believe is right, even when it's unpopular for years at a time, then eventually it has worked out best for our community and for our business too.
And as these systems compete, the question of which nation's values will determine what speech has allowed for decades to come really puts into perspective the issues that we face today because while we may disagree on exactly where to draw the line on specific issues, we at least can disagree and that's what free expression is about.
We did that by improving our ads products and creating new formats to help advertisers more easily reach their current and future customers.
We are continually making these basis point improvements to help advertisers save time and money and build their business.
We also continue to build new formats that enable brands to interact with people in fun and engaging ways and make commerce more convenient.

We face a very wide range of issues here from really hard technological problems to issues scaling large organizations to of course a lot of now major regulatory and social issues and having different people or different perspectives can help us navigate that and provide both advice and oversight to make sure that we're doing a good job is really important.

How long does this have to be as resource-intensive from a people perspective or do you see the ability over time as with technologies like AI potentially helping you to get more leverage out of this existing budget, so maybe you don't have to continue to ramp it as quickly as your user base and engagement continues to grow.
Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.
But if you remember at the time, Instagram was focused on helping people take photos, apply creative filters and share them publicly across different social networks including Facebook.
But remember that a lot of the other services that were Instagram's peers and were growing quickly at the time including startups with strong teams and very talented founders like Path don't really even exist today anymore.
Instagram wouldn't be what it is today without Kevin and Mike who are just really incredible product leaders and of course did a lot of amazing work.
We have different competitors in the space today like Snapchat, which shows that people are always building new ideas.
Your last question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson from Moffett Nathanson.
And surely even though not everyone comes to Facebook, because they want high quality news , I believe that there are going to be, whether it's 10% or 20% at a floor who I think would really want something like this.

facebook,q4,2019,"Last year, I shared our four company priorities, and they're still our priorities in 2020: making progress on the major social issues, building qualitatively new product experiences, continuing to grow our business, and getting out there and communicating more transparently.
Today, I'm going to focus mostly on the new product experiences we're building, but before I get to that, this is going to be another critical year for making progress on social issues.
We were behind in 2016, but after working to protect elections in countries across the world from the EU -- in the EU to India to Mexico to the U.S. midterms for the past few years, we think our systems are now more advanced than any other companies.
Related to this, just yesterday, we announced that we're rolling out a Privacy Checkup tool to nearly 2 billion people, reminding them of the controls they have and making sure that they're set the way that they want them.
So during this, our job is to keep doing what we think is right on the social issues and to stay focused on continuing to deliver product improvements and better experiences for our community.
The product areas that I'm most focused on for the next chapter of our company are building out the private social platform and more intimate communities, enabling more commerce and payments and delivering the next computing platform.
When I look at the Internet today, we all have this ability to connect with people, content, and opportunities coming from all around the world in ways that were unimaginable just a generation ago.
And across our services, the greatest growth in how people are communicating continues to come from private messaging, small groups, and disappearing stories where your data doesn't stick around forever.
While the Facebook and Instagram apps have developed with lots of different ways to interact with the people you care about, our private communication apps are still pretty much just about texting, so we spent the last year building infrastructure to turn our private messaging apps, WhatsApp and Messenger into richer, private social platforms where you can hang out and be present with friends, find groups with your interest, engage with businesses more naturally.
Commerce and payments is another area that will be important for the private social platform, but also across all of our apps, including Facebook and Instagram.
On the AR side, while we're working on the long-term hardware and operating system, it's worth noting that our Spark AR platform is the most widely used AR platform in the world with hundreds of millions of people interacting with effects every month.
We're focused on creating value over the long term for our community and for the 140 million businesses around the world who use our platform to connect with customers and grow.
As a reminder, the family metrics are our best estimate of the deduplicated audience across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. We believe these numbers better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people use more than one of our services.
And then, Dave, I guess to go back to your comment about the majority of the impact that lies ahead when you're thinking about ad targeting and privacy regulation, is there any more detail you can give us as sort of types of data or types of sort of breakage that you see as potential risk to the targeting and the efficacy of the ads going forward?
So when you think about the shopping experience or the checkout experience on Instagram, these are still very early days, and we're working hard to improve the product and expand to more businesses.
And I think it's important to note that the regulatory and platform changes will have a disproportionate impact on the ability of small businesses to use ads to grow and thrive.
And how are you going about the integration work that needs to be done to make the experience seamless, where you could kind of match inventory levels with what people are actually buying?
We continue to see growth across Facebook, across Instagram in people who are discovering products they're interested in, and we're continuing to make a lot of investments there.
A lot of the work that we end up doing goes towards making it easier for small businesses to be able to -- without a big technology shop, be able to use the same tools, get access to payments, set up storefronts easily, being able to measure the effectiveness of ads.
And then following up on the comment on messaging, I wondered if we can get an update on the way the team is thinking about the messaging component on a monetization front and thinking about some of the more interesting products you might use to monetize the messaging applications, both Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp as you look out over the next couple of years.
We want to make it so that features that get built across Instagram or Facebook or WhatsApp and when people engage on those, it can also make your experience better across the other apps in the family, too.
And we think, in many ways, we're better positioned than anyone else in the industry to participate in the opportunity that should be there over the long run for businesses and consumers to connect on message.
We don't have that rolled out in WhatsApp. Where we are seeing a lot of growth and really exciting metrics right now are click-to-messaging ads.
And so we think the combination of the discovery ads that we can do, clicking through the Messenger right now already shows the potential of how important messaging can be for businesses.
Overall, I mean the way that Dating fits into the strategy here is within the Facebook app, we think that News Feed is really central and that it's one of the only things that we think everyone who uses the app is really going to use on a daily basis.
So I kind of expect in a year or 2, the world that we're going to be in is people use Facebook, they're going to use News Feed, and then they're probably each going to have 2 or 3 other of these social utilities that they find valuable.
And as we start building those, I think that that's some part of the story that you're seeing on why the Facebook app engagement has been strong recently is -- especially as we build more of these things that certainly is showing up in how people use the app.
And I do think that there is going to be a lot that we need to be watching out for this year.
And in Facebook and Instagram, you can interact with a lot of people you know or interested in connecting with them in a number of different ways.
So a lot of what we've been trying to do is make it so that we build out the infrastructure, so that way WhatsApp and Messenger and Instagram direct can evolve rather than being just places where you message folks.
And then I'd say across all of our apps, we're seeing strong adoption of Stories and, on WhatsApp Status products around the world, and that continues to provide another way for people to connect and share.
So this is going to be one of the increasing focuses for us or just the different ways that people want to interact and build communities.
We're not just trying to build things that everyone is going to want to use.
We think something like gaming, hundreds of millions of people are going to want to use it, and that's great.
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements.
Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
But we should start seeing more new experiences later this year, and this will all be built on a very strong privacy foundation.
So we're taking a number of different approaches here, ranging from people buying and selling to each other directly to businesses setting up storefronts, to people engaging with businesses directly through messaging and a number of things on payments ranging from existing -- using existing national systems like India's UPI to creating new global systems.
Having small businesses succeed is not only key to creating broad economic growth where everyone can support themselves, it's also important to maintaining healthy communities since small businesses are often where people come together.
And it's going to let us build things that we've only dreamed of for the last 15 years, like letting people interact as if they're in person together no matter where they are or letting people live wherever they want and hologram into work so they can access opportunities anywhere and don't have to move to a city or another country to find a job.
So we're going to focus more on communicating our principles, whether that's standing up for giving people a voice against those who would censor people who don't agree with them, standing up for letting people build their own communities against those who say that the new types of communities forming on social media are dividing us, standing up for encryption against those who say that privacy mostly helps bad people, standing up for -- giving small businesses more opportunity and sophisticated tools against those who say that targeted advertising is a problem, or standing up for serving every person in the world against those who say that you have to pay a premium in order to really be served.
This really matters because as Mark said, when businesses of all sizes succeed, they hire people and invest in their communities.
According to 7,000 companies surveyed across 15 EU countries, our apps helped businesses contribute about EUR 200 billion to the European economy just last year.
I also want to thank our teams around the world for working to solve tough challenges while still building great products that businesses use to grow, compete and hire.
Full year 2019 revenue grew 27% to $71 billion, and we generated over $18 billion in net income.
Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q4 of last year, total revenue would have been approximately $295 million higher.
R&D grew 36% and was driven primarily by increased investments in core product as well as our innovation efforts particularly in AR/VR.
Full year capital expenditures were $15.7 billion, up 12%, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings and network infrastructure.
Factors driving this deceleration include the maturity of our business as well as the increasing impact from global privacy regulation and other ad targeting-related headwinds.
Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Dave, has anything changed since third quarter when we're looking at less deceleration this year?
Yes. In addition, growth in infrastructure spend is our large increase in CapEx over the last several years, flows through the income statement as another driver of our expense growth as well.
Following up on the shopping commerce question, I wonder if the focus here includes expanding Marketplace across multiple services or if that seems like better as a distinct application.
Yes. I've been talking a lot about how we're trying to build out our private messaging apps into richer, private social platforms.

For other types of misinformation, we partner with independent fact checkers who have marked more than 4,000 pieces of content related to COVID as false, which has resulted in more than 40 million warning labels being seen across our services, and we know that these work because 95% of the time when someone sees a warning label, they don't click through to view that content.
And since people experiencing symptoms is a precursor to them going to the hospital or getting more seriously ill, this tool can help local governments and health officials plan how to allocate scarce resources like PPE and ventilators as well as determine when it's safe to start reopening an area or when an area will need to have tighter shelter orders if symptoms reemerge.
Now, outside of Facebook, Priscilla and my work at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative with alongside leading experts in science and health continues to inform my views on the best ways for us to assist in this health response and also what we should expect going forward with this disease.
The investments we've made in shared infrastructure that cover all of our different services over the years has helped us manage through this, but it has been a challenge while all our teams have been working remotely.
People used to primarily live stream physical events, but it's almost known as planning physical events right now livestreaming has become the primary venue for many events, whether that's the Pope's weekly mass on Facebook Live or DJs hosting dance parties on Instagram, every day more than 800 million daily actives are engaging with live streams, across workout classes, concerts and more.
Sheryl, will talk about this more, but with so many businesses forced to close their physical storefronts, more are looking to build their digital presences and those which already invested in their digital presences are increasingly viewing them as the primary storefronts.
Mark talked about how our company has responded during this emergency to keep people safe and informed.
Our teams moved quickly to make gift cards available on both Facebook and Instagram giving customers the option to support businesses by paying upfront for products and services they can use later.
We also launched temporary service changes to make it easier for businesses to share critical information like inventory updates, shipment details, or new ways to buy.
I also want to thank our teams for ensuring our services keep running and working so hard to launch new products, so we can continue making a real difference in people's lives.
We are currently operating with over 95% of our full-time employees working from home with safety being the number one priority for those essential workers who need to come into our data centers and other facilities.
While we are by no means operating at 100% of capacity across every dimension of our operations, we have continued to ship new product releases, maintain service availability, review content and stay connected with our business customers.
While this reflects a moderate reduction in the planned growth rate of total expenses, our overall expense growth in the face of expected revenue weakness will have a negative impact on our 2020 operating margins.

Your last question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.
So, with that said, I want to use this time today to discuss how we're responding to COVID, what we're seeing across our services, and some reflections on how we plan to run the company going forward.
So, responses have been focused on three areas; helping people stay connected while we're all apart, assisting the public health response, and working on the economic recovery especially for small businesses.
So, this is work that we're uniquely positioned to do, because Facebook is a global community and people use their authentic identities on our service, so that means that we can make sure that the data is meaningful.
In many of the places that have been hardest hit by the virus, messaging volume has increased more than 50%, and voice and video calling has more than doubled across Messenger and WhatsApp. In Italy, for example, we've seen up to 70% more time spent across our apps.
Instagram and Facebook Live views doubled in one week, and we've also seen time in Group video calling increase by more than a 1000% over March.
But in some areas, I think we are seeing an acceleration in pre-existing long-term trends like the dramatic increase in online private social communication that is likely to continue.
The last area of our response that I want to discuss is how we're helping with the economic recovery, especially for small businesses.
So this is a moment where we feel that we're well positioned to be champions for small businesses interests and supporters of important infrastructure that they're going to need in order to move online.
The largest Facebook and WhatsApp communities in the world are in India, and we think that there is an especially important opportunity to serve small businesses and enable commerce there over the long-term.
By bringing together JioMart, which is Jio's small business initiative to connect millions of shops across India with WhatsApp, we think that we're going to able to create a much better shopping and commerce experience.
Along with our strong financial position and the important social value our services provide, we're planning to hire at least 10,000 more people in product and engineering roles this year, so we can continue building and making progress.
As our services play in an especially important role right now, in helping people stay connected and assisting the public health response and working on the economic recovery, I really want to thank all of our employees who are working hard to deliver these services and everyone who has believed in us and supported our company over the years to help us get to the point where we can deliver these services for people around the world.
With more people spending time on our products and services than ever before, we are focused on continuing to deliver free and paid tools to help businesses reach the right people at the right time.
We can continue to pay all of our employees and contractors during this difficult time, which is why we believe we have a real responsibility to help others, especially small businesses around the world.
We have seen increased usage across all of our services, particularly in markets that have been most impacted by the virus, including a surge in video and voice calling on Messenger and WhatsApp. People around the world have increasingly turned to Facebook as well.
With the COVID-19 crisis like all companies we are facing a period of unprecedented uncertainty in our business outlook, certainly in the nearly eight years I've been with Facebook.
And then the second question for Mark, you talked a little bit about SMBs. I'm curious to hear about some of the key investment areas and initiatives you really think you need to execute on to make the SMB offering more comprehensive in '21 and beyond?
So, Brian, yes, the trends that we saw in the end of Q1, we saw pull back, pretty broad based pull back especially concentrated in some of the areas that we talked about, things like travel and auto, but really kind of broad-based, large and small advertisers.
I mean for commerce on WhatsApp more broadly, we're very focused on making it, so that small businesses can have a presence on all of the apps, right, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger and can communicate organically with people and then increasingly can do things that can help them drive transactions.
So we started rolling out things like catalogs in WhatsApp, we're working on payments to be able to complete transactions, and we've rolled out a new ad format, click to messaging ads, where basically a lot of small businesses and different businesses are finding that their message threads with people perform better for driving sales than their websites or other presences.
It's hard to know what is just correlated with the pandemic versus people are doing more video chat or messaging, so therefore they also connect more in other parts of the products, but I do think, overall, we believe that providing a broad set of social tools for people is -- and just providing more value for people does include all of the different services which is important because as you know, some of the services for our business we include ads in and some we don't.
It continues to drive our business and I would say if anything COVID is accentuated the importance of people who are bidding for online conversions.
And then second question is Mark, you mentioned in your opening remarks that something along the lines of high margins are important to the company, especially given the economic environment.
So that way when we go through periods like this, you can make sure that we remain stable and healthy and able to keep on building the things that are important for the long term.
I do think that it's one of those areas where as people can't go out into the world as much, the ability to have technology that allows us to be physically present or feel present even when we can be physically together, whether that's Quest or Portal or any of the software that we're building around video presence that stuff is certainly seen especially large spikes in usage and it's possible that this brings accelerate some of the trends around adoption of things like virtual or augmented reality.
And we'll certainly want to accelerate that aspect of our product road map to make sure that we can serve a lot of those businesses during this period when it can help them with the recovery and get through this.
The other question was monetization on WhatsApp. I think that there is a huge opportunity on WhatsApp if for no other reason than that it has 2 billion people using it and we haven't done significant work on building out the business yet.
So it's -- there is tremendous demand people want to communicate with businesses and we've been in the process of building out the infrastructure to do payments and more commerce, ad units like what I mentioned around quick to messaging ads are performing well.
