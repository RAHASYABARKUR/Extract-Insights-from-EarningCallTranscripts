wellsfargo,q2,2015,"Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss second quarter result and answer your questions.
We earned $5.7 billion in the second quarter, as our diversified business model continued to generate strong loan and deposit growth.
Our growth benefited from the $11.5 billion GE Capital loan purchasing and financing transaction in the second quarter.
Our credit performance continued to improve and our net charge-off rate declined to 30 basis points of average loans, the lowest level in 20 years.
On Page 3, we highlight the year-over-year growth John emphasized in his remarks including revenue, loans, deposits and EPS as well as improving credit.
Revenue increased $40 million from first quarter with strong growth in net interest income, up $284 million reflecting growth in earning assets.
We had linked quarter growth and fee income in most of our customer-facing businesses including deposit service charges, trust and investment fees, card fees, merchant processing, commercial real estate brokerage, mortgage and insurance.
However, non-interest income declined $244 million from first quarter due to lower market-sensitive revenue and lower other income driven by the accounting impact related to our debt hedges.
ItÂs also important to note that we didnÂt acquire these loans until late in the quarter, so while it increased ending loan balances, most of the benefit to average loans and to net interest income will be reflected in the third quarter.
Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $15 billion or 7% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high-quality non-conforming mortgages.
Credit card balances were up $3.9 billion or 14% from a year ago, benefiting from strong new account growth and the DillardÂs portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year.
New originations reflected the strong auto market and were up 5% from a year ago and up 15% from first quarter benefiting from seasonality.
Our earning asset mix results and diversified Â results and diversified sources of interest income, the drivers of our fee generation are also diverse and vary based on interest rate and economic conditions, for example, market-sensitive revenue which includes trading gains from our Â trading and gains from our debt and equity investments declined 21% from first quarter, market-sensitive revenue was 8% of our fee income in the second quarter, down from 11% in the first quarter, however, many of our other customer-facing businesses generated higher fee income.
We grew net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by %524 million or 5% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in average earning assets, up 11% from a year ago.
The $312 million increase in net interest income from first quarter reflected growth in earning assets and one extra day in the quarter.
Net interest income also benefited from increased income from variable sources, lower deposit cost and higher income from interest rate swaps used to convert a portion of our floating rate commercial loans to fixed rate as we continue to add duration to our balance sheet.
The increase this quarter was driven by balance sheet repricing and growth including growth in investments and loans and lower deposit cost which benefited the margin by 4 basis points.
The other non-interest income category was down $426 million in the second quarter driven by the accounting impact of interest rate and currency hedges associated with our long-term debt.
ItÂs important to note that while total non-interest income declined, if you exclude market-sensitive revenue and other income, we had strong diversified fee growth across our other fee categories demonstrating growth from doing more business with our customers.
Based on the current rate environment, the level of our pipeline and the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, we currently expect originations in the third quarter to be lower than the second quarter.
While we continue to invest in our businesses reflected in higher professional services and advertising expenses in the second quarter, we remained focused on operating efficiently as indicated by our efficiency ratio improving to 58.5%.
Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.4 billion in the second quarter, down 8% from first quarter which included the discrete tax benefit.
This strong growth reflects our success in attracting new customers to Wells Fargo as well as the benefit of better retention of our existing households as we remain focused on meeting their financial needs.
For example, weÂve been successfully growing the penetration rate of credit cards to our retail bank households which has grown to 42.6% in the second quarter, up from 39% a year ago and 34.9% two years ago.
This growth in average loans did not fully reflect the benefit of the GE Capital transaction reported late in the quarter.
The strong loan and deposit growth helps grow revenue by 2% from a year ago.
Our credit losses in our residential real estate portfolios declined 22% and non-accrual loans declined $388 million or 4% from first quarter.
Our energy team completed their spring re-determination process during the second quarter and as expected, the drop in energy prices did impact the cash flow and collateral values of a number of our borrowers leading to downward portfolio migration.
The decline in our net payout ratio reflected our strong asset and RWA growth as our first call for capital is for providing credit to our customers.
In summary, our second quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong loan and deposit growth and momentum in non-interest income across many of our customer-facing businesses.
So, there are variety of loan categories that deserves to be mentioned individually, but you know we are aggressively growing the card business with our existing deposit customers and percentage gains there will probably continue to be very strong.
Still a lot going on in commercial real estate and as you mentioned the GE Capital loans helped us late in the third quarter there.
Jumbo loans on the residential side have been growing on the balance sheet at the same strong pace for a long time and we continue to Â we expect to see that there.
I mean, the outcome is what it is and if we had about a $400 million increase to non-performing assets in energy for the quarter, which feels like it makes sense.
So, we are bumping along here at 30 basis points of annualized net losses on the total loan portfolio and as we called out in the past, we shouldnÂt expect releases in any given quarter because itÂs going to Â the calculation heats quarter of the allowance is going to include the observed portfolio of the portfolio is going to include general economic conditions is going to include where the growth is coming from in the mix in the portfolio.
So, I would not model in release of this magnitude going forward and of course, as weÂve said, we keep building our loan portfolio, youÂd expect to see builds often Â things being equal.
And as I said, I would assume that the next couple of quarters how much better than the last quarter in terms of we are still resolving these issues, some of them are just coming to life for certain borrowers but itÂs a very contained portion of our loan portfolio and the aggregate impact should not be material for Wells Fargo.
Just wanted to take a step back, as we enter potentially a rising rate environment in the second half of the year fingers crossed, one of your peers they meant, mentioned, anticipating a significantly more competitive environment for retail deposits given the regulators have essentially said, there are good deposits and bad deposits this time around.
And to the point of entering new markets, well, we adjust our store footprint meaningfully every year by opening and closing stores where we see fit, I think as Carrie Tolstedt has described in our last Investor Day, we believe that we need a certain amount of scale in any urban market before we can really make a difference and we are in most of the markets that we like to be in, and of course we are not going to get there through acquisitions.
So if there were a bigger RWA opportunity, we would measure where we were starting from, we would understand what sort of capital generation was going on at that time and itÂs possible, we would end up retaining a little bit more in order to maintain satisfactory levels while growing assets.
So, I guess the question is, do you think we're at an inflection point where we'll no longer see deposit growth continue to exceed loan growth and if so, does that suggest that that we should begin to see some continued improvement in NIMs going forward?
So, whether we can outgrow or not outgrow, we sure like our opportunities continuing on the deposit side, because after all we are growing net new consumer checking accounts primary by 5.6% and on small business we are growing by 5.3% or 4%.
Talking a bit about the mortgage side, when we saw rates go up, but I think a lot of Â when the volumes have held in very strong, some of that I think is the Â as the refi pipeline coming out of first quarter, but - can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the purchase market world?
I think it's going to stay in the upper part of the range until revenue moves higher, which will probably happen as a result of - or at least most meaningfully over a short period of time because of rates moving higher.
We are spending the money that we think we need to spend to run a great business today and manage risk, as well as invest in the future around things that customers want, things that we need to be a well run, resilient, compliant, risk managed, technologically savvy firm, and that gets us to 58 plus or minus percent, which I would remind you is a very good number for a bank of our size.
We've had a benefit in the past and this time we had a negative and it was driven by a few things, but mostly by the major movements in longer-term swap rates in dollar, Sterling and LIBOR during the quarter.
All of those things are opportunities for us to make the business even stronger and more relevant going forward on top of what we feel is very good performance over the last few years.
And as you know, in our trading business, we have what you are thinking of which is market-making and customer accommodation activity but we also have the impact of our own deferred comp program, et cetera, which makes that line a little bit noisy.
Well, it's going to depend on what happens with deposits versus loan and other earning asset growth primarily.
So, when we use the term duration, we are using it in that context, but not to define a duration of the balance sheet, but really to think about using those tools, the investment portfolio and loan portfolios to impact our overall asset or liability sensitivity.
But as you suggest, itÂs regardless of what's happening with short-term rates and over what period of time that normalization of policy occurs, it's our expectation that the longer-end of the curve, that we are going to be lower for longer than we would have thought six months ago, a year ago, or a couple of years ago and how we are managing the balance sheet is a reflection of that.
Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings; including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.
Let me highlight our growth this quarter compared with one year ago.
Our deposit franchise continue to generate strong customer and balance growth with average deposits up $83.8 billion or 8% while we reduced deposit costs.
WeÂve reduced our common shares outstanding for five consecutive quarters with shares down 105 million from one year ago.
The labor market continued to recover with a record 57 consecutive months of payroll gains and housing activity has been especially encouraging with second quarter position to be the best quarter performance sales since 2007.
John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer will now provide more details on our second quarter results.
Short-term investments and FED funds sold were down $59.1 billion from the first quarter reflecting loan growth, security purchases and lower deposit balances driven by seasonality in our consumer businesses and repricing in certain wholesale businesses.
The decline in ending balances reflected the seasonal impact to consumer balances due to income tax payments and repricing in certain wholesale businesses primarily global financial institutions.
Page 9 highlights our revenue diversification in the balance between spread and fee income which has shifted slightly to more net-interest income as we benefited from strong earning asset growth.
Higher variable income from increased loan fees, semi-annual preferred dividends and PCR recoveries contributed 1 basis point to the margin, customer-driven deposit growth reduced the margin by 3 basis points but had minimal impact to net interest income.
Average loans grew 12% from a year ago with broad based growth across most wholesale businesses.
Average core deposits grew 14% from a year ago and flat linked quarter reflecting pricing actions we took in the second quarter to reduce deposit costs.
Turning to Page 17, our capital levels remains strong with our estimated common equity tier-1 ratio under Basel-3 fully phased in at 10.5% in the second quarter.
Our common shares outstanding declined by 17.7 million shares in the second quarter reflecting 36.3 million shares repurchased and 18.6 million shares issued.
While the current interest rate environment remains uncertain, we are actively managing our expenses while focusing on meeting our customersÂ financial needs to generate growth.

wellsfargo,q3,2015,"Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions.
We earned $5.8 billion in the third quarter, as our diversified business model generated growth in revenue, loans, deposits and net income compared with a year ago.
Our core loan portfolio increased by $73.4 billion, or 9% from a year ago reflecting both strong organic growth and the benefit of the acquisitions we have completed over the past year.
Increasing the number of household reserve, adding commercial relationships, deepening consumer and commercial relationships and growing loans and deposits, this focus will benefit our long term growth while we continue to meet our customers financial needs and navigate the challenges of todayÂs economy.
On page three, we showed the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted including revenue, pre-tax, pre provision profit, loans, deposits, net income and EPS and we reduced our common shares outstanding by 106.5 million shares over the past year.
We grew total assets by 7% from a year ago and 2% from second quarter with growth in loans, short term investments and investment securities.
Turning to the income statement overview on page five, revenue increased $557 million from the second quarter with growth in net interest and non-interest income and we generated positive operating leverage as expenses declined.
Our core loan portfolio grew by $73.4 billion or 9% from a year ago and was up $17.1 billion from the second quarter.
C&I loans were up $38 billion or 15% from a year ago, the growth was diversified across our wholesale businesses with double digit year-over-year growth and asset backed finance, corporate banking, commercial real estate, structured real estate and government and institutional banking.
Commercial real estate loans grew $12.8 billion or 10% from a year ago and included the second quarter of GE Capital transaction and organic growth.
Credit card balances were up $4 billion or 14% from a year ago benefitting from strong new account growth, more active accounts and the DillardÂs portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2014.
We had record new originations in the third quarter up 10% from a year ago reflecting the strong auto market while we have remained disciplined in our approach.
We grew net interest income $516 million or 5% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in loans and securities and by adding duration to the balance sheet.
The $187 million increase in net interest income from the second quarter reflected growth in investments and loans including the benefit from the GE Capital loan purchase and financing transaction related to commercial real estate assets that settled late in the second quarter.
As a result, weÂve been adding duration to our balance sheet, however our balance sheet remains asset sensitive and we are positioned to benefit from higher rates and we expect to be able to grow net interest income over the long term even if the rate environment continues to be challenging.
Total non-interest income increased $370 million from second quarter, driven by higher equity gains, other income, deposit service charges and card fees.
Non-controlling interest reduced the impact of the equity gains through our net income and increased $120 million from the second quarter.
Origination volume of $55 billion was down 11% from the second quarter reflecting the expected seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, but was up 15% from a year ago benefitting from a stronger housing market.
We are focussed on managing expenses, partially reflected in the 27% reduction in travel and entertainment expense from a year ago as we reduced non-customer facing travel, however we expect to operate at the higher end of our target efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2015 and until our revenue benefits from higher rates we expect to remain at the upper end of that range.
Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.7 billion in the third quarter, up 7% from a year ago and up 10% from second quarter.
Despite a challenging equity market environment, wealth and investment management earned $606 million in the third quarter up 10% from a year ago and up 3% from the second quarter.
These results reflect a strong balance sheet growth and net interest income growing 18% from a year ago.
Retail brokerage and managed account assets were flat from a year ago and down 6% from second quarter, the length quarter declined reflected the weak equity markets.
In summary, our third quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong growth in loans and deposits and revenue growth reflecting higher net interest and higher non-interest income.
This agreement provides us with a unique opportunity to add relationships and earning assets in businesses where GE Capital was an unequivocal market leader and where we either have meaningful experience or in the case of commercial distribution finance is a strong compliment to our existing capabilities.
Similar to the GE Capital transaction related to commercial real estate assets that closed in the second quarter, the loans releases roughly 90% based in U.S. and Canada will be recorded a fair value inclusive of a life time credit loss at close, including transition cost related to integrating these businesses we expect this acquisition to be neutral to modestly accretive to our 2016 results.
Just to summarize the timing related to our GE transactions, our results this quarter include the impact from the GE Capital transaction related to commercial real estate assets that closed in the second quarter and we expect to close in the first quarter of 2016 the GE railcar transaction and the GE Capital transactions we announced yesterday.
So with respect to the first part of your question, Joe the businesses line up well as we said the commercial distribution finance business is an asset based lending business that operates between OEMs on the one hand and the distributors on the other.
We're going to be adding these incremental assets that we talked about in connection with the GE portfolio, some of which are leases, so you think of them as a little bit longer term and fixed rate which will have the same impact as adding securities.
Just to put an emphasizes on that Mike, expenses get a lot of discussion around here and we are keenly focus on them, because as John mentioned he saved Â and we think of it in ways of what will the customer pay for and what makes us a stronger long term provider of services to our customers and to be a more relevant company to all our constituents.
And as John mentioned depending on the macro environment not all that shows up in that value creation the next quarter, but over the long period or even the interim period that is Â the best way we think to successfully grow and add to the things that are customers and our shareholders value.
We've been saying for a few quarters that what's going to happened, subsequently it's going to reflect loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic outcomes.
But it should, if we grow our portfolio and the new assets look like the assets that we already have that we'll begin providing for those which could become more of net outcome as we're already had a generational low in terms of charge-offs which means that credit performance can't really improve meaningful from where we are today.
I don't think if it is a reversal, but every quarter our employee benefit expense on the one hand and our trading results on the other hand reflect the outcomes from our deferred comp approach.
John, when you did the initial GE portfolio acquisition I guess that was couple of quarters ago, you said that you were going to continue to look at assets at GE and obviously you did.
Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth with total deposits reaching a record $1.2 trillion up $71.6 billion or 6% from a year ago and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.8%.
Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs of only 31 basis points of average loans and we operated within our targeted ranges for ROA, ROE, efficiency and net payout ratio.
Core 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $15.3 billion or 7% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality non-conforming mortgages.
We continued to successfully grow our primary consumer checking customers which were up 5.8% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers increased 5%.
Our total market sensitive revenue which includes trading and gains from debt and equity investments increased $210 million from second quarter but was down slightly from a year ago.
Lower income from variable sources also reduced the margin by 3 basis points, these decreases were partially offset by balance sheet growth and repricing driven by security purchases and higher loan balances which benefited the margin by 5 basis points.
Operating losses were stable from the second quarter but they remained higher than the five quarter average as we continued to have elevated litigation accruals for various legal matters.
We are growing our credit and debit card businesses through new customer growth and increased usage among existing customers.
Loan growth was driven by an increase in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans and security based lending.
The length quarter decline was driven by lower non-interest income primarily as a result of lower equity investment gains and reduced sales in trading and investment banking activity reflecting market volatility.
This growth benefited from the GE Capital loan purchase related to commercial real estate assets that closed last quarter and also reflected broad based growth across most wholesale businesses.
Treasury management revenue continued to grow up 9% from a year ago driven by new sales of treasury management solutions.
Our net charge-off rate was 31 basis points of average loans, up slightly from second quarter primarily from seasonally higher auto losses.
Future allowance levels whether they are higher or lower will be driven by a variety of factors including loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions.
As John mentioned earlier, operating from a position of strength allows us to make quality acquisitions that help us serve more markets and meet more of our customerÂs financial needs.
This transaction involves 77,000 railcars and just over 1000 locomotives as well as associated operating at long term leases that will be added to our existing First Union Rail business, making us the second largest railcar and locomotive leasing company in North America.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.
But any color on maybe what's a good run rate there or just maybe market sensitive revenues overall, recognizing they were down a couple hundred million this quarter?
Yes. We've talked about our real estate strategy we where shrunk by 20 million square feet over the last few years and still have more to go.
Hi. Obviously it seems like the biggest contributor as a revenue driver is asset growth stemming in part from these acquisitions, but given sort of NIM commentary and the efficiency ratio commentary, should we expect positive operating leverage into next year or more basically zero?
So it sounds like than its basically top line led operating leverage stemming in part from continued shift in mix of revenue sources, is that fair?
My second question would be whether the integration of this latest large business from GE is basically going to preclude you from looking at other possible asset portfolios et cetera at other companies due to the funding issues?
[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
",35.65,0.6796418
wellsfargo,q4,2015,"Our contribution to the real economy in 2015 was broad-based and included originating $213 billion in residential mortgage loans, $31 billion of auto loans, almost in $19 billion in new loan commitments to our small business customers who primarily have less than $20 million in annual revenue, $34 billion of middle market loans and $29 billion of commercial real estate loans.
Our financial strength and competitive position have enabled us to capture opportunities for loan growth organically and through acquisitions, with average loans up $51 billion from a year ago, a 6% increase.
Our deposit franchise once again, generated strong customer and balance growth with average deposits up $80 billion or 7% from a year ago and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.6%.
Our credit results continued to be very strong, with our net charge-off rate declining to 33 basis points for the year.
Finally, the building blocks of our long term growth, increasing our customer base, deepening relationships and growing loans and deposits continue to be the foundation of our success.
While our fourth quarter earnings were the same as a year ago, the fourth quarter of 2014 had the benefit of a credit reserve release and the gain from the sale of our government guaranteed student loan portfolio, our results this quarter demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business drivers.
Compared with a year ago, we continued to have strong loan and deposit growth throughout our diversified commercial and consumer businesses.
Credit quality remained strong, with net charge-offs of 36 basis points of average loans and we continued to have strong liquidity and capital levels.
On page 3, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including growing revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans, deposits and earnings per share.
Turning to the income statement overview on page 5, revenue declined $289 million from third quarter, as growth in net interest income was offset by lower non-interest income primarily due to the higher level of equity investment gains in the third quarter.
As shown on page 6, we had continued strong broad-based loan growth in the fourth quarter.
Our core loan portfolio grew by $62.8 billion or 8% from a year ago and was up $15.4 billion from the third quarter.
As highlighted on page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $67 billion or 6% from a year ago.
We demonstrated our ability to grow net interest income which was up 4% from a year ago through balance sheet growth, even in the challenging rate environment during 2015.
On a full-year basis, we believe we can increase net interest income in 2016 compared with 2015, in part due to the December rate increase and also from anticipated balance sheet growth.
We had linked quarter growth in a number of our businesses including investment banking, card fees, commercial real estate brokerage and mortgage banking.
Origination volume of $47 billion was down 15% from third quarter, reflecting the expected seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, but was up 7% from a year ago benefiting from a stronger housing market.
Turning to our business segments, starting on page 13, community banking earned $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 1% from a year ago and down 7% from third quarter.
Wholesale banking earned $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, stable from a year ago and up 9% from third quarter.
Revenue also benefited from continued balance sheet growth, with average loans up 13% from a year ago, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth.
Revenue reflected strong balance sheet growth, with net interest income up 15% from a year ago.
Net charge-offs increased $128 million from third quarter, reflecting $90 million of higher losses in our oil and gas portfolio which totaled $118 million in the fourth quarter and seasonally higher consumer losses.
The performance of our consumer real estate portfolios which are 36% of our loans outstanding continue to benefit from the improving housing market.
We didn't have a reserve release or build in the fourth quarter, as the improvement in our residential real estate portfolios was offset by higher commercial reserves, reflecting the impact from our oil and gas portfolio.
However, as we've mentioned in the past, it takes time for losses to emerge and at current price levels, we would expect to have a higher oil and gas losses in 2016.
In summary, our fourth quarter and full-year results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model, with strong growth in loans and deposits and consistent earnings.
So if that continues to be true, that's probably a continued tailwind, in terms of some of the drivers of the estimation of embedded loss on the consumer real estate side of the loan portfolio.
And so, the rate of change of how loans actually move to loss, reflects a lot of things and it's not just price.
But it's going to be a function of organic loan growth, closing on our GE portfolios that we've been talking about and then the number of hikes that come and when they come.
And having said all that, what we're really focused on is growing dollars of net interest income and the balance sheet structural issues, as we have rapid deposit growth or funding activity, etcetera, have an impact on the margin, but it's about dollars for us.
We'll probably focus more on that and the other targets that we give you in our May Investor Day. There's a little bit of time between now and then to really set the course for the next couple of years, that reflect the environment, that reflect the balance sheet structure that we have, that reflect our expense profile.
But I still feel like it's appropriate to think about the higher end of the range, so the 57% to 59% for this year, unless it rates really, really begin to move which seems hard to imagine sitting here at this moment.
I'm wondering, did you get enough color back from your regulators, in terms of how oil and gas losses were stressed in the 2015 CCAR and how that level is comparing to the base case right now that's embedded in your reserve?
I mean, it's made a little bit more complicated by what's going on -- in these couple of weeks, in terms of just with respect to the impact of asset-based fund or fee type arrangements.
I think it's David's expectation to continue to grow the business by adding new customers, to encourage customers to stay invested, if that's appropriate for where they are in their investing life cycle, to use these as entry points for people who have more money to put to work and longer term goals.
But I think what we're talking about in revenue terms, even with the type of pullback that we've had in the first quarter is call it, hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of net income sensitivity, if we weren't to recover from here and if we didn't have meaningful new customer -- new client growth over the course of the year, so.
And what's just your expectation, if it's different than just kind of the MBA, Fannie, Freddie for what you think the mortgage market does in the year ahead?
In terms of servicing retrenching, it's -- we'll get to a more normalized level of defaulted loan workout activity over the course of the next couple of years, as that -- the full crisis era inventory works it's way off.
We think of it more as more of a purchase market as we go forward, especially if rates increase, although they're going the other way right now.
So I wonder if you could comment, like when you just talk to that kind of industrial component of your customer base, who maybe is a more exposed to cutbacks by the energy industry and the strong dollar, do you think it's possible we actually are in an industrial recession right now?
But I think more broadly, at least as it reveals itself in our own customer activity, people who are more reliant on exports have been -- were hit early and hit hard by how strong the dollar has become over the course of the last couple of years.
But you've seen the growth in our commercial loan portfolios which reflects people doing business.
I think we've got 4 basis points of loss, something like that coming through that portfolio.
Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.
While falling energy prices have hurt certain sectors of the U.S. economy, most consumers and many businesses are benefiting from lower power costs which results in more discretionary cash that can be used for other purposes.
The housing market also continued its steady improvement, with price appreciation of 6% helping homeowners build equity and improving the credit quality of our consumer real estate portfolio where net charge-offs were down 44% from a year ago.
I am excited about opportunities to continue to build on these growth drivers in the year ahead, as our team members remain focused on satisfying all of our customer's financial needs.
Turning to page 4, we grew earning assets 3% from third quarter with loans, short term investments and investment securities all increasing.
The debt we issued during the quarter had a weighted average maturity of about eight years, at a cost of approximately three-month LIBOR plus 70 basis points.
Core 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $15.9 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality nonconforming mortgage loans.
Commercial real estate loans grew $13.6 billion or 10% from a year ago and included the second quarter GE Capital acquisition in organic growth.
Credit card balances were up $2.9 billion or 9% from a year ago, benefiting from new account growth and strong growth in active accounts as we experienced better activation rates on new accounts and more active users among our existing customers.
This relationship focus has resulted in strong primary customer growth, with the primary consumer checking customers up 5.6% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers up 4.8% Primary customers are over twice as profitable as non-primary customers.
Over the past year as we benefited from balance sheet growth, we've been able to grow net interest income by 4% while noninterest income has been relatively stable compared with a year ago.
The $131 million increase in net interest income from third quarter reflected growth in earning assets and higher income from variable sources including periodic dividends, loan recoveries and fees.
These benefits were partially offset by reduced income from seasonally lower balances of mortgages held-for-sale and increased interest expense from higher debt balances.
Income from variable sources improved the margin by 2 basis points, but was offset by customer-driven deposit growth which reduce the margin by 3 basis points, with a minimal impact on net interest income.
All other repricing growth and mix reduced the margin by another 3 basis points, driven largely by increased debt balances including the funding related to the GE Capital transactions that I mentioned earlier on the call.
The volatile markets we've had so far this year could also impact our results in capital markets related businesses, including investment banking and trading and may also affect the asset-based valuations and transaction volumes in our market-driven businesses including retail, brokerage, asset management and trust.
Other income declined $214 million from third quarter, driven by the impact of higher period end interest rates on our debt hedging results and the sale of Warranty Solutions last quarter which benefited third quarter income.
Operating losses were down $191 million from third quarter from lower litigation accruals, while foreclosed asset expense declined $89 million due to commercial real estate recoveries.
We continue to grow the number of retail bank households we serve and we're focused on building lifelong relationships with our customers by providing them with exceptional customer service.
The increase in fee income was driven by investment banking and gains from the sale of equity fund investments driven by Volker, as well as commercial real estate related businesses such as Eastdil Secured, our commercial real estate brokerage and advisory business, Multifamily Capital and structured real estate.
Retail brokerage managed account assets were up 3% from third quarter and down 1% from a year ago.
The decline from a year ago reflected lower market valuations which were partially offset by positive flows.
We continue to work closely with our customers and are monitoring market conditions and we have reset borrowing base determinations twice since energy prices started to decline in late 2014.

And while I'm sure it'll change a little bit over time, it's not going to behave like balance sheet first mortgage loans did pre-crisis, because there was just a different appetite for the types of loans that banks might hold.

wellsfargo,q1,2016,"Thank you, Jim. While the persistent low rate environment, market volatility and continued weakness in the oil and gas industry provided some near term headwinds, our long-term results continued to be driven by our focus on the real economy.
While deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove a $200 million reserve build, the rest of our loan portfolio continued to have strong credit results with our total net charge-off rate remaining near historical lows at 38 basis points annualized, reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio.
For example, while low energy prices have negatively impacted the oil and gas industry, the U.S. is still a net energy importer and the benefits of falling prices have outweighed the costs for consumers and most businesses.
So while the start of 2016 has shown that the economic recovery remains slow and uneven, we remain focused on the long term drivers of our success, namely: increasing customers, loans, deposits and building capital.
We have now generated quarterly earnings of more than $5 billion for 14 consecutive quarters, one of only two companies in the country to do so, demonstrating the strength of our diversified business model and our consistent risk discipline.
The deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove the $200 million credit reserve build in the quarter also.
On Page 4, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including increases in revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans and deposits.
Revenue increased $609 million from the fourth quarter with growth in both net interest and non-interest income.
As shown on Page 7, we had continued strong loan growth in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and 3% from the fourth quarter.
Commercial loans grew $31.6 billion from the fourth quarter, including $24.9 billion from the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth.
We grew net interest income $79 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in earning assets, including the partial quarter impact from the assets acquired from GE Capital, the benefit from higher short-term rates and disciplined deposit pricing.
We grew net interest income in the first quarter by 6% from a year ago and continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full-year basis in 2016 compared with 2015 even if there are no additional rate increases.
The non-interest income also benefited from the increase in lease income related to the GE Capital acquisitions we completed in the quarter, which also included related lease depreciation expense.
As I highlighted at the start of the call, the increase was primarily driven by $752 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter.
Net charge-offs increased $55 million from the fourth quarter, including an increase of $87 million from our oil and gas portfolio.
While our oil and gas portfolio remains under stress due to low prices and excess leverage in the industry, the rest of our loan portfolios have performed well.
Non-performing assets increased $706 million from the fourth quarter, we had $1.1 billion in higher oil and gas non-accruals and $343 million in nonaccrual loan from the GE Capital acquisitions which was within our acquisition underwriting assumptions.
Since first quarter 2015 we have released $1.8 billion of allowance that was allocated to our residential real estate portfolios while providing $1.4 billion of additional allowance allocated to our oil and gas portfolio, demonstrating the advantage of our diversified loan portfolio.
We had $17.8 billion of oil and gas loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, up $474 million from the fourth quarter, including $236 million in loans acquired from GE Capital.
Reflecting the downward credit migration, our allocated allowance for the oil and gas portfolio increased $504 million to $1.7 billion.
In summary, we are actively monitoring the impact from the disruption in the oil and gas industry in all areas of our business and we're working closely with all impacted customers.
While the level of losses we have in our oil and gas portfolio will continue to be impacted by the volatility and stress in the industry and it will take time to move through this part of the cycle, the experience of managing through many cycles will continue to be beneficial to our overall performance.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model as we continued to produce strong financial results in an environment that included some near-term headwinds.
Now weÂre analyzing the reserve every quarter and to the extent that there's continued improvement in consumer real estate in particular, itÂs certainly possible that that produces incremental benefit that absorbs some of what's happening on the oil and gas side, that's been true for a while and it may continue to be true for a while.
But I'd be hesitant to tell you that this was the big quarter, or this was the quarter, things will unfold as they're going to unfold depending on what happens with what prices, both spot and forward and the pace of restructurings of services and E&P companies.
A lot of clients, a lot of questions that I have been getting is that yeah, energy, a lot of people might be reserved good for energy, but the second or third derivative of energy was a lot of the growth of this economy over the last year or two, and since energy is starting to struggle, that the economy's got in a recession, I know you've heard of it.
There are obvious pockets of strength around the country but when you move out of oil and gas, we're in the same low growth, better consumer, strong employment environment that we've been operating in for a couple of years, not enough to make it feel like rates are going to move as a result of it but not enough to feel like we're stalling either.
We're going to have to put some of it to work, weÂre very cautious about what it means entering at these levels in terms of capital impact in the future, if a subsequent rate rise does occur that's obviously a big issue for us.
Well, weÂve Â I think we've been pretty public with the fact that we're going to hold our ground with respect to what we think our quality loan terms and borrower profile, and we've actually seen our share slip a little bit as the overall size of the auto finance market has kept pace with the sale of autos, new cars in particular that has been at a record level now for a few years.
Some of the things that feel a little bit different right now, I mean seasonally obviously we're in a better place in Q1 than Q4 just because those loans behave that way, collections and losses are lower in the first quarter than they are in the fourth quarter.
Where we've always had our eye on the elevated level of used car auction prices, the Manheim Index in particular is evidence that we point to get a sense for whether loss given default is going to be worse in the future than it is today or in the recent past and that index has been down I think 3% linked quarter, 2% year over year.
We've allowed our market leading position to slip a little bit, let other people buy the loans that don't make sense for us, itÂs still a great business for us and has been for a long time.
I guess the other question was just, wondering if you could talk a bit more about the Â how the GE Capital business integrations are going and how are you feeling currently about the potential for cross selling or revenue synergies.
So I think you mentioned 25% of your loans went through the redeterminations process in the quarter; is that right?
But it's the tradeoff between foregone earnings, capital sensitivity and a handful of other things that we're having to assess and we're doing it with our best estimate of where we think rates are going and what happens if they don't go there.
And so the long and the short of it is I don't think that we're going to continue to build cash balances like we did in the first quarter.
John, lastly trying to climb into your head a little bit, as you were looking at the first quarter and you had the gain from selling the crop insurance business and rates were going down and you had so much market disruption, were you kind of thinking, since I have this gain over here, I don't really feel comfortable putting my liquidity to work because of whatÂs going on in the market.
We continued to grow our customer base both organically and through acquisitions and February was the strongest month for retail bank household growth in five years.
Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth with average deposits up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5%.
This improvement has continued to benefit our consumer real estate portfolio where net charge-offs were down 41% from a year ago.
Commercial real estate also remained strong with vacancy rates low in apartment, industrial and retail sectors and our CRE portfolio continued to generate net recoveries.
While earnings declined from a year ago, our results in the first quarter last year included a discrete tax benefit of $359 million or $0.07 per share and a $100 million dollar reserve release.
Our revenue benefited from the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business resulting in a $381 million gain recorded in all other non-interest income.
All other income also included $379 million of hedge ineffectiveness primarily on our own long-term debt hedges reflecting the impact of lower rates and foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter.
Short-term investments and Fed funds sold increased $30.4 billion reflecting growth in deposits, long term debt and our disciplined approach in managing liquidity and investment securities during the quarter.
Consumer loans declined $923 million from the fourth quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto and securities-based lending and student lending was more than offset by reductions in junior lien mortgage and seasonal declines in credit card.
Our total average loan yield increased 8 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the GE Capital acquisitions as well as the benefit of floating rate loan repricing.
The benefit of our strong balance sheet and industry expertise enabled us to add these high quality businesses, including talented new team members and valuable customer relationships.
We completed the GE Railcar Services acquisition on January 1, which included $918 million of loans and interest earning leases and $3.2 billion of operating leases reported in other assets.
C&I loans were up $50.5 billion or 19% from a year ago driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth.
Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $17.3 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans.
Commercial real estate loans grew $15.8 billion or 12% from a year ago, benefiting from the second quarter GE Capital acquisition and organic growth.
Credit card balances were up $3.1 billion or 10% from a year ago, reflecting new accounts and increases in active accounts.
These increases were partially offset by reduced income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and loan fees and one less day in the quarter.
While linked-quarter trends in deposit service charges and card fees were negatively impacted by seasonality, both of these fees grew 8% from a year ago driven by account growth.
Origination volume was $44 billion, down 6% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality but purchase originations were up 13% from a year ago, reflecting a stronger housing market.
Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability declined $107 million from fourth quarter, which also contributed to lower production revenue.
Servicing income increased $120 million from fourth quarter, from higher net MSR servicing hedge results and lower unreimbursed servicing costs.
We continued to successfully grow retail bank households and increased our primary consumer checking customers which were up 5% from a year ago.
Investment banking declined on overall market weakness and some of our commercial real estate related businesses had weaker results coming off a very strong fourth quarter performance.
Average deposit balances declined $3.7 billion from a year ago, reflecting lower international deposits from market volatility and the competitive rate environment.
The year-over-year results reflect a strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up 14% offset by the impact of weak equity market conditions on fee income.
Balance sheet growth remained strong with average deposits up 8% from a year ago and loans up 13%, the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth with continued growth in non-conforming mortgage loans and securities based lending.
Credit results continued to benefit from our diversified portfolio with only 38 basis points of annualized net charge-offs.
As I mentioned earlier, we had a $200 million reserve build during the quarter as continued improvements in our residential real estate portfolio were more than offset by higher oil and gas reserves.
Our total oil and gas loan exposure which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding was down $1.3 billion or 3% from the fourth quarter with declines across all three sectors.
Our consistent focus on executing on our vision continued to benefit our fundamental drivers of long term growth, including adding customers, loans and deposits while maintaining our strong capital position.
That's part one, and then part two is in terms of broader M&A, because of your size and favored nation status you're the kind of preferred name for news reporters and others that speculate on M&A for big financial companies, and since a lot's changed around the environment the last few years, can you just remind us your strategy around M&A, maybe how it's different than when you were smaller and how Dodd-Frank and Too Big To Fail might affect your view on acquisitions going forward?

wellsfargo,q2,2016,"Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions.
Our diversified business model and continued focus on meeting our customer's financial needs drove our performance in the second quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion.
We produced strong performance during a period that has had - has included persistent low rates, market volatility and economic volatility, and we did it by focusing on the core building blocks of long-term shareholder value creation, that is growing relationships, loans, investments and deposits.
However, compared to our large bank peers, it should have a much lower direct impact on our long-term business drivers because as you know we are largely a US centric company and many indicators point to continued relative strength in the US economy.
Compared with the first quarter, we had strong loan and deposit growth, we increased net interest income by growing earning assets.
While our earnings were down $161 million from a year ago, our results in the second quarter last year included a $350 million reserve release while this quarter we had a $150 million reserve build primarily due to loan growth in commercial, auto and the credit card portfolios.
With the expectation of rates remaining lower-for-longer, we grew our investment securities portfolio by $18.5 billion, with $38 billion of gross purchases in the second quarter significantly higher than the $5 billion repurchases last quarter and higher than the $26 billion of average quarterly purchases last year.
As we highlighted at Investor Day we expect that we will need to increase our portfolio of qualifying TLAC by approximately $50 billion in order to be compliant including a 100 basis point buffer which we plan to complete through measured issuance over the phase-in period of approximately five years.
We grew net interest income $66 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by long growth including the full quarter benefit of the assets acquired from GE Capital.
The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the first quarter primarily due to growth in long-term debt and deposits and reduced income from investment securities.
We grew net interest income in the second quarter by 4% from a year ago even with 11 basis point reduction in NIM.
While total non-interest income decreased $99 million from the first quarter, we had growth in many areas that reflect our focus on key business drivers including increases in service charges on deposit accounts, brokerage fees, trust and investment management, investment banking, card fees, gains on mortgage loan originations, trading gains on higher customer accommodation activity, and lease income reflecting the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition.
Total mortgage banking revenue which includes both the gain on the sale from originations and servicing income declined $184 million from the first quarter.
Since Brexit and the related decrease in mortgage rates, weÂve seen refinance activity increase with our retail application volumes up approximately 15% to 20% in recent weeks and we currently expect origination volume to be somewhat higher in the third quarter compared with the second quarter.
The decline also reflected the gain from the sale of the crop insurance business recognized last quarter and the gain on the sale of our health benefits services business in the second quarter with a net impact from these sales of $91 million lower other income compared with the first quarter.
This line highlights just a few examples that weÂve recently announced, weÂre working on additional products and services within our innovation group that are scheduled to be released over the coming quarters that we believe will add tangible long-term value for our customers and shareholders.
Turning to our business segment starting on page 14; community banking earned $3.2 billion in the second quarter, down 1% from a year ago and 4% from the first quarter.
Average deposit balances declined $6.6 billion from a year ago, driven by lower international deposits from market volatility and our pricing discipline in the competitive rate environment.
Net charge offs increased $38 million from the first quarter including an increase of $59 million from our oil and gas portfolio which was partially offset by $46 million of lower consumer real estate losses.
As I mentioned earlier, we had $150 million reserve build during the quarter primarily related to long growth in the commercial, auto and credit card portfolios.
Overall the performance of our oil and gas portfolio in the second quarter was consistent with our expectations and our experience of managing through many cycles will continue to benefit us and our customers as we move through the remainder of the cycle.
The headwinds from a flatter yield curve and a lower-for-longer rate environment creates challenges for all financial institutions but we will continue to focus on what we can control earning lifelong relationships with our customers which drive our long-term growth opportunities.
Is it continued balance sheet growth, is it even more disciplined expense management, is it growth and fees in businesses where you don't have scale yet, just trying to figure out, Wells always have as a reputation for pulling on levers to support EPS growth and I'm wondering as we look out over the next 12 months what you think are the most impactful ones are?
I think it's all of the above Erika, you mentioned in broad terms the likeliest sources, if rates are going to remain lower, we will work hard at earning asset growth.
Let me just drill down a little bit on the expense side Erika, we operate within our 55% to 59% range on the efficiency ratio, which is, you know that's either at close to or at the top of our industry surely for our large bank peers, weÂve spend a lot of money in the last couple of years around things like compliance and risk management and so forth.
John also mentioned that we continue to look to simplify our business to get more standard and frankly a lot of the investments weÂre making on customer service and consumer convenience has a front-end cost component but a back end benefit.
So it's a good question, and the things that we're balancing are - and readjusting constantly are expectation for what rates are going to do next and whether today is a better or worse entry point then waiting a quarter or waiting longer.
So it's a delicate balance going on all the time, but I would say that weÂre relatively convinced that we may not be this low forever but like we said a year ago our expectation is lower-for-longer at the curve and we're going to keep putting money to work.
WeÂre looking at the total output every quarter we got a laundry list of things that might be seasonal that might be episodic, it could be gains from securities portfolio, weÂve been selling a handful of non-core businesses and some of them have given rise to gains.
But my laundry list is what you guys see back which are market sensitive items that you often call out as unreliably different from quarter to quarter, some of the mortgage activity which can be a little bit more episodic, mortgage hedging activity, this is what some analysts refer to as things that they have a hard time modeling, I mentioned gains on the sale of debt or equity securities.
I look at the last seven, eight years here since our merger our Wachovia, the time of the merger we had something less than $800 billion of deposits, now we are over $1.2 trillion, we've grown deposits even after run-off of those high-priced CDs by $400 billion or $500 billion, weÂre up maybe $100 billion on loans during that period of time, so deposits are far outstripped loans in fact, if you believe lower-for-longer there is going to be a hunger for earning assets.
And while our quarter two might look different recently, if we look at, in our last year, the growth of $51 billion of deposits versus $80 billion of loans if you strip out some of the loans that we purchased, if you look on organic basis weÂre still growing deposits faster.
How do you think about the appropriate level of reserve coverage in auto and card, and do you think the current environment is supportive of a path where charge offs and reserves in those businesses can grow on-line with loans such that the consumer credit provision is not a headwind to your earnings growth.
As we mentioned, we added a little bit to our allowance this quarter and in part it was from consumer credit but that's based on the growth in the portfolio not because of any meaningful change in underlying behavior.
Now we've said earlier that we are happy to provide more reserve more allowance when weÂre growing our loan portfolio thatÂs because it was going to happen as we came out of the period of releases and are moving into a period of net provisioning and growth.
As Bill asked, I don't know if that makes it a real headwind, I think that means the expected case is probably a little bit lower ROI than the existing case for most people who have been benefiting from the best of times in credit but not so meaningfully that it causes us to want to curtail growth based on the way we approach the market, as I mentioned we are happy with our auto growth, weÂve maintained our pricing and our risk discipline.
And John, the 28 basis points John just mentioned to you, there is a lot of Johns here, but for this quarter ex-oil and gas is equal to what it was a year ago.
For non-HQLA, the limitations are different because you are losing the benefit of that liquidity and we've continued to mention the ability to move out of cash or HQLA into risk assets, all things being equal, based on a snapshot as tens of billions of dollars of activity.
We actually went out and did a little bit of incremental funding in the marketplace to have that liquidity set aside and that weÂre allowing that to run off, it was relatively short-term, but it makes sense for us to have ready access to something, some, call it, $200 billion worth of instant liquidity at any point in time.
So itÂs still our plan and our goal and what weÂre telling you is that we intend to grow net interest income, even if there are no rate moves and we're doing it by adding -- by redeploying cash into HQLA and other earning assets, by looking everywhere for customers where we can make quality loans and those are the big items.
And John, the biggest influence that Brexit had on our company was not on, frankly, a direct impact on the way we do business or customer strengthen like that, it really was the big move down in long-term rates.
In regards to your servicing results within the mortgage bank, were there any changes in the way youÂve hedged that asset this quarter or was there something just specific around the rate curve and the movement in the yield curve in the second quarter versus the first quarter that would have caused the hedging gains to be less than expected?
Well, I think we're talking about a couple of hundred million dollars of unreimbursed direct costs in the second quarter and the run rate is probably half of that, looking back over the last several quarters.
What I would point out is that weÂre amortizing premiums on mortgage securities in particular that are highly prepayment sensitive and in this quarter, the net interest margin or net interest dollars negative impact of getting premium book value bonds called away at par was, I think the number is $100 million.
And then on commercial real estate, I mean, I guess letÂs think about both your commentary and data as well as like what the OCC is saying, et cetera, there is just kind of general concern around underwriting standards, but at the same time, the current data around loan growth is pretty good and on charge-offs, kind of bouncing between zero and net recovery.
WeÂre the best frankly in that business and there is a lot of knock-on benefit in terms of the financing that we do, investment banking that we do for those customers, but it is cyclical and it'll follow patterns like the ones that we just talked about in terms of what's going on in different markets.
But as was mentioned earlier by Erika in terms of what might happen or what has to happen, as we grow in the future, it will be earning asset growth, loans and investments, it will be how efficient we are on the expense side of things and then the whole spectrum of non-interest income generating possibilities.
There are more assets changing here, and things are freeing up a little bit and that's going to help with resolutions and weÂve captured the benefit of that in our analysis for what our exposures are, but itÂs true and it was less true a couple of quarters ago.
Net charge offs remained near historical lows at 39 basis points annualized reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio and continued underwriting discipline.
Mary is a 32-year veteran of the financial services industry and has a diverse mix of experiences including retail banking, which will serve her well as she takes the reign of this key business.
Thank you John and good morning everyone.
My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on page 2, then John and I will answer your questions.
Period end commercial loan balances grew $6.3 billion from first quarter, remember the GE Capital acquisition only impacted average loan growth this quarter.
Consumer loans increased $3.6 billion linked quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit card and securities-based lending was partially offset by declines in junior lean mortgages and seasonally lower student lending.
Credit card balances were up $3 billion or 10% reflecting new account openings and increases in active accounts.
Our average deposit cost was 11 basis points, up 1 basis point from first quarter and 3 basis points from a year ago reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain wholesale banking customers.
Our market sensitive results in the second quarter which included strong gains from trading and debt security gains was partially offset by lower equity gains.
Production revenue increased $306 million or 41% reflecting higher originations.
Partially offsetting these declines was an increase of $186 million from outside professional services after typically lower expenses in the first quarter.
While total expenses have increased, weÂve reduced expenses in many categories even as we've grown the balance sheet by acquiring businesses and adding new customers.
We remain focused on providing outstanding customer service and achieved record store customer loyalty scores during the second quarter and the highest year-to-date retail banking household retention in four years.
P2P payments are not new to Wells Fargo with our customers conducted over $10 billion in P2P volume through our SurePay service in 2015.
Credit card purchase volume was $19.4 billion, up 10% from a year ago benefiting from 8% active account growth.
However charge offs for wholesale banking are still historically low with only 27 basis points of net charge offs annualized in the second quarter.
Turning to page 17, credit results continue to benefit from our diversified portfolio with only 39 basis points of annualized net charge offs.
Criticized loans which include non-accrual loans were down $1.7 billion or 17% from first quarter reflecting paydowns, borrowing base upgrades and net charge offs.

wellsfargo,q3,2016,"Thank you for joining our call today where our President and CEO, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions.
We have a specific action plan in place to lead our company forward during this period, which is focused on outreach to everyone who has been impacted by retail banking sales practices, including our customers, our team members, our investors, our regulators, elected officials, and the communities that we do business in.
And let me clarify that these accounts had a de minimis impact to the retail banking household cross-sell ratio that we report on a quarterly basis with the maximum impact in any one quarter of 0.02 products per household or 0.3% of the reported metric.
We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of doing what is right for our customers and the elimination of product sales goals has been positively received by both our team members and our customers.
WeÂre reaching out to all retail and small business checking, savings, credit card, and unsecured line of credit customers, and weÂre asking them to contact us if they have any concerns about their accounts or any aspect of the relationship with Wells Fargo.
For consumer credit card customers identified, over half have closed their accounts, in part reflecting the passage of time as some of these accounts were opened five years ago.
For example, if the loan was from Wells Fargo, and the customer was impacted by a lower FICO score, we will adjust the line size, modify pricing, and refund any additional costs incurred.
Our deposit customers continue to use their accounts with balances up $6.5 billion in September compared with August and debit card transactions up 9% from a year ago.
We continue to see increased usage among our customers with active cards up 9%, balances up 10%, and transaction volume also up 10% from a year ago.
Overall, we did not see any meaningful change of business trends in wholesale banking late in the quarter and deposit balances were up 4% during the month of September and loan pipelines were in line with the second quarter.
And last year, we invested $300 million in team member training in credit, risk, technology and customer service.
I want to start on page 13 with a few key takeaways from our third quarter results, which reflect the benefit of our diversified business model and the momentum across many of our businesses.
The slight decline in non-interest income was driven by a $303 million reduction in market sensitive revenue, which is at its lowest level in the past five quarters and a decrease in other income reflecting the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business last quarter.
As highlighted on page 19, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the third quarter, up $62.6 billion or 5% from a year ago and included 8% growth in consumer and small business banking deposits.
The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by growth in long-term debt and deposits, partially offset by the benefit of earning asset growth.
Non-interest income declined $53 million from the second quarter, which included a $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business and declined $42 million from a year ago, which included $780 million of higher gains from equity investments.
Across a number of our fee businesses, we had the best results in five quarters, including deposit accounts, trust and investment, mortgage banking and lease income.
Turning to our business segments starting on page 25, community banking earned $3.2 billion in the third quarter, down 9% from a year ago and up 2% from the second quarter.
Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, up 6% from a year ago and down 1% from the second quarter.
Revenue was $7.1 billion, down 2% from the second quarter due to the gain last quarter on the sale of our health benefits services business.
Revenue benefited from record net interest income, up 4% from second quarter and 12% from a year ago.
WeÂre working closely with our customers, our regulators and our team members to move forward and make things right.
However, our board is conducting an independent investigation into our retail banking sales practices and related matters and weÂre not in a position to discuss those topics today.
First, in our retail banking business, weÂll continue our outreach efforts to our customers and focus on making things right.
And third, as youÂve heard on the call today, weÂre committed to being transparent regarding business trends and you should expect updates on these activities during the quarter.
Matt, the blurb really reflected the fact that weÂre moving approximately 2,000 of our team members that are in risk and control positions within our business lines to our corporate risk functions.
So, I guess, the broader question is, thereÂs going to be some cost impact of the sales practice issue, probably some revenue impact as well.
The bigger picture, of course, some people have asked is, what will the business model feel like in community banking with a more service oriented culture rather than a more sales oriented culture.
ItÂs our intention to to be successful in providing all of our customers with what they need in terms of financial products through a service oriented model.
And then it will work its way in over the course of the coming quarters, but itÂs a question that people have asked and itÂs one that weÂll provide a lot of transparency around, so that people can understand the impact of that change as itÂs being made.
And I guess, really what the question is, is given the uncertainty of the community bank impact on revenue and expenses going forward, are there other levers within Wells Fargo in that you can deliver that 1.1% to 1.4% ROA within the next two years and can you grow earnings without any help from macro next year despite this uncertainty?
But as John indicated, it's a little bit sooner to rate in terms of what the impact, the longer-term impact of the sales practices issues are going to be within community banking.
And, of course, now in addition to what we just talked about with Matt about compliance costs, weÂre going to have incremental operating losses as a result of this litigation etc.
And my second Â my follow-up question, part of your stockÂs appeal has always been the dividend and the overall capital return, and I'm wondering if some of the overhang from these issues from litigation, from potential DoJ investigation impact how you think about capital return going forward?
Betsy, I saw an executive with decades of experience in the financial services industry and decades of experience at Wachovia and Wells Fargo, who's been through a variety of challenges in her career and who is an incredibly effective leader and somebody who I believe in, and our entire senior leadership team and the board believe, that who can effectuate the change that is needed on our retail banking platform.
And that change, I think, I want to just reinforce is very important because what we've done is we've brought together all of the payments businesses, how so many of our customers, both retail and commercial, interact with us every day, we brought them all together.
One of the benefits that we have at Wells Fargo is that we have these diversified set of businesses, and so frequently in our list of 90 different businesses, not every one of them is necessarily material in any one quarter to the impact of the company.
But weÂre going to work hard to make things right within the company to earn that business back over time.
And then separately, the offsets that could come on the expense side to those types of items, I believe you allude to branch consolidation potential later on in your slide deck as well as the travel that you flagged on your comments, so wanted to see how we could think about the timing of that type of relief from those items.
So think about our bankers being incented to provide good service, and so weÂll be measuring that on an independent basis, to think about our bankers being focused on helping our customers do more business, but being measured on product usage and activity as opposed to individual product sales and also about an overall growth in assets and balances and also think about it being much more driven to a team approach as opposed to just on an individual basis.
And then, so a follow-up for John, on the net interest margin and net interest income, when we try to assess the impact of what a potential rate hike would do, one rate hike, itÂs hard to discern what happened after the December hike last time because the first quarter, you had a few moving parts.
I guess, a follow-up, this is a long wind-up here, but itÂs a little frustrating not getting that retention [indiscernible] the customers that were impacted the most, whatÂs been your retention rate.
And thatÂs one of the reasons why we want to accelerate the timing of our investor day because we want to provide increased transparency which weÂve done today and we want to provide a more continuous updates as to how we are operating the company.
I think, overall, in the wholesale businesses, as you said, every quarter can be a little bit different in terms of loan growth.
Having said that, like all facets of our retail banking business, weÂre going to review those.
I think credit cards it's a little bit tricky just because over the last few years weÂve seen such gross in our credit card business in terms of penetration and our usage numbers have been good.
And, again, as it relates to the deposit accounts Â and, John, jump in here if you feel differently Â weÂre so new into the impact.
And then not to Monday morning quarterback or rehash what you've done in the past, but, Tim, I really wanted to ask you, what, in this experience, has changed the way you think about the role of CEO, as you now assume it, and Wells Fargo as a company or a culture?
When I think about the retail sales practices issues weÂve had at the company, I wish that the business had escalated the issues sooner.
And I highlight that because I think that one of the lessons that I've learned Â one of the lessons the entire company has learned and one of the reasons that weÂre organized the way we are today and weÂre making many of the changes that weÂve talked about are that we've got to escalate issues wherever they occur within the company sooner.
I think I mentioned earlier, in CCAR, our own stress analysis, we concoct and imagine outsized op risk outcomes to demonstrate that weÂve got the capital and earnings power to overcome them and the magnitude of what weÂre talking about here frankly, Â while itÂs significant, is modest in comparison to what you can imagine in stress, both in our own scenario as well as in CCAR.
ItÂs the month when our team members were probably the most uncertain in terms of what the go forward model is going to be as we pivot toward service.
We want to arm our team members with the right incentives and have them work together and provide a good advice and service to our customers and make sure that weÂve got great products out there.
ItÂs absolutely appropriate to step back and think about all aspects of how we provide product and service and convenience to our customers.
I think this year, in fact, thereÂs going to be a reduction unrelated to what weÂve talked about here.
But, look, the company Â when I think about the company that I joined 29 years ago, itÂs so different today.
So, no, fair point that itÂs probably a little bit more tactical and strategic, but over time you'll see some updates and we'll talk about those over the next few months and I'm sure we'll talk about some of that at Investor day next year.
But I really want to thank all of you for your thoughtful questions, the discussion I think has been incredibly helpful for both John and me and we look forward to continuing to provide additional disclosure to you as we move through the quarter.
[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations.
This action demonstrates the dedication John has had to Wells Fargo throughout his 34 years with the company, including successfully leading us through the financial crisis and the largest merger in banking history.
Effective October 1, we eliminated product sales goals for our retail banking team members; and next year, we will introduce a new performance plan based on updated metrics around customer service, growth, and risk management.
There are a lot of reasons why customers don't activate their cards, so weÂre trying to contact all unactivated credit card customers with open accounts to confirm whether they want their credit cards.
WeÂre also focused on determining potential additional impacts that the identified consumer and small business deposit and credit card customers may have incurred.
WeÂre working on determining potential financial impact for customers who obtained a loan with Wells Fargo or another company during the 12-month period where their FICO score may have been impacted by the credit inquiry.
When analyzing these trends versus the prior month, itÂs important to remember that September had two fewer business days this year than August.
While it is too early to determine the long-term impact, and weÂre prepared for things to get worse before they get better, here's what weÂve observed so far.
The drivers of lower banker interactions also resulted in new consumer checking account openings declining 25% in September compared with openings in September a year ago.
Lower referrals, marketing and product offerings also impacted credit card applications, which were down 20% in September compared with September a year ago.
Applications were down 77,000 from a year ago compared with 7.8 million total active cards.
September closed referred investment assets Â these are the referrals resulting from the Wells community banking partnership Â were more than $1 billion, in line with prior trends.
We are also assisting former team members who left retail banking due to sales performance and who remain eligible for rehire and applying for available positions at the company.
Mary Mack, who was the new head of community banking, has met with team members in ten cities so far to gather ideas, concerns and questions from frontline retail managers at all levels to help inform the go-forward strategy for a service-driven community bank.
Many of our businesses had their best non-interest income results in five quarters, including strong mortgage banking results.
Credit quality improved including lower losses in our oil and gas portfolio and our capital position remains strong as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders.
Our average deposit cost was stable with second quarter at 11 basis points and up 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain wholesale banking customers.
As shown on page 23, expenses increased $402 million from the second quarter, driven by $243 million of higher operating losses, reflecting increased litigation accruals.
Operating losses could continue to increase related to outstanding legal matters such as sales practice issues as weÂve disclosed in our 10-K filing RMBS.
While our expenses increased this quarter, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth, which we highlight on page 24.
WeÂre also working on creating a simpler and more collaborative way to seamlessly serve customers and team members by aligning similar teams in areas like marketing, finance and operations.
This new group will bring teams from across the company together to accelerate our focus on delivering the next generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings and investing in new customer experiences and products.
This new group includes our innovation, consumer credit card, deposit products, treasury management and virtual channels teams.
WeÂre also making it easier for our customers to open accounts through mobile channels including brokerage, business direct, and personal credit products.
We've already discussed earlier on the call, many of the business trends within community banking, so I'll just briefly highlight that our customers continued to actively use our payment and digital products with debit card transaction volume up 8% from a year ago and credit card purchase dollar volume also up 8%.
Client assets across WIM reached record highs this quarter driven both by market gains and continued positive net flows.
Turning to page 28, credit results improved from second quarter with only 33 basis points of annualized net charge-offs.
Net charge-offs declined $119 million or from second quarter from lower oil and gas, credit card and consumer real estate losses, and continued commercial real estate recoveries.
Non-performing assets decreased $1.1 billion from second quarter with improvement across our consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
As Tim mentioned, weÂre going to have an off-cycle investor day next May. And if we think that those arenÂt reasonable guideposts anymore, weÂll tell people.
Hey, good morning.
Tim, I know it's early here, but maybe you could talk about what factors are you going to be balancing when you redesign the sales incentive scorecard?
Hey, good morning, guys.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.
I think we have deposits growing by $6 billion when we have new accounts not opening as quickly.
Brian, thatÂs another reason why we want to continue to provide enhanced disclosure because we want to make sure that you are comfortable with how any of the headwinds weÂre facing right now are affecting business.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
ItÂs the month when our customers and prospects are first reflecting their real dissatisfaction with Wells Fargo, all those things put together.
And Tim mentioned that weÂre going to roll this forward probably during the quarter, so people can see whether October looks like September and November looks like October and then we can start to build a projectable impact on the trend.
I think Â weÂre focused less on size because size is ultimately determined by our customers.
Having said that, weÂve looked at across the company and youÂve seen us exit some businesses that we believed would not provide us with as strong return as they might provide another owner.
Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.
Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.
I think weÂre still going to approach every client relationship with an emphasis on every client having a customized plan that guides their investment activity.

wellsfargo,q4,2016,"Our results in 2016 demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with loan and deposit balances at an all-time high while we maintained a strong risk discipline.
On Page 3 we describe the progress weÂve made on our retail banking sales practices remediation plan, including contacting our retail and small business customers and encouraging anyone who has concerns to contact us.
Customers are increasingly coming into our branches including a modest increase in banker interactions which started in the last two weeks of November and continued through year-end.
Our existing customers have continued to use their accounts and weÂve seen higher deposit and credit card balances and increased credit and debit card transaction volume which drives near-term revenue.
As weÂve previously discussed as part of our overall asset/liability management program, we typically swap our fixed rate long term debt to floating rate in order to balance our deposit oriented liability structure and better align with the interest rate sensitivity characteristics of our assets.
Deposit growth was also strong up $30.2 billion from third quarter with increases in commercial, consumer and small business banking balances and our short term borrowings declined $27.9 billion reflecting lower repurchase balances.
Non-interest income declined $1.2 billion driven by net hedging ineffectiveness, accounting losses, as well as lower trading and mortgage banking results which I will discuss later.
Consumer and small business banking deposits increased 8% from a year ago.
Net interest margin increased five basis points from the third quarter driven by growth in earning assets including deployment of cash into investments and the net benefit from higher interest rates.
Mortgage banking results decreased $250 million from third quarter and included a $163 million decline in mortgage servicing income primarily due to higher unreimbursed servicing costs.
As a result we increased our estimated cost to resolve these properties in the fourth quarter, however we expect these actions will reduce unreimbursed servicing costs significantly in 2017.
On Page 17 we highlight the five quarter trend across major fee categories, compared with a year ago many of our fee businesses grew including deposit accounts, brokerage, investment banking, card and mortgage originations.
This page illustrates that while many businesses had above average results in the fourth quarter, total non-interest income reflected below average mortgage servicing income and lower market sensitive revenue which was down $526 million from a year ago.
WeÂve been working on a number of initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion annually by year-end 2018 with the full year benefits starting in 2019.
Let me take some time to discuss our branch strategy in more detail, itÂs along with each and every business within the company as part of our focus on discretionary spending.
We will be providing more details on our branch distribution strategy at our May Investor Day. WeÂve already discussed many of the business trends within community banking, so I won't go into any more details here.
Fourth quarter results reflected strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up 14% from a year ago.
WIM total client assets reached a record high in the fourth quarter of $1.7 trillion, up 7% from a year ago driven by higher market valuations and continued positive net flows.
We once again earned more than $5 billion in the quarter demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model which continued to perform well during a period where we faced unique challenges.

Our final question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
Thank you for joining our call today where our President and CEO, Tim Sloan and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions.
In general, while account openings are still down from a year ago, customers continue to actively use their accounts and many of the trends have shown improvements from the lows earlier in the fourth quarter.
The decline in the rate of new account openings may impact the pace of future revenue growth, so weÂll continue to be transparent regarding those trends.
We had solid underlying performance in the quarter including a record level of loans and deposits and strong growth in net interest income.
It's important to note that our results in the quarter included the loss of $592 million or $0.07 a share from the impact of net hedge ineffectiveness accounting.
Consumer loans were reduced by the $3.8 billion deconsolidation of certain previously sold reverse mortgage loans following the sale of the related servicing in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 10, while revenue declined from the third quarter we had strong growth in net interest income up $450 million and our NIM increased 5 basis points.
As highlighted on Page 13, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $67.4 billion or 6% from a year ago with growth in both commercial and consumer deposits.
Net interest income was up $450 million or 4% from the third quarter reflecting growth in loans and investment securities, higher interest incomes on trading assets and higher income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and fees.
Non-interest income declined $1.2 billion from the third quarter including the $592 million of net hedge ineffectiveness accounting losses as well as lower trading and mortgage banking fees.
Net trading activities declined due to a $223 million decrease in secondary trading, reflecting lower client volumes compared with the strong third quarter as well as seasonality, fewer trading days in the fourth quarter and lower client demand as clients adapted to the rising rate environment.
As shown on Page 18 expenses declined $53 million from the third quarter, but our efficiency ratio increased to 61.2% primarily driven by the impact of net hedge ineffectiveness losses on our revenue.
Turning to our business segments starting on Page 21, community banking earned $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter down 14% from a year ago and down 15% from third quarter.
TheyÂre captured in this calculation of our rate sensitivity and so if you think about LIBOR based commercial loans as the hedged item there those wonÂt float up and that incremental benefit won't be passed along in the near term as a result of the choice to fix those out and to earn higher interest income in previous periods and to change their profile.
Things have changed clearly, and expectations have changed, but the efficiency ratio is a function of not only your expense rate, but also revenue growth and we're hopeful that we'll continue to grow revenue overtime as we did over the last year in 2016.
And our guidance is that, in the short term as revenue continues to grow and we continue to have some headwinds from an expense standpoint and the first quarter is going to be a good example of that because we'll have some impact from annual incentive compensation impact and so on, that weÂll going to be at the high end, and again we think about this expense ratio -- our efficiency ratio, excuse me, not on our quarterly basis, but as much year-over-year.
The big sources, setting mortgage aside because we talked about it a little bit in the prepared comments and I think you just nailed it, weÂre in that lower point in the refi cycle.
In our other big sources, deposit, deposit service charges, our customers are using our products more than ever, so weÂve had good growth in debit card and weÂll continue to work there and now we need to continue to attract new customers to the bank in order for that to grow like it has in the past, that is an area of focus for Mary as she launches her new program in community banking and of course a lot of that also comes from the commercial side of things where weÂre a leader in providing treasury management services to our corporate customers as well.
And then with respect to brokerage, obviously weÂre at high market levels right now so we expect good fees from that as well as institutional asset management, but with David CarrollÂs teams focus on meeting the saving for retirement and investing needs of all of our banking customers, my sense is that there continues to be an opportunity there also.
Yeah, I would just reinforce the opportunity we have in wealth and investment management, as John said David and team did a terrific job last year and when you think about growing that business 10% year-over-year and just couldnÂt be more pleased with those performance.
Because you never know where a dollar of revenue is going to come from and especially on the non-interest income side, the mix matters in terms of what itÂs related expenses are and so I wouldnÂt be predicting a couple of years forward what that mix is going to look like or what the associated expense impact is going to look like at the margins from a dollar of one sort of non-interest income versus another, I would think about it as these are undertakings that we have going on to accomplish all of our incremental spending and still stay in 55% to 59% on an annual basis.
I would just reinforce JohnÂs comment, just to think about that 55% to 59% that weÂre going to save a lot of money here at Wells Fargo, and weÂre going to reinvest that business for the long-term that will pay benefits well beyond the next couple of years.
I do think itÂs reasonable though to say to get to the lower end of the range itÂs going to be because of the impact of higher rates on interest income.
There is no question that there have been certain rules and regulations that have been promulgated over the last eight years which have impacted and provided some concern in the industry not just with big banks in terms of how we provide credit, some of it is related to the fact that we all, weÂre part of servicing settlements that went back decades almost and which were a surprise to everybody.
That the volumes has exceeded our expectations and so weÂre just really pleased with the fact that weÂve had a very strong origination year and you know the credit quality within the mortgage businesses has just continued to exceed our expectations.
So weÂre really pleased with the position that we have in the mortgage business weÂre hopeful that the new administration can continue to provide clarification in terms of that business and we look forward to working with them.
Lower turnover means lower training cost, it means a higher productivity because you've got more experienced bankers, tellers, service folks, that are working with our customers, so net-net overtime making this decision we think is a net positive for the company so we really don't look at it as gosh it's going to have this kind of an impact in a certain period of time, because the other outcomes that I mentioned aren't really known until we look back a year from now.
So our strategy is really based upon listening to customers and looking at their habits and how they want to interact with us and based upon that we think it makes sense and MaryÂs has had an opportunity to oversee the business for the last six months and what weÂve concluded is that we should increase the pace of rationalization to about 200 this year.
But, when I think about the fundamentals of the plan, they were reviewed by Mary and team, we had a lot of discussions with the retail folks, we had it reviewed by our risk folks and HR folks and the likes, and just the fundamentals of basing it on customer service, increasing in primary accounts and household growth, I mean those are all measurable items.
Recall that in 2014 we made a number of changes in terms of how we provide information to our customers, how we process payments and deposits and debits and credits and the like, which meant that our deposit or our overdraft income actually declined in 2015 to 2014 and so the year-over-year, again three quarters to three quarters comparison you're seeing '16 to '15 is a reflection of the changes we made in '14, revenue decline in '15 and then growing off that number and the reason itÂs growing is not because there's anything nefarious that we're doing or it's part of any sort of retail sales practices issue.
We think maybe our competitors are making some of the changes that we made a year later and so maybe that's impacting some of their overdraft revenue, but we'll -- I'll be responsive to the letter when I get it and we'll continue to provide the right services to our customer base.

wellsfargo,q1,2017,"Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions.
We generated $22 billion in revenue, reflecting lower fee income from a year ago, which was partially offset by a 5% increase in net interest income.
Cash and short-term investments reached an all-time high of $328.4 billion, up $41.7 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth in deposits and a linked quarter decline in the loan portfolio.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 7, I will be describing the biggest drivers of revenue and expense growth later on the call, so there was a couple of things Â points I want to make here.
As shown on Page 8, average loans increased 4% from a year ago, but declined $502 million from the fourth quarter as $5 billion of broad based growth in commercial loans was more than offset by declines in consumer loans, primarily in residential real estate.
The benefit from higher rates increased average loan yields 6 basis points in the quarter.
We had continued declines in our oil and gas portfolio, which was down 29% from a year ago and down $2 billion or 14% from the fourth quarter.
Our first mortgage loans declined $946 million from the fourth quarter due to continued runoff of higher yielding legacy portfolios, more than offsetting $4.1 billion of growth in non-conforming mortgage loans.
We will show more Â we will share more about our auto strategy at Investor Day. As highlighted on Page 11, our first quarter average deposits were a record $1.3 trillion, up $79.8 billion or 7% from a year ago with growth in both consumer and commercial deposits.
Our average deposit costs increased 7 basis points from a year ago and 5 basis points from the fourth quarter.
Net interest income increased 5% from a year ago, primarily driven by growth in loans and investment securities and the benefit of higher interest rates.
The net interest margin was flat from the fourth quarter as the benefit of higher interest rates, a reduction in short-term market funding and growth in average investment securities was offset by lower income from trading assets and mortgages held for sale, higher deposit and long-term debt balances and lower income from variable sources.
Non-interest income increased $522 million from the fourth quarter, driven by a lower net hedge ineffectiveness accounting impact in the fourth quarter as well as higher trading gains.
As shown on Page 15, expenses increased $577 million from the fourth quarter and $764 million from a year ago and our efficiency ratio increased to 62.7%.
As we discussed last quarter, we have been working on a number of initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion annually by year end 2018, with the full year benefit starting in 2019.
Turning to our business segments starting on Page 19, community banking earned $3 billion in the first quarter, down 9% from a year ago and up 10% from the fourth quarter.
The decline in non-interest income was driven by the impact from the sale of our crop insurance business last year, which generated a $381 million gain in the first quarter of Â16.
Wealth and investment management earned $623 million in the first quarter, up 22% from a year ago and down 5% for the fourth quarter.
First quarter results reflected strong growth in net interest income, up 14% from a year ago.
The benefit of higher market valuations and continued positive net flows led to another quarter of record WIM total client assets, up 9% from a year ago, to $1.8 trillion.
Non-performing assets continued to decline, down $698 million from the fourth quarter, with improvements across our portfolios and lower foreclosed assets.
Now, as it relates to the $2 billion of reductions that we have talked about previously, again as you highlighted, all those are going to be reinvested in growing the company and making the necessary investments for our success over the long-term.
One thing I would add, I think we will provide some more clarity at Investor Day that the $2 billion that we are talking about reinvesting, we are essentially reinvesting it today, and so there is a little bit ofÂ there needs to be more clarity I think on the Â on just the time element of what happens to the $2 billion to the extent that we are already in an elevated situation.
So where short-term rates are and are going is a big part of it, where long-term rates are matters a lot, because we generate interest income by investing at the longer end of the curve.
Erika, I think itÂs going to be a challenge to do that in terms of averaging that for the year.
When you put all the pieces in, a few moves, loan growth, deposit growth, investment activity, I think that sort of mid single-digit NII growth over the course of the year is a reasonable expectation.
John, my suggestion is we will provide you with more detail on that at Investor Day. I think there is Â thatÂs not a significant part of this $2 billion.
Along the lines of what John McDonald was just asking about, I just want to dig a little bit deeper on that side around expenses, whether it be on the branch side, 200 a year and also just looking at the size of the bank in the different businesses and the different markets you are in.
Yes, John, I would look forward to that at Investor Day. I mean, just to reinforce, right, 62.7% efficiency ratio, even taking out the seasonality in the first quarter is too high.
WeÂve got a $2 billion expense initiative that we have talked about a little over the last few quarters that is primarily focused on reinvesting for the long-term.
In addition to that, we appreciate that we have got to improve our operating efficiency Â our expense efficiency ratio and you will see more about that in Investor Day and you should expect a bigger number.
I had a question last quarter, you mentioned that you had proactively decided to keep I think itÂs the non-bank balance sheet in line with September 30 levels, I am just wondering if you persisted in that this quarter?
So I think we mentioned that in part, our net interest income was impacted to about $100 million for our average trading assets being lower.
I think the way that I would maybe try to categorize things is that the sale Â retail sales practices issues primarily impacted our retail banking business.
But I think the rest of the bank is continuing to perform well and the retail bank business is really performing better than the lowest points in the fourth quarter and the first quarter.
What I am trying to get at is, is there revenue thatÂs being suppressed from all of this, because there is a lot of metrics out there that itÂs hard to translate some of these retail banking metrics into revenues, the existing customer base seems to be performing well, if we look at your credit card balances overall, the fee revenues, so I think part of the pieces [ph] on the stock would be that you are under-earning now because of some of these issues impacting both revenue and expenses and I am just trying to square a lot of disclosures that are out there with that and again, you have provide us some metrics on the revenue expense, which is helpful, but thatÂs really the angle that I am coming from?
So itÂs not Â we donÂt want to get away from that, the fact that we think that we can continue to grow this company.
And then a bigger picture question related to the theme just in terms of how much time is senior management still spending on kind of all of these issues and you can include from a regulatory perspective thatÂs new in the last six months, the sales practices, if you had a percentage that you had to put on how much time you, John and the business has put towards this.
And then the same question for the line staff, because I would think at this point, the line staff is maybe starting to turn the page in terms of looking ahead more, but just trying to get a sense of maybe how things really feel inside at the different layers?
For example, we talked about the fact publicly that we established the rebuilding trust office, meaning that we didnÂt want lots of people to be spending 10% and 15% of their time on some of these issues.
And thatÂs what we are wrestling with, especially now that rates have rallied back and it looks less likely that sort of the investable part of the curve that we are talking about is going to be substantially higher in the future.
But I guess what I am getting at is how you think about balancing all those things in light of the sales fraud issues and the fallout from that and whether you think it is adversely impacting your ability to achieve positive operating leverage in terms of the magnitude and the timing of that in terms of pulling the cost lever maybe a little bit harder doing things like rationalizing branches.
I mean I think that when you step back and you look at the Â how serious the retail sales practice issues were and the reputational impact on the company, you can only reach that conclusion, right.
ItÂs had an impact in reference to MattÂs question about the time that we are spending in various activities, but I think itÂs making us a better company.
Having said that, hindsight is incredibly valuable when you look back at the reputational risk, reputational impact on the company and I think that based on the information that we had at the time, I think we made the appropriate decisions in terms of our disclosures.
But I think that the changes and the decision that we made over last 6 months has reinforced kind of the long-term view of how we manage credit at this company.
John, you spent a lot of time about the OCI and the work you guys have done there, have you had any success in trying to figure out how much, based on what the FedÂs balance sheet is today, $4.5 trillion and the talk of the unwinding thatÂs coming down the road maybe the next 12 months, do you guys have any estimate of what you think the impact on the 10-year government bond yield is due to the daily buying that the Fed does to maintain that $4.5 trillion balance sheet?
Over the long-term, we are going to do that and thatÂs what we will Â we will talk about that efficiency more at Investor Day. You said you are seeing progress in the retail bank, but you are not back to pre-settlement levels.
And so we certainly could imagine an environment where, letÂs say, the rate of new primary checking growth in Community Banking may be lower than pre-settlement levels, but the value and therefore the revenue impact over time might be higher.
It has been 7 months since the retail sales practices settlements, and we continued to take important steps in making things right with our customers and rebuilding trust.
This commitment has been demonstrated through our improving retail banking customer service scores, record client assets in wealth and investment management, including banker-closed referrals once again reaching $1 billion a month, more primary consumer checking customers and industry leading mortgage originations during the quarter.
We will talk more about specific areas of cost saves and reinvestments at our Investor Day in May. March retail banking customer activity is shown on Slide 3, which we have been updating monthly since October.
Starting with customer interactions on an average per day basis, total branch interactions declined 6% from February and declined 4% from a year ago.
And activity among our debit and credit card customers also remained strong, with debit card transactions and consumer credit purchase Â consumer credit card purchase volume both up 5% from a year ago on an average per day basis.
New consumer credit card applications increased 10% from February on an average per day basis, the largest month-over-month increase in September, but were still down from a year ago.
Point-of-sale active consumer credit card accounts were up 4% from a year ago.
We implemented our new retail banking compensation program early in the first quarter and initial survey results from our team members have been positive.
Another important step forward we are making is the launch of a new marketing campaign next week called Building Better Every Day. Also during the first quarter, our board accelerated its ongoing process of board refreshment by electing two talented new independent directors, Karen Peetz and Ron Sargent, to succeed long-serving board members.
We want Wells Fargo to be the financial services leaders Â leader in these six areas; customer service and advice, team member engagement, innovation, risk management, corporate citizenship and long-term shareholder value.
We will share our specific strategies we are taking to help achieve these goals at our Investor Day. There was a lot of economic volatility and uncertainty over this period and these steady results reflected the benefit of our diversified business model and its ability to perform consistently over time.
Period end loans grew 1% from a year ago and declined $9.2 billion or 1% from the fourth quarter.
Our commercial customers are generally optimistic about the current environment and this positive sentiment should lead to more loan growth as business activity and investing increase.
The commercial real estate portfolio increased $189 million in the fourth quarter with growth in the commercial real estate construction, which was diversified across geographies and asset types, partially offset by declines in commercial real estate mortgages, driven by pay-downs.
Our credit card portfolio declined $2 billion from the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonal activity as customers paid down their holiday purchases.
The $1.9 billion decline in our auto portfolio reflected lower origination volumes, which were down 29% compared with a year ago.
The benefit from the interest rate increases as well as growth in average investment securities was offset by lower average trading assets and mortgages held for sale and typically lower first quarter income from variable sources.
Mortgage servicing income increased $260 million from the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower un-reimbursed servicing costs and lower prepayments.
We took actions last year that increased these un-reimbursed servicing costs, primarily in the fourth quarter.
Incentive compensation was up $80 million from a year ago, with approximately 40% of the increase from higher revenue-related incentive compensation costs.
The first quarter included approximately $80 million of expense related to sales practices matters and meaningful spending on regulatory and compliance initiatives, including regulatory and risk data, resolution planning and Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs.
These higher expenses were partially offset by $172 million of lower operating losses on lower litigation accruals in the first quarter compared with a year ago.
The primary driver of our ratio remaining above our internal target this quarter was lower RWA than last quarter and lower than forecasted in our 2016 capital plan, resulting from loan growth trends, continued credit discipline and improved RWA efficiency.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
I just have a clarification question, you both mentioned on the call in the prepared remarks that the 62.7% efficiency ratio is not acceptable, but youÂve also emphasized that the $2 billion currently identified cost savings wonÂt fall to the bottom line and your NII was down in a period where the Fed raised rates in December by 25 bps, so how do we square future efficiency ratio improvement from here when those two big pieces seem to be going the other way?
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
John, I wonder if you could talk more about that OCI risk management and the trade-off between that longer part of the curve, when we saw in your 10-K that the unrealized loss component did go up and it seems like you did reinvest a little less this quarter, can you just talk about like the balance between your decision tree on putting more into the book here and versus balance sheet risk and the decision tree between investment securities and maybe keeping more mortgages?
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.
Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan Chase.
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.
Our final question will come from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.

wellsfargo,q2,2017,"Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions.
While it improved from the first quarter, the efficiency ratio is still too high, operating at this level is just not acceptable and we are firmly committed to the goals we provided at Investor Day. As John will discuss later on the call, we are making progress on our ongoing expense initiatives which target $2 billion of expense saves by the end of 2018 that will support our investment in the business and an additional $2 billion of expense saves by the end of 2019 that is expected to go to the bottom line.
And while we are focused on reducing expenses and improving efficiency, we are continuing to invest in our businesses and in particular technologies that make it easier for our commercial and consumer customers to manage their finances.
We are also focused on improving the operating performance of the Company by increasing our emphasis on core banking products and services that we believe are most relevant for our customers and provide the best financial returns for our shareholders.
Before I turn the call over to John to discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to again highlight the efforts of our 271,000 team members who work hard each and every day to fulfill our vision of helping our customers to succeed financially, which results in such strong operating performance for our shareholders.
We had growth across a number of businesses, including $1.1 billion in Government and Institutional Banking, $605 million in Wells Fargo Commercial Capital, $469 million in Global Banking and modest growth in the middle market.
Commercial real estate loans declined $982 million from the first quarter and while we remain the largest CRE lender in the country, our growth has been modestly below that of the industry for the first half of this year.
Our first mortgage loans increased $1.9 billion from the first quarter, reflecting $7.3 billion of growth in non-conforming mortgage loans, partially offset by the continued run-off of higher yielding legacy portfolios, including the sale of $569 million Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio.
As a result of tightening underwriting standards, the quality of originations has improved with the quarterly average FICO of 719 at origination in the second quarter, up from 696 a year-ago.
We expect auto loans to continue to decline in the second half of this year.
The increase from the first quarter reflected the benefit of the repricing of earning assets due to higher short-term interest rates, which exceeded the associated cost of repricing liabilities.
The rate of growth during the second half of the year will be dependent on a variety of factors including the level and slope of the yield curve as well as deposit betas and earning asset growth trends.
Non-interest income declined $743 million from a year-ago, driven by lower market sensitive and mortgage banking revenue, while non-interest income was down only $16 million from the first quarter.
Deposit service charges were down $37 million from the first quarter, reflecting a higher earnings credit rate for commercial customers and lower consumer and business checking service charges.
Mortgage banking non-interest income declined $80 million from the first quarter, residential mortgage origination volume increased $12 billion or 27% from the first quarter on higher purchase volume, reflecting seasonality and a strong purchase market.
We continue to make progress on efficiency initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion annually by year-end 2018 with the full-year benefit starting in 2019.
Turning to our Business segments starting on Page 19, Community Banking earned $3 billion in the second quarter, down 6% from a year-ago and down 1% from the first quarter.
As we discussed at Investor Day, we're making a shift in how we report activity to highlight metrics we believe best show how we're managing the business today and our most important to our long-term success.
As we show on Slide 20, existing customers continue to actively use their accounts, branch and ATM interactions were up 3% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality and we're down 3% from a year-ago.
Primary consumer checking customers increased from a year-ago, although the rate of growth has continued to slow active consumer general purpose credit card accounts were up 2% from both the first quarter from a year-ago.
Wholesale Banking earned $2.4 billion in the second quarter, up 15% from a year-ago and up 13% from the first quarter.
It's also important to note that prior year results included the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business.
Wealth and Investment Management earned a record $682 million in the second quarter, up 17% from a year-ago and up 9% from the first quarter.
Our consumer real estate portfolios both first and second lien mortgages were actually in a net recovery position in the second quarter, demonstrating the significant improvement in the residential real estate market and the quality of loans we put on our balance sheet.
Well, I think Â Betsy that's one of the reasons why we wanted to provide some additional granularity in the slides in terms of where we're seeing loan growth.
I think the loan growth trends continue to be good with the headwind that we're having just in terms of the absolute number being the run-off of the junior lien mortgage portfolio and then the impact from auto.
I just wonder if you could give us a sense as to how you're thinking about the businesses that you want to retain, attract, invest in versus the ones that you are deciding to move away from because frankly, in conversations with investors, the insurance -- that was a bit of a surprise to people, thought was that it was good for CCAR and ROE, albeit had a higher expense ratio.
And then likewise, on the insurance business, recall a couple Â or three years ago, we sold the non-footprint offices in our commercial insurance brokerage business because there just wasn't much connection there with our existing business and as we looked at the insurance business, again it was performing fine, but candidly I think that that it might Â we thought it might work better with others and we're very pleased with the buyer USI.
So a lot of good details on the expenses, the drivers of Â with the $2 billion net will come from I think it's all very helpful and at the back half of the year commentary I think itÂs positive.
Well, for the reasons we've talked about before, it's tough to give an absolute number, because so much of our expense is driven by the business results that are happening in any given quarter because they are related to production levels, et cetera.
What costs are we taking out because there is non-value added, and we're improving the Company and where we signaling that we're going to run the Company over time, 55% to 59% as opposed to a specific dollar, which reflects more assumptions and it's reasonable to make about what our business mix is at that time what our production levels are at that time.
I think in Investor Day, you're kind of targeting low single-digit loan growth for the year in terms of low single-digits, any change there after the results this quarter?
Yes, well, so there's a lot that's going to happen with NIM trajectory and I'd say the biggest drivers to look for Â part of it is earning asset mix and the rate of growth in loans and of course what kind of loans we put on the books.
But at least in the short to medium-term probably more impactful is what's going on with deposit pricing, because we have been outperforming the beta that we showed to you at our Investor Day by a reasonable amount, especially on the consumer and small business side of things.
And so as we sit around and think about the next six to 12 months and what happens with rates and what happens with net interest income whether or not we continue to outperform our modeled expectations on deposit repricing is really one of the big drivers, obviously deposit growth, loan growth, deployment into securities all matter, but I would focus on deposit pricing in the near-term.
I wanted to focus my line of questioning in terms of the revenue progress thatÂs underlying your goal to get back to your efficiency range and maybe it's good to just jump off from KenÂs line of questioning, you mentioned the betas are going to be a big swing factor, and I'm wondering how you're thinking about the sensitivity of outflow in beta as the Fed begins to reduce their balance sheet and how it would impact you specifically?
Erika, just to reinforce JohnÂs point, I think that's why itÂs really important from our perspective to make sure that we're investing in our products and services convenience as John mentioned for our consumer customers that is Â that when you are in an environment where it is uncertain, I mean the Fed has never had a balance sheet of this size.
And the final question just on the fee side, if you take out the gain on the PCI loans, the run rate is something like $9.4 billion and as we're looking forward to efficiency improvement for the second half of the year from the 61%.
Most of them are in line with the five-quarter averages and I'd say mortgage is probably the item to look at in terms of what's the size of the market, what the composition of the market and what's going on with margins that reflects competition.
I think that you're likely to see a continued decline in the auto portfolio through the second half of this year and my bet is it will probably stabilize sometime in the first half of next year.
I think that we're seeing actually some very good results in terms of customer experience and a continued improvement in customer loyalty.
Yes, I wouldn't attribute any of the decline in sales practices, I think again the second quarter tends to have a lot of seasonality in it particularly on the consumer and the wealth side because folks get their tax refunds and then they use them.
We're not trying to be all things to all people, but gosh, if you look over the last five years or so, I think we've been growing those activities that are kind of mid double-digit rate.
And in fact, one example of that is, you saw the growth and balances in the second quarter of $1.1 billion in our Government and Institutional Banking business.
And our expectation is that we will continue to grow this business in the short term.
We had very strong credit results with the net charge-off rate declining to 27 basis points, the lowest level IÂve seen during my nearly 30 years at Wells Fargo reflecting our consistent risk management.
During the second quarter, we rolled out Zelle, a P2P payment platform for 28 million digital customers, provided enhancements for our Treasury Management customers to streamline and automate accounts receivable, launched a chatbot pilot for Facebook Messenger, began the rollout of new streamlined mobile checking account opening experiences for our customers, and launched a new service for commercial card customers that allows them to upload and manage receipts with their mobile device.
This week, we received preliminary court approval for the $142 million settlement agreement for a class action lawsuit concerning retail sales practices, including providing an avenue for customers whose credit was harmed to seek compensation.
So I'll just highlight the decline of 82 million common shares outstanding over the past year, reflecting our strong capital return through a net share repurchases.
This included discrete tax benefits totaling $186 million or approximately $0.04 per share, primarily as a result of our agreement to sell Wells Fargo Insurance Services.
The growth was partially offset by $620 million decline in financial institutions from actions we've taken to lower exposure in certain emerging markets and decreased demand.
Let me explain the $1.9 billion linked quarter decline in consumer loan portfolio in some more detail.
Our junior lien mortgage loan portfolio continued to decline as expected as pay-downs more than offset new originations.
While consumer loan growth will continue to be impacted by the actions we're taking in our auto portfolio and the expected run-off of legacy junior lien mortgage loans, we are making some modest changes to generate new loan originations, including offering interest-only jumbo mortgage loans to high quality borrowers and testing credit card offerings through our digital channels.
While we've implemented some incremental commercial deposit repricing in line with the market was not made material changes in rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits as we've seen very little market response in these categories.
The net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 2.9% driven by higher short-term interest rates, disciplined deposit pricing and a reduction in long-term debt, which were partially offset by the impacts from lower loan and investment securities balances.
However, non-interest income declined $202 million from the first quarter on lower net gains from trading activities.
$81 million of the decline was from lower deferred compensation plan investment results, which was largely offset in employee benefits expense.
Partially offsetting these increases were $152 million of lower revenue related expenses primarily from lower commissions and other incentives in Mortgage and Wholesale Banking.
The Community Banking team continues to work on making changes that will further improve the customer and team member experience.
We highlighted last quarter then in March; we had our first $1 billion month of closed referred investment assets from the partnership between Wealth and Investment Management and Community Banking since the sales practices settlement.
WIM total client assets were a record $1.8 trillion, up 8% from a year-ago, driven by continued positive net flows and higher market valuations.
Non-performing assets continued to decline, down $827 million from the first quarter with improvements across all commercial portfolios and consumer real estate portfolios as well as lower foreclosed assets.
We shared updates throughout the call today on progress we've made toward our goal of being the financial services leader in six areas; customer service and advice, team member engagement, innovation, risk management, corporate citizenship, and long-term shareholder value.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
I mean I think our general assessment is if they start selling long duration assets, I know that there are people who believe that depositors will rush out of bank deposits and rush into mortgages in 10 years.
Yes. So I think mortgage banking could be a little bit more volatile.
Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.
Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
So it's really going to reflect taking business from other people and getting more than our fair share of new household formation or new bank customer formation as it happens over time.
Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
And couple of years ago on Investor Day, we actually had a mortgage banking Â talk about [indiscernible] finally turn the corner after we come out of this financial crisis.
One more thing IÂd add Marty that doesn't show up in the mortgage banking line item, but we're making non-conforming prime jumbo mortgage loans handover for our best customers and then they show up on our balance sheet.
",44.61,0.7782593
wellsfargo,q3,2017,"Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions.
While this accrual impacted our financial performance in the quarter, the commitment of our team members to put our customers first and help them to succeed financially remains strong and was demonstrated by average deposits growing 4% from a year ago, client assets reaching record levels in wealth and investment management, debit card purchase volume increasing 5% from a year ago, balances in our consumer and general purpose credit card portfolio also growing 5%.
One reason I am confident that we are on the right path is it in the third quarter total team member attrition at Wells Fargo reached its lowest level in over six years.
While branch customer loyalty and satisfaction with most recent visit scores decline slightly in September after our announcement of the completion of the expanded third party account review, both metrics had reached individual post sales practices settlements high earlier in the quarter.
This quarter we did not have a release as improvements and credit performance in certain portfolios were offset by a $450 million of reserve coverage for potential hurricane related losses based on initial review of our portfolio.
H.8 data continue to indicate that there was softness across the industry, particularly in certain categories like C&I, but they're also specific actions that we've taken, primarily driven by our own risk discipline, which have impacted our growth.
Our credit portfolio increased $944 million linked quarter driven by higher spend per active account.
The net interest margin declined 3 basis points to 2.87% as the impact of lower investment portfolio yields driven by accelerated prepayments, lower average loan balances, growth in average deposits and growth in trading assets and related funding were partially offset by lower average long-term debt and a modest benefit from all other growth and repricing.
Card purchase volume increased but card fees declined $19 million from the second quarter due to higher reward expense.
Servicing income declined $91 million from the second quarter primarily due to higher on reimburse direct servicing cost driven by an increased and estimated cost for aged FHA foreclosures while origination volume increased, residential mortgage origination revenue decline due to a lower repurchase reserve release.
Despite decline in customer trading activity, revenue driven by lower volatility and seasonally lower trading volumes, trading related revenue increased $52 million from the second quarter.
The reason why our 2017 efficiency ratio is now expected to be higher than we anticipated last quarter is due to lower than expected earning asset growth and higher than expected expenses, primarily for cyber regulatory initiatives and data modernization.
As you can see on Page 14, we had linked quarter declines across many of our expense categories except for revenue related expenses and running the business non discretionary expenses which is a category impacted by the $1 billion litigation accrual.
The increase in revenue related expenses was primarily due to higher commissions and other incentive compensation driven by wholesale banking and brokerage.
Third party service expense declined $82 million from the second quarter driven by lower project related, legal and outside data processing expense.
Revenue related expense declined $131 million from lower commission and incentive compensation driven by lower mortgage and wholesale banking activity.
On Page 19, we highlight customers continue to actively use their accounts; branch and ATM interactions declined 6% from a year ago.
Primary consumer checking customers declined modestly from the second quarter in a year ago, while our attrition rates have remained stable, the decline in new account openings has impacted primary consumer checking customer growth.
Customer experience survey scores predictably declined after we announced the completion of the expanded third party review of retail banking accounts at the end of August.
It's more than being nice it's offering the right products and services to meet the financial needs of our customers; it's also about making changes with real customer impact for example empowering managers in the branches to immediately resolve some customer issues such as fees and service request rather than having to redirect customers to a call center.
Turning to credit quality on Page 23, the quarterly loss rate was 30 basis points, up 3 basis points from the second quarter but still near historically low levels.
We did not have a reserve build or release this quarter as continued improvement in consumer real estate and commercial loan portfolios including continued improvement in the oil and gas portfolio was offset by a $450 million of reserve coverage for potential hurricane related losses based on an initial review of our portfolio.
Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.
Yes. We've got different categories of earnings assets they are priced differently investment securities loans, short -term investment et cetera.
Can you just talk about end demand and try to separate end demand and customer growth from perhaps any lagging ramification of retail sales and the slower account growth in terms of how you expect loans to traject going forward?
I think the home equity portfolio will also continue to decline though our expectation is that next year all other things being equal will originate more home equity loan than what we did this year.
Even maybe some granularity there in terms of -- I know the specifics that John mentioned but obviously C&I had slowed overall and what do you just seeing in terms of customer demand and where that growth would come from inside that commercial business ?
If you overlay the current economic environment we continue to believe that losses will probably bounce around at lower rate ex things like the impact from the hurricanes but overall the portfolio has never been in any better shape in my 30 years at the company so we continue to be optimistic.
Your next question comes from the lines of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.
I mean you guys definitely been more aggressive recently than you had been over say the last several years and sort of pairing back where appropriate but I guess increasingly I am finding myself getting questions about why your branch footprint shouldn't be like 1,000 or so branches, if you are just given how many more branches you have been -- the other biggest players in the country so just curious if you could maybe offer a little color on sort of how you are thinking about the appropriateness of the footprint as look you forward and what any additional opportunities might be?
We transaction billions of dollars, billions of interactions each quarter but over 50 millions time a month somebody still comes into our branches and they want to be able to use them.
Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
Is there any possibility that, that type of product whether it was an interest only product for a 10-year term, would those come back when you think about growing the portfolio since they performed so much better than expected.
Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.
Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
In the third quarter, we earned $0.84 a share; including the impact of a $1 billion discrete litigation accrual for previously disclosed mortgage related regulatory investigations.
As we committed to a year ago we reviewed more accounts over a longer period of time and identified additional customers who may have been impacted.
Cash and short-term investments increased to $7.4 billion, reflecting lower loan balances and growth in deposits.
Starting with commercial loans on Page 7, lien utilization rate remain stable at approximately 40% in the third quarter and balance is increased $3.7 billion from a year ago, but declined $5.7 billion from the second quarter.
We provided $6.5 billion of financing relating to our government guarantee student loan sale in the fourth quarter of 2014 which is then securitized in several tranches over the past couple of years with $1.3 billion remaining at the end of the third quarter down approximately $800 million from the second quarter.
We fully anticipated the run down of a couple of loan portfolios we acquired from GE Capital and pay downs have totaled $7.9 billion over the past 18 months including $1.7 billion in the third quarter with approximately half of the reduction in the quarter in C&I and half in commercial real estate.
However, consumer loans increased $200 million from the second quarter with growth in first mortgage loans and credit card.
Our first mortgage loans increased $3.6 billion from the second quarter, reflecting $7.5 billion of growth in non-conforming mortgage loans, partially offset by the continued run-off of higher yielding legacy portfolios.
In terms of credit card portfolio, over the past three years our annual growth rate was the largest among the large banks.
Our auto portfolio continued to decline as expected and was down $2.5 billion from the second quarter as a result of tightening underwriting standards.
Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $252 million from the second quarter driven by declines in personal loans and lines which we expect to continue to decline due to lower branch referrals over the past year.
As highlighted on Page 9, average deposits were $1.3 trillion, up $44.9 billion or 4% from a year-ago and up $5.2 billion from the second quarter.
Net interest income increased $524 million, or 4% from a year-ago primarily driven by growth in earnings assets and higher interest rates.
However, net interest income declined $7 million from the second quarter as the impacts of lower investment portfolio yields driven by accelerated prepayments and lower average loan balances were largely offset by the impact of one additional day in the quarter and a modest benefit from all other growth and repricing.
Non-interest income declined $926 million from a year-ago, driven by lower mortgage banking revenue and was $236 million from the second quarter.
As shown on Page 13, expenses increased $810 million from the second quarter, driven by $1 billion litigation accrual.
The $665 million increase in running the business in non-discretionary expense was driven by higher operating losses reflecting the $1 billion litigation accrual.
It's also important to note that these initiatives do not include the benefit of the expected run-off of core deposit intangibles by 2019 which resulted in $640 million of expenses in the first nine months of the year.
Turning to our business segments starting on Page 18, Community Banking earned $2.2 billion in the third quarter, the impact from $1 billion litigation accrual which is reported in this segment was the primary driver of the year-over-year and linked quarter decline.
While this past year has been challenging, the numbers we've made are creating more consistency -- the changes we've made are creating more consistency and simplicity for our branch team members which will result in a better experience for our customers.
John, I want to try again to ask about the idea of the timing differences between initial $2 billion of expense saves to be realized by the end of next year.
So it's not dollar for dollar if as these things roll off and that first $2 billion gets realized those benefit, but with respect to efficiency ratio we think that will be sort in the -- as I mentioned plus or minus 61% from the fourth quarter and it is definitely our goal to be at 59% or below at some point next year.
My first question is for you Tim. I think that as I speak with your current and prospective shareholders, the biggest sort of question mark in terms of visibility into next year is not really on the expense management side but really on the revenue side.
And again I think wholesale banking performance in the quarter was good and I'd say the same thing for wealth and investment management.
John provided a number of details in his presentation as it relates to some of our consumer businesses but for the rest of the company we are continuing to move forward.
And I am wondering as we think about 4Q, 2019, John, is it a simple as saying okay let's assume a core run rate for Wells Fargo, let's say it's the $13.3 billion this quarter excluding the $1 billion in litigation accrual, assume a growth rate off of that and then deduct $500 million.
We don't know what's going to happen at the longer end but and the big question mark about that is what is the deposit response in retail that bigger banks either cause or impacted by on the next move because we model a reasonably meaningful response and yet we haven't seen what yet so there could be upside to that.
So as we've highlighted for last few quarters, I think it's likely that the auto portfolio will continue to decline over the next few quarters.
Having said all that, the reason we became the largest lender in this country is because we look at the market, we look at our customer demand and we want to make sure we are making good, long-term credit decision.
Oh I think again we called out some specifics for example in this quarter we had a number of larger CRE construction loans that paid off and that's again that's going to be little bit episodic but overall view is that we are going to see growth across the entire portfolio again because we are in so many businesses, each business is going to have a little bit different complexion in the quarter.
And then going forward what you see is a lot less volatility and the reason of course we are adopting it is because we are creating this noise in non-interest income that was bouncing around to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter that was just as a result of different evaluation schemes for the liability lag and the hedge lag and things that were permanently hedged.
So by doing this we think we open up more flexibility for Wells Fargo going forward and as you mentioned the industry got word that there will be instead of an annual cycle, at least this time an extra year and so whether we wait and file at the end of that period or we file at the middle of that period, we haven't really figured out yet but the intention is to move towards SPOE and we thought that the investment community should know that.
And if we think that there is more opportunity from a risk-reward standpoint as it relates to credit and we will take advantage of that but I think the decisions we've made over the last year had really worked because when you look at the average FICO scores of our customers, we did now increase and that's exactly what we wanted.
Even said all that I think you should expect that portfolio -- I am not being negative I just want to make sure you reinforce the comment I made to Ken, you should expect the portfolio even if we turn things up a notch to continue to decline through the fourth quarter this year through most of the next year and probably bottom out again sometime hopefully at the second half of next year.
Don't get us wrong and our expectation is over time we will continue to gain share in that business but right now we are cautious and we got lot of changes going into the business and we got to execute those.
And I'll be quick on this one but the way we should think about with loan growth and the potential impact of the sales practice in card and auto insurance issues that if those issues did not happen at all.
I can't commit to you Matt that we've finished everything because things are still in progress but we are very far along but I think it's also important to reinforce -- our review of all of our policies, procedures, practices is going to continue for a long time meaning that we got to continue to ask more of ourselves everyday.
And if you had to guess I mean how much longer until you can say we've look through everything, this is what we found, we are done and I kind of appreciate that so issues can pop-up at any company at any time but when you kind of put the stake on the ground and say, we've been through everything, it's a big company, lots of businesses, lots of employees and we are moving forward and I kind of 100% guarantee nothing will pop up but like we are essentially on par with everybody else and we are feeling good from here.
And that is really been I think reflective of you wanting to especially with corporate and wealth management customers not giving any other reasons in this period to work anywhere else.
This is about if you are going online, you are Wells Fargo customer, you type in a little bit information like who you are and you want to mortgage and we pre populate your application so that you are not -- we are not asking you and you are not having to give for the 44 time where you live, how much you make and it's using the trusted data that we have here.
The larger originators we would be one and our other bank competitors or the other have just said you know what we are not going to sign up for the fact that 10 years from now somebody could come back and say I mortgage the originated today defaulted at that point in time.
And then just lastly, you guys talked about your expense initiative, of course, and it's $4 billion that you're going to reduce, I think you, John, pretty clear, that the expectations for the reduction in expenses do not include the core deposit premiums that you've been running every year, also the FDIC special assessment and then also expenses associated with businesses that you sold of.
And when you think about what -- how that sales practices settlement and related reputational impact affected our team and our customers particularly in the third and the fourth quarter, and then Mary and team have been making fundamental changes to the business in terms of a new incentive plan, going through reducing a layer of management in terms of new training and just there has been so much going on.
What we are seeing right now in our branches our team members that are so much more confident and working so much better with their customers to provide them with solutions and I think you are going to see that in not only continued improvement in customer experience and loyalty scores but you are going to see that in terms of growth.

wellsfargo,q4,2017,"We believe that using data and technology to help our customers better manage their finances will enable us to grow and build more long-term relationships.
In 2018, we expect additional innovations including instant issuance of debit cards to customers in mobile wallets and control tower, a central hub for customers to view and manage the places where their Wells Fargo cards and account information is stored.
In addition to these innovations, we rely on our team members to help drive an exceptional customer experience and in 2017 we took a number of steps to enhance team member benefits, including adding four additional paid holidays, announcing plans to grant restricted stock rights to approximately 250,000 team members, and increasing the minimum base pay for all U.S. based team members.
While it's too early to determine the full impact, it appears that tax reform will benefit our customers and help grow the U.S. economy and surveys indicate business confidence has increased.
Our efforts to transform Wells Fargo were evident in our results in 2017, including record deposit balances, improved retail banking household retention, increased brand satisfaction with most recent visit scores, which are now back to the levels we had prior to the sales practice settlements, growth in debit card and credit card purchase volume, both up 6% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, record levels of client assets in wealth and investment management, historically low credit losses, exceptionally strong capital and liquidity levels.
Our results also include an $848 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services which benefited EPS by $0.11, and we had a $3.25 billion litigation accrual in the quarter for a variety of matters including mortgage related regulatory investigations, sales practices and other consumer related matters.
If the tax act drives stronger, industry loan growth this year, deposit betas could be impacted somewhat as market demand for deposits increases to fund this growth.
Our full year 2017 net interest income increased 4% consisting with the expectation we provided at Investor Day. Similarly, our NIM was down 2 basis points to 284 as the negative impacts from the adjustment related to leverage leases and growth in average deposits was partially offset by lower average long-term debt and a modest benefit from all other growth repricing and variable terms.
However, it's important to note, that during the extended period of loan interest rates since these swaps we're entered into they generated incremental revenue of approximately $3 billion for Wells Fargo.
Servicing income declined $47 million, primarily from lower net hedge results due to the impact of changes in MSR valuation assumptions, including the impact of increasingly competitive industry pricing, lower carry on our MSR hedge in the flatter yield curve environment and increased customer payment deferrals in areas impacted by recent hurricanes.
The $142 million increase from the third quarter in compensation and benefits expense reflected higher stock award expense, primarily from stock price and performance impacts on prior period awards.
As a reminder the first $2 billion of targeted expense saves by year end 2018 supports our ongoing investment in the businesses which includes a number of key areas such as enhancing our compliance and risk management capability, building a better bank and strengthening our core infrastructure.
I believe the transformational changes weÂre making to better meet our customers financial needs including providing bankers with innovative tools to enable more meaningful financial conversations with our customers not only improves customer service, but will also drive growth.
We're on track to achieve our expense targets and the transformational changes we're making throughout Wells Fargo will help us achieve our six goals and drive our long-term success.

WeÂre not -- we donÂt really normalize our 2017 expenses and I think many people would obviously look to take out their larger operating losses that we experienced.
I would say that we donÂt think that we have to do too much, although again if thereÂs a big cyclical change that causes betas to catch up to where people might have previously imagined they should be, looking at prior cycles of rate increases, then if weÂre looking for a catalyst or imagining one that could cause that, one of the things that could cause it is a big pick up in loan demand, it hasnÂt been there.
But the industry overall has -- should be thinking about whether an increase in loan demand overall changes the calculus for deposit pricing.

Thank you very much for those comments on CNBC this morning, my mother thinks -- youÂre now her favorite analyst.
Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.
Our next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
I don't think our view particularly as it relates to retail consumer customers has really changed.
But itÂs really some purpose to do more business of various types with those customers by having that deposit relationship.
Our final question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Can you share with us what kind of penetration you have whether itÂs credit cards or other types of consumer loan products that youÂre actually opening up through the online channel versus people having to come into a branch?
Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions.
Our results in the fourth quarter were strong and they included a net benefit from the tax cuts and Job Act. Other items that impacted our results in the fourth quarter included, the gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, and higher litigation accruals.
On page 6, we provide more details on the impacts of the Tax Act. The estimated tax benefit from the reduction to net deferred income taxes was $3.89 billion, was somewhat unique in that the tax effective, our temporary difference results in a net deferred tax liability which is primarily driven by differences between the book and tax treatment of our leasing and mortgage servicing businesses and mark-to-market timing differences.
Our net interest income for full year 2018 will be dependent on a variety of factors including the level and of slope of the yield curve as well as deposit betas and earning asset growth trends.
This increase included the benefit of the $848 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, which was partially offset by a $414 million reduction from impairments on low income housing and renewable energy investments resulting from the tax act.
Deposit service charges declined $30 million from the third quarter, driven by customer friendly changes including the launch of Overdraft Rewind in November which Tim highlighted at the start of the call.
On page 15, we provide details on our trading related revenue, which declined $49 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by declines in customer trading activity from lower volatility and compressed spreads.
2018 revenue which will impact the efficiency ratio will be influenced by a number of factors including the absolute level of rates, the shape of the yield curve, loan growth, deposit betas, credit spreads, cash redeployment and the absolute level of the equity markets.
We will provide guidance on the expenses for 2019 in our Investor Day in May. For the past couple of years, weÂve been taking a hard look at all of our businesses and their contributions and as a result weÂve had multiple divestitures, we thought it will be helpful to share the revenue and direct expense associated with the businesses we sold over the past two years, which we provide on page 22.
As a reminder, Wells Fargo Insurance Services was sold at the end of November and the share owner services is expected to close later in the first quarter.
On page 24, we highlight the customers continue to actively used their accounts, we have strong growth and digital secure sessions up 8% from a year ago and we continue to have declines in branch and ATM interactions reflecting the increased use of digital channels by our customers.
On page 25, we highlight balance and activity growth which included an increase of 6% in both credit and debit card purchase volume from a year ago.
Wholesale banking results in the fourth quarter included the gain on the sale of our insurance services business.
Our credit quality remained exceptionally strong, our loss rate for the full year was among the lowest in our history and in the fourth quarter our loss rate was 31 basis points of average loans.
And if you think about your new guidance for dollar expenses in 2018 and again fully acknowledging that you will get more color in May, is it fair to take that $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion range, assume a growth rate, and this is for 2020, assuming normal growth rate over the next two years and then take out the $2 billion in cost savings, the $769 million in CDI expense and the $573 million in sold business expense, isn't included?
First, I think it's absolutely fair and the feedback that we've been getting from our customers is that we should all be cautiously optimistic on the impact of the tax reform act on consumers.
And then likewise as John mentioned at it relates to auto, we believe that with all the changes that are going on in the auto portfolio, notwithstanding the underlying credit improvement and new originations, that we will see a continued decline in that portfolio throughout 2018 and in our current estimates this maybe, the lines will start to cross the fourth quarter this year may be first quarter 2019, itÂs -- we will find out.
And my answer continues to be very consistent and that is I think weÂve made a lot of progress in terms of looking at the operations of the company.
But I just canÂt provide you with that absolute guarantee at this moment in time, maybe someday I will, but I think itÂs going to be something we look at the rare view mirror over a longer period of time as opposed to having some inflection point today or tomorrow or the week after that.
Again, weÂve made a lot of progress, but as I reflect on my first year and a quarter in this role, I think itÂs fair to say that one of the mistakes that weÂve made at this company was that we didnÂt have a thorough enough review of the businesses on an ongoing basis.
I think John mentioned in the fourth quarter that he thought we'd see 4% to 5% type revenue growth this year.
A large part of the increase in the fourth quarter to your point was related to higher underlying values, but again that tends to drive revenues in future too.
But we continue to be optimistic about that business and to reinforce John's point about the improvement in referrals from community banking to wealth and investment management.
Quick question on the loan growth, it looks like CRE was loan growth again this quarter and you did mention that you saw focusing on continued credit discipline.
But I am pleased with the progress and our expectation for 2018 as we are going to see checking account growth, I would also say -- primary checking account growth, I would also say an improvement over what you saw in the fourth quarter but I would also say that underlying value of those accounts has increased, and weÂve talked about that at Investor Day last year.
The C&I loans, credit card and first mortgage is likely where our net loan growth is going to come from in 2018 and similar to the quarter.
But as it relates to capital return, I think that I said it early in the call and John repeated it that weÂre pleased to have increased the amount of capital returned to our shareholders by 16% year-over-year and our expectation is that we will continue to increase capital return because we have excess capital at the company to fund our growth.
No, thatÂs right the I guess I was interpreting the question also mean deployment for growth and loan portfolio and that would be the first call on our capital share and make loans for our customers.
WeÂve got a lot of liquidity where we are not in a position where we think we need to attract a lot of incremental deposits to fund the next $10 billion of loans.
And we look at the pace of innovation particularly for us, I think thatÂs been one of the drivers and some of the reasons why weÂve been able to continue to attract deposits.
But, at this point may be at Investor Day it will be easier to think about the year as a whole because we will have a quarter and some change behind us.
But, I wouldnÂt pencil in last yearÂs growth rate this year until we get a little bit further into and we know what tax reform means and a couple of other things.
My general guess is that within the relevant range for likely loan growth for Wells Fargo, that if we achieve the higher end of that range, and the impact on our deposit price isn't really going to be because we think that we need to go out and raise more money and jack up our deposit cost, but rather that it's happening to others and they're doing it and we respond -- and if we feel we need to we will be responding to what's happening in the market.
I think when you move from traditional retail deposit customers to wealth customers, itÂs more competitive and youÂve seen the higher weighted there and weÂre kind of in the middle, and thatÂs fine with us.
I think that when we look at our branch network, we included a number of factors beyond just a P&L for the branch as a likely expectation for growth or quality of customers.

wellsfargo,q1,2018,"Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss preliminary results and answer your questions.
These actions are designed to help our customers succeed financially and to build long-term relationships, and we have made changes to compensation and processes in our branches which are also improving customer service, and in the first quarter customer loyalty survey scores reached their highest levels since August of 2016.
We closed 58 branches in the first quarter and we are on track to close approximately 300 branches this year, which is an increase [indiscernible] 250 branches we announced at our last Investor Day. As we highlighted last quarter, we currently expect our total branch network to decline to approximately 5,000 by the end of 2020.
Our revenue included a $643 million gain from sales of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans; $250 million in mark-to-market unrealized equity gains due to the new financial instruments accounting standard, which I'll discuss a little later on the call; a $202 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services; and $176 million reduction from a LOCOM adjustment relating to $1.9 billion of loans transferred to held-for-sale.
We are focused on compliance with the Consent Order's asset cap and maintaining liquidity and other financial risk management targets, while minimizing the impact to our customers, minimizing adverse long-term strategic effects, and maintaining our financial risk discipline.
Our balance sheet declined $36.4 billion from year-end, primarily due to a $32 billion decline in commercial deposits from financial institutions, including approximately $15 billion of actions taken to comply with the Consent Order asset cap.
We'd expect the earnings impact to increase in subsequent quarters but we continue to estimate that the net income after tax impact will be $300 million to $400 million for the full year of 2018.
I'm going to highlight much of what's on Page 4 later on the call, so let me just point out that the decline in deposits drove the $20 billion reduction in cash and short-term investments in the first quarter, and the decline in stockholders' equity was driven by a $2.8 billion decline in [OCI] [ph], resulting primarily from higher rates.
I will be highlighting our income statement drivers on Page 5 throughout the call, so let me just mention that we adopted new accounting standards in the first quarter, which we summarized on Page 17 and 18 of the earnings release.
The decline in loan balances were not related to any actions we took in connection with the Consent Order but was driven by opportunistic or strategic loan sales, seasonality, and continued declines in certain portfolios that we've been reducing for some time including auto, Pick-a-Pay mortgage, and junior lien mortgage loans.
I'll summarize the specific drivers of period-end loan declines starting on Page 7, but let me first point out that the average loan yields increased to 4.5% in the first quarter, the highest yield since the fourth quarter of 2012.
Auto loans were down $3.8 billion from the fourth quarter and included the transfer of $1.6 billion of loans to held-for-sale as a result of the pending sale of certain assets of Reliable Financial Services, a Puerto Rican subsidiary of our auto business.
With the completion of the centralization of our collection and funding activities, which Tim highlighted earlier, we're now positioned to start to increase originations over time and currently expect the portfolio of balances to begin growing in early 2019.
Our average deposit cost increased 6 basis points from the fourth quarter and was up 17 basis points from a year ago, versus the 75 basis point change in the Fed fund's rate.
Since the increase in interest rates began at the end of 2015, [indiscernible] price-sensitive commercial deposits have been relatively consistent with the prior interest rate cycles, and we expect this trend to continue.
The drivers of this reduction included an approximately $160 million decline from two fewer days in the quarter, $148 million from hedge ineffectiveness accounting, and $144 million in lower swap-related income related to the receive-fixed loan swap position that we finished unwinding early in the first quarter.
I also wanted to update that impacts from the tax act reduced our NIM by 4 basis points in both the fourth quarter from a one-time adjustment related to leverage leases and in the first quarter primarily from a decline in tax equivalent yield on municipal bonds.
Starting with deposit service charges, the $73 million decline from fourth quarter was driven largely by the impact of customer-friendly initiatives, including the first full quarter impact of Overdraft Rewind.
Given current market pricing trends, we would expect our production margin to continue to decline into the second quarter.
Turning to expenses on Page 12, expenses declined $2.6 billion from the fourth quarter, largely driven by $2.9 billion of lower operating losses.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $714 million in the first quarter, and similar to Wholesale Banking, the lower tax rate drove the growth in [net income] [ph].
Turning to Page 22, our credit performance remained strong in the first quarter and our loss rate was 32 basis points of average loans.
As you may recall, in the third quarter of last year we increased reserve coverage by $450 million for potential hurricane related losses based on an initial review of our portfolio.
In summary, our preliminary results in the first quarter continued to reflect strong asset quality, liquidity and capital, and we remain on track to achieve our target of $4 billion in expense saves by the end of 2019.
I wanted to ask you guys to talk a little bit more about the outlook for net interest income, and specifically, there are a lot of moving parts here with the asset cap impact, you mentioned it's supposed to increase from here, but then there is the benefits to come from the swap roll-off over time and the NII sensitivity improving, so can you help us just understand like do you have an expectation you can grow NII and what will drive that, will it be rate more than volume at this point?
At the longer end of the curve, we are continually reinvesting what's coming through in amortization and prepayments from a mortgage securities portfolio, and if long rates remain in the call it sub 2.80 range, then that won't be much of a driver.
One important point that I'd make that I don't think is really well appreciated is that a lot of what's been happening on the asset side of our books as we've run down some higher yielding assets on purpose is that there's an increase in overall credit quality that's coming with a lower spread component.
And so, I guess if I were modelling it, I would bleed it in, but we still think 300 to 400 of [indiscernible] is the right number and it was negligible in the first quarter because of just the seasonal roll-down in the size of the balance sheet, and so it's more of the second half of the year realization.
So just another somewhat related for you, Tim, with a lot of negative headlines in recent months, could you discuss how the team members and customers are dealing with the challenges here, specifically kind of how your employee and customer attrition, how has that been going in wealth management and the commercial businesses?
Just wanted to follow up on Ken's question on your net interest income outlook, so as I think about, John, what you mentioned about the 59% efficiency ratio by year-end 2018 being pushed to 2019, does that mean that net interest income will not grow for the rest of the year?
So, as I said to Ken, a variety of things could happen in loan growth, deposit growth, deposit pricing, shape of the curve, Fed moves, et cetera, they are all going to have an impact on where net interest income is.
I mean, Erika, our plans, and John and I have reiterated this on a number of occasions over the last few months, is that we have an excess amount of capital to run and grow Wells Fargo and our plan is to reduce that excess over the next two to three years, and that's where we're going.
And the question, explicit or implicit, as to what that means this year given other things that are going on is one that makes us work that much harder to make sure that we have submitted a very sound plan based on a very sound process, and that's where we think we are.
And John, again, we'll provide a hard dollar number or a range like we did for this year at Investor Day, but assume that that's what you're going to hear.
And then separately, there is what's happening with revenue, which is going to reflect all the things that we just talked about in terms of net interest income and then a range of drivers in noninterest income, more of which we'll talk about in Investor Day. But I sort of think about it as a distribution of potential outcomes based on what's happening with rates and interest income drivers, what's happening in all of our various businesses around noninterest income, and then what we're doing about total expense to deliver it.
No, but I think it seems like the legacy related costs could be elevated this year, the Consent Order is going to be a drag to earnings into next year.
So, that was another one of the things that contributed to the margin not reflecting the benefit of the increase at the short end of curve, and that is a result mostly of a big move up in long rates during the quarter, which gave rise to that accounting outcome.
Our sort of ambient run rate of operating losses for fraud and bank robberies and things like that is $150 million a quarter.
I guess a broader question, John, you mentioned your stock will take care of itself if you can continue to do 15% ROTCEs and 12% [indiscernible] 120 basis points ROAs, and I suspect we will hear more about this at your Investor Day, but this quarter also did have a lot of noise in it, maybe net-net been more positive than negative, but when we compare you to your peers, you are no longer sort of at the top of your peer group in number of performance metrics, and I guess the question is, how important is it to be in the top of your peer group and is it still something that is feasible and is it still something that is important or do you really need to get past your issues, all the issues that have risen that becomes a primary goal or should be a primary goal of the Company?
But as a result, [indiscernible] are happy with their relationship with Wells Fargo, we end up with a large and low-cost deposit base.
I thought the questions were very good and we are going to continue to listen to all the advice that you provide to us, and for our team members that are mentioning today, I want to thank you for all of your hard work and effort as you continue to transform Wells Fargo.
Good morning and thank you for joining us today.
These preliminary results are subject to change due to our ongoing discussions that we are having with the CFPB and OCC to resolve matters regarding our compliance risk management program and our past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions, which the CFPB and the OCC have collectively offered to resolve for an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties.
Our results also included a $550 million reserve release, driven by a significantly improved outlook on hurricane related losses.
We have also maintained our credit risk discipline for new originations in commercial real estate during a period of high liquidity and increased competition, resulting in four consecutive quarters of lower balances.
Commercial loans were relatively flat compared with fourth quarter, with C&I loans up $1.6 billion offset by continued declines in commercial real estate due to continued credit discipline in a competitive highly liquid financing market as well as ongoing paydowns on existing and acquired loans.
Consumer loans declined $9.5 billion [indiscernible] fourth quarter.
Average consumer and small business banking deposits declined $2.1 billion as higher community bank deposits were more than offset by lower deposits in Wealth and Investment Management, reflecting movement into other investments.
The $2.6 billion decline in running the business non-discretionary [indiscernible] category reflected lower operating losses.
Our total FTE were down 3% from a year ago and also reflected lower FTE in Community Banking and consumer lending.
On Page 15 we highlight the expected full-year 2018 total expense range, which has not changed since we provided it last quarter.
We will provide a dollar range for 2019 expenses at our Investor Day in May. The expected decline in revenue from the balance sheet actions needed to comply with the Consent Order's asset cap will likely result in our efficiency ratio remaining above 59% throughout this year.
The release this quarter also reflected continued improvement in residential real estate and lower loan balances.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
But I guess what I'm getting at is the 55% to 59% range that you had provided previously and before some of these issues, how long do you think it takes you to get towards that midpoint again, barring new issues on the regulatory front coming up?
Okay, thanks Tim. John R.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
This quarter we actually saw a nice pop in [indiscernible] plus no loss, a little bit [indiscernible] impact also a little bit and they count, but is this the first time that we're going to see those asset yields move up enough to offset and even pace faster than deposit rates and maybe start to see margin expansion from here?
Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Just wanted to see if that cleans that issue up or is there still more reserve release that could happen based on loan performance from the hurricane side?
So, on the hurricane side, just for everyone's benefit, at the end of the third quarter, right after the hurricanes impacted Texas and Louisiana and then Puerto Rico had hit, we granted 90 day payment holidays to our consumer customers in those geographies so they could focus on getting their live together and not worrying about making a payment on their loans and becoming or become [indiscernible].
Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.
Our final question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Our ability to significantly increase our returns demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model, our sound financial risk management practices and our strong capital position, which is a result of the capital we built in recent years through continued stable earnings and a lower level of risk-weighted assets.
And while our effective income tax rate increased to 25.9% in the second quarter from this expense, we currently expect our effective income tax rate for the remainder of '18 to be approximately 19%, excluding the impact of any other future discrete items.
As we're highlighting on Page 3, operating losses in the second quarter were driven by a customer remediation for previously disclosed matters, all of which have been referenced in our recent 10-Q and 10-Q filings.
In the second quarter, we accrued $114 million to refund customers that may have been overcharged at any time during the past seven years.
During the second quarter, we also accrued additional amounts for remediation related to past practices in our automobile lending business, including insurance-related products, and related to mortgage interest rate lock extensions.
The decline in the balance sheet in the second quarter primary reflected lower deposits, driven by seasonality as well as commercial and Wealth and Investment Management customers allocating more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments.
First mortgage loans increased $343 million as high-quality, nonconforming loan origination growth was partially offset by $2.3 billion of lower Pick-a-Pay mortgage loans, including the sales of $1.3 billion of PCI loans.
However, junior lien mortgage originations grow in the second quarter, up 15% from a year ago.
There's typically a seasonal decline in deposits in the second quarter, which includes the impact of customer tax payments.
Wholesale Banking deposits declined $23.6 billion in the second quarter.
The decline in these deposits reflected temporary high levels of liquidity from the commercial payments business at the end of March as well as $3.9 million in actions taken in response to the asset cap.
Consumer and small business banking deposits declined $20.2 billion from the first quarter, driven by seasonality as well as customers allocating more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments.
Our NIM increased nine basis points to 2.93%, driven by a reduction in the proportion of lower-yielding assets, a less negative impact from hedge ineffectiveness accounting, and the net benefit of rate -- interest rate and spread movements.
Noninterest income declined $752 million from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage revenue and a reduction of $210 million from businesses we sold during the past year, which also reduced expenses.
It's also important to note that 46% of deposit service charges in the second quarter are from wholesale customers and are related to the Treasury Management fees they pay for services we provide to them.
The increase in expenses was also driven by $269 million in higher operating losses, primarily related to the customer remediation from previously disclosed matters that I highlighted earlier.
Community Banking earnings increased $583 million from the first quarter, driven by lower operating losses, partially offset by higher income taxes from the net discrete income tax expense in the second quarter.
Wholesale Banking earnings declined $240 million from the first quarter, which included a $202 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services.
Results in the second quarter included $171 million in operating losses related to the foreign exchange business, as I mentioned earlier.
Wealth and Investment Management earnings declined $269 million from the first quarter, driven by the impairment from the announced sale of our ownership stake in RockCreek and $114 million of operating losses related to fee calculations in certain fiduciary and custody accounts, as I also mentioned earlier.
Our credit card -- our strong credit results continued with our loss rate in the second quarter declining to 26 basis points of average loans, a historically low level.
In summary, our second quarter results continued to reflect strong credit quality, liquidity and capital.
John, I was wondering, in terms of the net interest income, is the $12.5 billion that you did this quarter, is that a fair jumping-off point for us to think about going forward?
And I think the biggest puts and takes are going to be what happens with both deposit and loan growth coming from separate drivers; what happens with, in particular, retail deposit betas, which as I pointed out have been outperforming our -- or the industry-modeled expectations and past performance; and then maybe, although not immediately, what happens at the long end of the curve as we continue to redeploy excess liquidity in our bond portfolio.
And in terms of excess liquidity, do you feel like you have a fair amount now relative to what you need for regulatory purposes, and it's just a question of the pricing and rates available that dictates how much you put to work?
And so we're going to continue to manage capital in an appropriate way, thinking on a multiyear period.
We were pleased to see, as John mentioned, originations in home equity pick up on a sequential-quarter basis and year-over-year, which was good.
Where the lines cross, as John mentioned earlier in terms of growing the overall portfolio, it's likely to happen in the -- sometime in the first half of next year, not 100% certain when.
On the origination side, I think we're going to continue to kind of be the Wells Fargo that's been around for decades, and that is that we're going to underwrite in an appropriate way.
I think historically when you look at periods of overcapacity in the mortgage business, the rationalization doesn't naturally clearly occur in the second and the third quarter because those are the quarters where you see the most originations.
I think the real benefit from our model, unlike maybe a monoline mortgage-only originator, is we've got the balance sheet product.
Going back to what you said to Betsy, Tim, about hopefully more earnings, I just wanted to ask about how we should think about the fee outlook ex mortgage.
That's a big impact that in terms of the math that you just described, I think our expectation is that trust and investment fees will continue to grow.
And for your peers of a similar size because you have larger investment banking and trading businesses, often investors expect a more sensitive flex to the expense base in terms of the relationship to fees.
I think kind of the middle-market demand is -- and we saw growth in our middle-market banking business, so that continues to be good.
But in terms of the -- our overall expenses for '19, this $52 billion to $53 billion that we're guiding to is a way to think about what that means in connection with run rate expenses, investment expenses, everything else that's going on.
Having said that, I think maybe because of our business model, the initial calculated impact to us is probably at the lower end of that range, especially for the larger banks.
We've talked about the competition for loans and the fact that we've got some portfolios running down on purpose, some where we've tapped the brakes like commercial real estate and auto, although we're probably more open for business in auto than we have been over the last several quarters.
John is going to provide more details on this income tax expense as well as other noteworthy items that impacted our results later in the call.
Our small business banking deposit customers can now apply and, if approved, immediately accept card payments and purchase processing equipment through one convenient online application at Wells Fargo Merchant Services.
And the millions of hours our team members volunteer each year contributed to Wells Fargo recently being named as one of the 50 most community-minded companies in the U.S. from the Points of Light organization.
These efforts are reflected in continued declines in voluntary team member attrition, which -- with second quarter voluntary attrition at its lowest level in over five years.
Our earnings of $5.2 billion included $481 million net discrete income tax expense.
Our results also included $619 million of operating losses primarily related to non-litigation expense for previously disclosed matters, which I'll highlight in more detail in the next page.
We had a $479 million gain on the sale of $1.3 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans; $214 million of other-than-temporary impairment on the announced sale of Wells Fargo's Asset Management 65% ownership stake in The Rock Creek Group; and $150 million reserve release reflecting strong overall portfolio credit performance and lower balances.
In addition, as part of our efforts to make things right and rebuild trust, we've examined rates historically charged to FX customers over a seven-year period and set aside $140 million in the second quarter to rebate customers where historic pricing, while consistent with contracts entered into with those customers, doesn't conform to our recently implemented standards and pricing.
However, the asset cap related to the Federal Reserve's consent order has not impacted our ability to grow our core lending and deposit taking businesses.
The decline in loan balances was not related to any actions we took in connection with the consent order, but was driven by opportunistic loan sales and continued reductions in auto, consumer real estate and commercial real estate.
Commercial loans declined $291 million from the first quarter, despite C&I loans increasing $1.9 billion on growth in our Asset Backed Finance, Middle Market Banking and commercial capital business.
The growth was more than offset by continued declines in Commercial Real Estate, primarily due to lower originations reflecting continued credit discipline and competitive highly liquid financing markets as well as ongoing paydowns on existing and acquired loans.
Balances in student lending and personal loans and lines continued to decline, but originations of personal loans and lines were up 8% from a year ago and reached their highest level since the third quarter of 2016.
Average consumer and small business banking deposits declined $1.4 billion as higher average Community Banking deposits were more than offset by lower deposits in Wealth and Investment Management as customers allocated more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments.
Our average deposit cost increased six basis points from the first quarter and was up 19 basis points from a year ago compared with a 75 basis point change in the Fed funds rate.
The increase in our average deposit cost was driven by increases in commercial and Wealth and Investment Management deposit rates, while rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits have not yet meaningfully responded to rate movements.
Wholesale Banking deposits also declined due to seasonality and commercial customers allocating more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments.
The drivers of the increase included $120 million less negative impact from hedge ineffectiveness accounting; approximately $105 million from balance sheet mix, repricing and variable income, largely driven by the net impact of rates and spreads; and approximately $80 million from one additional day in the quarter.
While deposit service charges had minimal impact to linked-quarter trends, they were down 9% from a year ago, so I want to provide more insight into these fees.
I've highlighted in prior quarters the customer-friendly initiatives we've launched over the past year to help our consumer customers reduce fees, including Overdraft Rewind, which is an industry-leading feature that's helped over 1.3 million customers avoid overdraft charges.
As market interest rates have risen over the past year, the earnings credit rate on noninterest-bearing deposits has modestly reduced these fees for wholesale customers, which were down $25 million from a year ago.
Residential mortgage originations increased $7 billion from the first quarter, but revenue declined $102 million due to a lower production margin.
The production margin declined to 77 basis points as a result of increased pricing competition in both retail and correspondent channels.
Card fees increased $93 million from the first quarter on higher credit and debit card purchase volume.
Other fees increased $46 million and included higher Commercial Real Estate brokerage commissions.
Revenue-related expenses increased $59 million primarily from incentive compensation in Wells Fargo Securities and in home lending.
Compensation and benefits expense increased $265 million, primarily due to salary increases and higher severance, partially offset by the impact of the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, which drove FTE reductions in Wholesale Banking.
Both customer loyalty and overall satisfaction with most recent visit survey scores declined in the second quarter, which was driven by several factors, including recent events and a risk-based policy change affecting individuals making cash deposits into an account on which they're not a signer.
We had a $150 million reserve release, reflecting strong credit performance and lower loan balances.
Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
I will say that the -- where we are in the aggregate for fee income is part of what's driving us to get overall fixed expenses as low as they can possibly be, so a little bit different than Erika's question about revenue-related expense on the fee side.
But if fee income continues to be under pressure and not growing at an acceptable rate, we're going to go even deeper in core expenses.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.
Yes. I think the key for us is to make sure that we've got the right transition place -- in place, which Jon Weiss and David Kowach are very focused on, make sure that we've got -- we're continuing to develop the new FAs in the salary and bonus kind of business model structure and then making sure that we're continuing to invest on the digital side, Intuitive Investor is an example, so that the new demographic of investors has got additional options in addition to a real high-quality traditional FA model.
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
Yes. I don't think every dollar of a money market mutual fund would have stayed inside Wells Fargo.

wellsfargo,q3,2018,"Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions.
IÂm confident that these changes are building a better Wells Fargo for all of our stakeholders and we are encouraged by the positive business trends we had in the third quarter, including year-over-year growth in primary consumer checking customers, debit and credit card usage, loan originations in auto, small business, home equity and personal loans and lines.
We continued to have strong credit quality and high levels of liquidity and capital and we doubled our capital return compared with the third quarter last year, including a 10% increase in our common stock dividend.
Auto loans were down $1.6 billion from the second quarter due to expected continued run off and the transfer of the remaining $374 million of reliable financial services auto loans to held-for-sale.
Average deposits declined $40 billion from a year ago, reflecting lower wholesale banking deposits, including the actions taken in the first half of the year to manage to the asset gap as well as lower wealth and investment management deposits as customers allocated more cash to higher rate alternatives.
Wholesale banking deposits increased $9.1 billion in the third quarter with most of the growth coming later in the quarter after we made targeted adjustments to our pricing in a competitive rate environment.
Non-interest income increased $357 million from the second quarter with growth in other income, market sensitive revenue, mortgage banking, service charges on deposits and card fees.
Deposit service charges were up $41 million from the second quarter, primarily driven by seasonality and partially offset by a higher earnings credit rate for our commercial customers.
Mortgage banking revenue increased $76 million from the second quarter from higher net gains on residential and commercial mortgage loan originations.
We had declines in most of our expense categories on a linked quarter basis, including compensation and benefits, revenue related, running the business both discretionary and non-discretionary and third-party services.
Our positive business trends in the third quarter included growth in primary consumer checking customers, increased debit and credit card usage and higher loan originations in auto, small business, home equity and personal loans and lines which are all up from a year ago and we generated positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis.
We donÂt have a single solid number for 2020 in revenue for all the reasons that you can imagine in terms of where rates go, where industry loan growth, deposit growth and a variety of other things happen.
Some of them as we have talked about are on different cycles than others like mortgage, for example, where if that market is shrinking and if the industry gain on sale is as it is today, then the outcomes in the future will reflect the size of the market, our position in the market and what profitability looks like overall.
And now, you have seen that for two consecutive quarters and we reiterated that we think by the middle of next year, we will see growth in the overall portfolio.
I think the exciting thing about the auto business is not only are we seeing quarter, year-over-year and sequential quarter growth in loans, but we are doing it more efficiently, because about 40% of all the loans that we are originating are being originated on an automated basis in terms of credit decisioning as opposed to a manual basis.
As we think about the $50 billion to $51 billion for 2020 outside of the headcount trajectory that you have announced, is the 2020 target a result of something incremental that you had unearthed in terms of an expense opportunity or is it really just a continuation of the process improvement that you started a few years ago?
And I am going to ask this question another way, if revenues happen to be better than expected and the market is wrong about banks or at the top end of the range, is that $50 billion to $51 billion a firm dollar number to expect?
I mean, we have a really strong asset-backed finance business and we have seen good growth in that business for some of the reasons that you allude to which is that we have seen non-bank competition in a variety of forms continue to increase.
ItÂs in a little bit different form right now, because of some of the legacy non-bank competitors have gone away, gone out of business whatever, but the fundamental underwriting in that group is relatively short duration.
I think we have talked about this at the last conference that I spoke at, there is a distribution of consumer and commercial asset types, interesting most of which where we are deeply in the underlying business although sometimes these non-banks as where you started your question are competing in a way that we wouldnÂt directly.
ItÂs also a business that we can pursue on a pooled basis with a haircut after the fact, but you have got all manner of sovereign wealth funds and alternative asset managers and others who are aggressive in an unregulated way and doing things on a whole loan basis that a bank wonÂt do.
So, I think the fact that we have got very buoyant capital markets, very liquid capital markets and we have high credit quality for our customers means that loan growth is a little bit slower than we would have all imagined in an economic growth level that we are seeing right now.
ThatÂs how I think, I mean and by a little bit, itÂs close enough that plus or minus flat.
So, second question just on the mix of the balance sheet, we see that obviously with rising rates, your OCI is going up a little bit and this is a balance that I think you have talked about for a while now, John.
And I think we have been, while this backup is happening and not knowing exactly where itÂs going to end, I think we have been a little bit circumspect about incrementally moving from 2 and change percent on cash further out the curve.
John the only other point I would make in just Â and I know you know this, but I think any time we talk about loan growth is important to re-emphasize it.
So, there has been some impact from some of the reputation issues that we had, but I think the important thing is that you see in the overall numbers and performance this quarter, the improvement and us getting beyond some of those reputational issues.
Each quarter is going to have a story to it, but I think the important thing is that when you look Â if you look across the income statement, you are seeing more of our business, more of our products gross on a sequential quarter basis and year-over-year.
As John described, I think we are in a new world as it relates to home equity loans, but the fact that we saw growth across the consumer portfolio was actually good.
I donÂt think so, I mean itÂs impact at the end of the quarter we will be calling out at that time, I tend to discount that because itÂs uneconomic, itÂs really just a Â itÂs an accounting outcome thatÂs back to zero over the life of the hedge instruments and the hedge itself from the Â real fundamental of the business, the cash flow that we are generating I think deposit pricing is probably the biggest variable in the quarter.
And if you look at that line normalizing for non-core items, itÂs been kind of flat to down in recent quarters, can you just give us a sense of again whatÂs sort of in that number and how we should think about it on an ongoing basis and what a more normalized level or how we should think about modeling it would be?
The deeper we get into the markets that we are in, so the tighter credit spreads get, we have already seen rates move backup, it gets harder to generate those types of gains I would say, whether itÂs pre-crisis things that have been on the balance sheet for 10 years that were marked a certain way or appreciated investments that we have made over the last 10 years.
Good morning, can you guys share with us you talked John, a bit about raising some deposit rates in the wholesale business enables you to grow that deposits at the end of the quarter, can you share with us what that might do for the fourth quarter in terms of deposit growth in that area and also the net interest margin?
And then coming to the asset side of the balance sheet, when you talk about your commercial and industrial loan portfolio, I think in the second quarter, you indicated that the loans to non-depository financials was about $94.5 billion, what did that grow to in the third quarter?
So, I wouldnÂt want you to Â it is a weighted average, but it hasnÂt changed in at least the last couple of years as I have looked at the quarter to quarter information which incidentally when we think about the demand for credit, I generally expect that customers use available revolving facilities before negotiating and paying for new incremental available credit and we havenÂt seen much of that.
So, Nancy, the way that we think about the mortgage business today is that we have got to be able to improve our results based upon the environment that we are in.
So, I think what you are going to see is a continued improvement in the efficiency of that business, assuming that we are in overall, but particularly in an environment that we are in right now.
Well, itÂs right-sized for today, but our expectation not only for mortgage, but for all of our business and this gets back to JohnÂs comments about how we think about efficiency and expenses is what can we do to improve the returns to the business?
And maybe, particularly, as we become a bigger credit card bank, weÂll be even a little bit more incrementally exposed to that, but that part of the business, thatÂs a growth risk for banks like Wells Fargo.
I know itÂs still a headwind to loan growth overall, but for the pay-downs specifically, was that an acceleration from the previous quarter or did it decelerate and whatÂs your expectations going forward?
But I think we mentioned earlier, new accounts in general purpose credit card, including Propel were up 27% linked quarter and 17% year-over-year which is good momentum.
And thatÂs really, Brian, one of the reasons why we are being somewhat conservative in providing a lot of details because when you think about the business model and returns for that card, you got to see all the additional metrics that John is describing.
In addition, our retail customers continue to benefit from consumer-friendly initiatives we implemented last year, including overdraft rewind which has helped over 1.8 million customers avoid overdraft charges.
While this latest change does not have a material impact on our deposit service charges since the monthly fees were minimal, it does encourage younger customers to join and stay with Wells Fargo.
We also recently launched Control Tower, which provides customers with a single view of their digital financial footprint, including where their Wells Fargo debit or credit card or account information is connected such as with recurring payments.
We are committed to working with organizations and agencies on the ground to help our communities recover and providing continued assistance to our team members and customers, who have been impacted including reversing certain fees and allocating $3 million to our WE Care Fund, which provides grants to team members who faced a catastrophic disaster or financial hardship resulting from an event beyond their control.
We also want to be an industry leader in team member engagement and our efforts to make Wells Fargo a better place to work are reflected in continued low voluntary team member attrition.
We returned a record $8.9 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the third quarter, more than double the amount returned a year ago.
As Tim highlighted, we had positive business momentum including primary consumer checking customers up 1.7% from a year ago, increased debit and credit card usage with debit card purchase volume up 9%, and consumer general purpose credit card purchase volume up 7% from a year ago, and higher loan originations with auto up 10%, small business up 28%, home equity up 16%, and personal loans and lines up 3% from a year ago.
Our earnings were $6 billion included a $638 million gain on the sale of $1.7 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans, $605 million of operating losses primarily related to remediation expense for a variety of matters including an additional $241 million accruals of previously disclosed issues related to automobile collateral and protection insurance, $100 million reserve release reflecting strong credit performance as well as lower loan balances.
And an effective income tax rate of 20.1% which included net discrete income tax expense related to the re-measurement of our initial estimates for the impacts of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act recognized in the fourth quarter.
Revenue growth included the increase in net interest income as higher NIM offset lower earning assets, expenses declined driven by lower operating losses, however we also had lower expenses in a number of other categories including outside professional services, outside data processing and travel and entertainment.
Strong credit performance as well as lower loan balances resulted in lower provision expense and our capital levels remained strong while we increased our share buyback and reduced common shares outstanding by 4%.
The decline in average loan balances was driven by strategic loan sales, continued reductions in commercial real estate reflecting our conservative underwriting, declines in auto as we have transformed that business and run off of legacy junior lean mortgage loans.
Commercial loans declined $1.2 billion from the second quarter despite C&I loans increasing $1.5 billion with growth in corporate and investment banking, commercial capital and commercial real estate credit facilities through REITs and non-depository financial institutions.
The decline in CRE mortgage loans was due to ongoing pay-downs on existing and acquired loans as well as lower originations reflecting continued credit discipline in competitive and highly liquid financing markets.
Junior lean mortgage loans continued to decline as pay downs more than offset new originations which grew 3% from the second quarter and 16% from a year ago.
New accounts grew 27% from the second quarter benefiting from the launch of the new Propel card which exceeded our expectations and higher originations through digital channels which generated 45% of all new credit card accounts.
Auto originations increased 8% from the second quarter and 10% from a year ago with high quality origination growth driven by changes related to the business which makes it easier for customers to do business with us including increased automated underwriting.
The $4.9 billion decline in average deposits from the second quarter was driven by lower consumer and small business banking deposits, which includes wealth and investment management deposits as consumers continue to move excess liquidity to higher rate alternatives.
Our average deposit cost increased 7 basis points from the second quarter and was up 21 basis points from a year ago compared with the 100 basis point change in the Fed Funds rate.
Consumer and small business banking deposits declined $13.7 billion from the second quarter driven by customers in wealth and investment management and community banking moving excess liquidity to higher rate alternatives which was partially offset by modest growth in small business banking deposits.
Trust and investment fees declined $44 million from the second quarter on lower investment banking results and lower retail brokerage transaction activity.
While residential mortgage loan originations declined $4 billion from the second quarter, their production margin increased to 97 basis points primarily due to an improvement in secondary market conditions.
Given our commitment to improving efficiency, the transformational changes we are making across our businesses as well as our changing customer preferences, including adoption of digital self-service capabilities, we recently announced that we expect our headcount to decline by approximately 5% to 10% within the next 3 years as part of achieving our expense targets.
These higher expenses were partially offset by the impact of the sale of Wells Fargo insurance services and lower FTEs as part of our efficiency initiative.
While we have more work to do, our efforts to improve efficiency are already being reflected in areas such as outside professional services, outside data processing, T&E, postage and supplies and we currently expect that we will meet our 2018 expense target.
Turning to our segments starting on Page 17, community banking earnings increased $320 million from the second quarter driven by lower net discrete income tax expense.
Turning to Page 20, wholesale banking earnings increased $216 million from the second quarter reflecting lower operating losses and higher revenue.
Results from the third quarter also reflected lower operating losses.
The reduction in RWA included a one-time impact from our implementation of the newly issued regulatory guidance covering high volatility commercial real estate, which benefited our CET1 ratio by approximately 10 basis points.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler OÂNeill & Partners.
I had another question commercial loan growth across the industry hasnÂt quite matched what we had hoped as we thought about GDP and CapEx expectations.
I think I would also say on home equity, I would be surprised if Â more than surprised if we ever end up with the same percentage of our balance sheet in second lien mortgage paper versus where we were both Wells Fargo alone pre-crisis and then the combination of Wells and Wachovia right after the merger.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
Yes. We have got some types of wholesale customers who are sitting on lots of excess liquidity and itÂs up to them everyday to think about whether they move it from one bank to another and those deposits incidentally have their own LCR liquidity rating and liquidity value or run off factors that we think about those in a certain way.
Our final question will come from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
",39.23,0.72643197
wellsfargo,q4,2018,"[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations.
Our voluntary team member attrition improved to its lowest level in six years in 2018 and we continued to attract new team members from outside the company including our most recently announced Head of Technology Saul Van Beurden, who will join us and join our operating committee and will report to me in April.
Three, increasing card usage with debit card purchase volume up 8% and consumer general purpose credit card purchase volume up 5% from a year ago; four, growing loan originations year-over-year in auto by 9%, home equity by 14%, small business by 19% and student lending by 16%.
On page six, IÂd like to highlight that our 2013 full year effective income tax rate was 20.2% or 18% before discrete items.
This growth was broad based across a number of our wholesale businesses and was largely to investment grade, corporate credits and high quality middle market borrowers.
Credit card loans increased $1.2 billion from the third quarter driven by seasonality as well as growth in active accounts including the Propel card.
While the change in balance sheet mix negatively impacted net interest income, it also reflected an increasing proportion of higher quality lower risk loans on the balance sheet.
WeÂve made significant changes in how weÂre running many of our consumer and wholesale businesses, including streamlining the retail mortgage sales organization, eliminating layers and reengineering the mortgage fulfillment process, which reduce home lending headcount by 5000 in 2018.
As Tim highlighted at the start of the call, both customer loyalty and overall satisfaction with the most recent visit branch survey scores reached a 24-month high in December with steady improvement over the past six months.
Turning to Page 26, our CET1 ratio fully faced phased-in declined 20 basis points from the third quarter due to common stock dividends and net share repurchases, but it remained well above regulatory minimums and is aligned with our plan of prudently managing toward our internal target of 10%.
While we were pleased to return $25.8 billion to shareholders in 2018 our CET1 ratio was down only 30 basis points from a year ago as RWA improvements, including the regulatory guidance covering high volatility commercial real estate, as well as declines in RWA from changes in balance sheet mix to lower risk assets benefited our capital position.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
Both really good questions Erika, and thanks Erika.
ItÂs just happening a little bit slower than we had originally anticipated, but weÂll get there.
Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
Going from 11.7 down to 10, are you already kind of mentally at least got an estimate that says okay, we have to reallocate a certain amount from this accounting principle, or how would you think about that between the 170 [ph] points between those two numbers?
Yes actually, thereÂs been a couple of opportunities over the last year as CECLÂs been coming into clearer focus as well as the what the stress capital buffer will mean when itÂs fully implemented.
IÂm not sure if thatÂs 10.25, or 10.375 [ph] or whatever the right number is.
Your next question comes from the line of Matthew OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
Yes. ItÂs a little tricky, because our bread and butter middle market customer often gets tagged under leveraged lending guidance as the leverage loan even though it doesnÂt exhibit the same either leverage characteristics or structural or governance or other characteristics of a -- of a sponsor owned LBO borrower.
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.
I donÂt think thereÂs that many and certainly not on NVP and not even that many deals on any NEP side where things are getting sold to people who require high yield financing in order to make it work know like another sponsor for example itÂs more often that they're selling something to a strategic whoÂs got their other sources of financing.
We would expect if capacity comes out of the system because smaller players are less efficient players are not making any money then there would be a IÂm not sure if itÂs a return to what gains used to be that people in the industry that seem to believe that thinks you know snap back to some equilibrium level over and over again but this could be different.
Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
I was hoping you can maybe update us on whether that 60 to 70 basis points are still the appropriate through the cycle level youÂre thinking about.
Yes. So if you zeroed out net recovery, you probably end up a few basis points higher than the recent run rate.
Your next question will come from the line up of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions.
We believe that we can achieve both of these priorities, while we operate under the asset cap and our growth in both loans and deposits in the fourth quarter demonstrated our ability to do so.
The settlements weÂve reached last year and the remediation we provided to customers reflects important progress on our goal to move Wells Fargo forward as quickly as possible, while continuing to provide our customers with high quality service, and advice each and every day.
In 2019, we will continue to build the most customer focused, efficient and innovative Wells Fargo ever, characterized by a strong financial foundation, a leading presence in markets we serve, focused growth within a strong risk management framework, operational excellence, and highly engaged team members.
And we had positive business momentum, including one, growing loans in deposits on both an average and period and basis from the third quarter; two, increasing primary consumer checking customers by 1.2% from a year ago net of the previously disclosed sale of 52 branches that closed in the fourth quarter, reducing this growth rate by 0.5%.
Our earnings of $6.1 billion included a $614 million gain on the sale of $.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans, $432 million of operating losses, which included $175 million accrual for the agreement reached in December with all 50 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia regarding previously disclosed consumer matters, a $372 million adjustment, negative net MSR valuation adjustment for servicing and foreclosure costs, discount rates and prepayment estimates recognized as a result of recent market observations related to an acceleration of prepayments, including for VA loans and market participants current valuation of MSRs. These adjustments were not related to our ongoing interest rate hedging, and so hedging program performed as intended to protect against interest rate changes in the fourth quarter.
A $200 million reserve release reflecting continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio, and while it didnÂt impact our earnings, deferred compensation, which is impacted by equity market pricing reduced fees by $452 million and reduced expenses by $428 million in the fourth quarter.
We highlight our full year results on page four, compared with 2017, revenues declined from lower fee income, primarily driven by $1.3 billion decline in mortgage banking, primarily due to lower gains on mortgage originations, a $620 million decline in insurance reflecting the sale of Wells Fargo insurance services, and $395 million decline in deposit service charges driven by the customer friendly changes weÂve implemented, which have reduced fees, together with a higher ECR for commercial customers.
We continued to have strong credit performance due to a number of factors including the efforts to de-risk the loan portfolio by running off or selling higher risk consumer loans while growing higher quality assets.
Average loans increased $6.8 billion from the third quarter, the first linked quarter increase since fourth quarter of 2016 with growth in the commercial portfolio partially offset by continued declines in consumer specifically auto and home equity.
Period end loans increased $10.8 billion from the third quarter, but were down $3.7 billion from a year ago, as we sold or transferred to held for sale $8.4 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans and reliable financial services loans in 2018.
Commercial real estate loans were down $583 million from the third quarter and it declined for seven consecutive quarters, reflecting continued credit discipline and competitive in the highly liquid markets and pay downs of existing and acquired loans.
As we show on page nine, consumer loans declined $709 million from the third quarter and included the sale of $1.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans in the fourth quarter.
Due to the sale of reliable, auto originations were down 1% from the third quarter, but they were up 9% from a year ago, reflecting our focus on growing high quality auto loans following the transformational changes we made to the business.
Average deposits declined $42.7 billion from a year ago reflecting both lower wholesale banking deposits, including actions taken in the first half of the year to manage to the asset gap and lower wealth and investment management deposits as customers allocated more cash to higher rate alternatives.
Wealth and investment management deposits increased for the first time in three quarters, driven by higher retail brokerage sweep deposits, and private banking deposits partially reflecting our customers change in risk appetite given market volatility at the end of the quarter.
Net interest income increased $72 million from the third quarter, driven primarily by the benefits of higher average interest rates and favorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, partially offset by the impacts from balance sheet mix and lower variable income.
Non-interest income declined $1 billion from the third quarter, driven by lower market sensitive revenue, mortgage banking fees, interest and investment fees partially offset by higher other income which included $117 million gain from the sale of 52 branches.
Mortgage banking revenue declined $379 million from the third quarter as a result of lower servicing income, and lower net gains on mortgage loans, originations and sales.
Our work will continue during this year, which is expected to result in additional cost savings as well as reduced customer transfers and wait times.
Turning to our business segment starting on page 20, community banking earnings increased $353 million from the third quarter, driven by lower operating losses and income tax expense.
Turning to page 23, wholesale banking earnings declined $180 million from the third quarter driven by lower trading gains, investment banking fees and other income, which was partially, offset by higher loan fees and commercial real estate brokerage commissions.
Volatility in the equity markets during the fourth quarter impacted results, but helped to drive period end deposit growth.
However, we continued to have strong credit results with a net charge-off rate of 30 basis points in the fourth quarter.
For the fifth consecutive quarter, all of our commercial and consumer real estate loan portfolios were in a net recovery position and non-performing assets declined $280 million or 4% from the third quarter and were down 16% from a year ago.
So, in summary, in 2019 we plan to continue focusing on transforming Wells Fargo into a better bag, by improving risk management and customer service making Wells Fargo a great place to work, launching industry leading innovation, contributing to our communities and creating long term shareholder value.
But at the same time, weÂre continuing to actively work and implement the new risk management framework, as I mentioned, we detailed that in our third quarter 10-Q and as well as incorporating the input that weÂre getting back from the Fed along the way.
But, to your second question, I think the fourth quarter results reinforce our ability particularly when you look at loan growth, and you net out the impact of the legacy loan portfolios for example, in Pick-a-Pay from the asset sales or the decline in pre 2009 home equity portfolio.
And we want to reiterate today, and I hope you appreciated hearing that from both John and me, and IÂll say it a third time that our goal is to hit and achieve the expense targets that we provided you not only for this year, but through 2020.
We saw great loan growth in the fourth quarter some of that I think was either seasonal or reflecting what was going on in markets in the fourth quarter, which caused people to turn to their banks even more than they otherwise would have.
And I guess, at the current level of deposit beta, do you see a modest benefit still from a hike, and then, you know if you donÂt see a hike, is it really just come down to the loan growth and what we know in a quarter where thereÂs no rate hike, does NIM kind of trend flattish?
And then as I mentioned to Erika donÂt just kind of the importance of whatÂs going on with loan rates, because the curve has been flattening well, short rates have been coming up especially in the fourth quarter when we -- when we came crashing down well below 3%, and that really contributes on all of this incremental liquidity that keeps getting reinvested.
But, but I think, it has more to do with what happens with the general level of asset credit of loan growth and what happens to deposit pricing.
Our ability to provide good service to grow the number of primary checking account relationships our ability to grow loans, and as John pointed out, the lessening impact of the legacy portfolios or for example the credit decisions and the transformation that we made in our auto business, which John pointed out itÂs -- it's what we donÂt control, which is where the short end of the curve is going to be and the long end of the curve, and what the slope is going to be that is more of a question mark.
At the moment in business as usual, the impact of CECL would not require any massive reallocation of our capital, it may cause us to think a little bit differently about loan structures or loan pricing for certain types of particularly longer dated things, and maybe even more particularly on the consumer side.
On the loan growth side I just want to see regarding the fourth quarter trends, wanted to get a little bit more color on how youÂre thinking about how much of that fourth quarter strength in growth is possibly transient given the moves in the bond markets and everything versus whatÂs sticky, and what here can really gain?
It means that we sometimes, we miss some of the highs, but weÂre absolutely there for the lows, for our customers just like in the quarter when the capital markets seized up, we were there providing credit to all of our customers that needed it.
I mean, donÂt forget weÂve got a $950 billion loan portfolio and anyone credit is not going to drive the results of the company.
So I think itÂs harder to imagine it gapping upward, itÂs easy to imagine it gapping downwards, but itÂll always Â itÂs always been an adjustment that we, that we end up talking about, to the extent that it becomes the swing item in the quarter or for the year that weÂre pointing to say, but for that we would have hit our target or we wonÂt, we certainly wonÂt take credit for what you did, what we all know as a P&L neutral outcome to achieve a goal that is designed to be achieved the hard way, which is by managing expenses.
So given the environment weÂre in, as John mentioned in his comments, weÂve got to continue to grow our share with our customer base by providing better service, which their folks are really focused on.
And when this cycle does end, those are the loans that are probably going to have a higher default rate, and to the extent that we can find the right, the right buyer for those at prices that makes sense that will de-risk us from an operational risk perspective when that time comes, because there will be more will be more defaults.
I recognize it was a very tough quarter in terms of some of the market sensitive businesses and you spoke of some of the growth areas within 2019, whether it be mortgage release income, but because you have some of those headwinds in the wealth side as well that you noted you told me you can maybe frame, whatÂs the right jumping off point for the fee income to start the year?
Well thatÂs an excellent question, but the jump -- the stepping off point is the some of the stories in each of the lines and we really donÂt sort of wrap that up and put a single growth rate on it because thereÂs so many things that are driven by different forces, whether itÂs, as you said the S&P in the case of certain fee income lines, whatÂs going on, in the mortgage market, what are competitive positioning is?

wellsfargo,q1,2019,"Thank you for joining our call today where our interim CEO and President, Allen Parker; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions.
Since assuming my new role, I've been focused on leading our Company forward by emphasizing my top priorities, serving our customers and supporting our Wells Fargo team members, meeting and exceeding the expectations of our regulators and continuing the important transformation of the Company.
We continue to strengthen Wells Fargo's leadership team with both internal promotions and external hires, including our Head of Technology, Saul Van Beurden who joined Wells Fargo earlier this week as a member of our operating committee.
In addition to these ongoing leadership changes, we're also realigning our business structure and making significant investments in key capabilities that taken together will help ensure that we meet the expectations of our regulators.
Simply put, we are engaged in a transformative effort with the goal of building the most customer-focused, efficient and innovative Wells Fargo ever, a premier financial institution characterized by a strong financial foundation, a leading presence in our chosen markets, focused growth within a responsible risk management framework, operational excellence and highly engaged team members.
So, let me just mention here that we adopted the new lease accounting standard in the first quarter, which had no meaningful impact on our P&L, but requires operating leases to be recognized now on the balance sheet as the right of use asset, increasing our other assets by $4.9 billion.
Page six, revenue grew 3% from the fourth quarter as lower net interest income was more than offset by growth in non-interest income, and I'll highlight the fee income drivers later on the call.
I'll highlight the driver of the linked quarter decline in period-end loans starting on page eight.
Our growth in the first quarter reflected our continued credit discipline and high-quality loan originations as well as less runoff of previously purchased loan portfolios.
Partially offsetting this decline was $4.2 billion of high-quality nonconforming loan growth, which excludes another $776 million that were designated as held for sale in anticipation of future securitizations.
Credit card loans declined $746 million from the fourth quarter, driven by expected seasonality.
Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $961 million from the fourth quarter on lower margin loans and other securities based lending, reflecting higher short-term rates as well as market volatility.
Average deposits declined $35.1 billion from a year ago, reflecting both lower wholesale banking deposits including actions taken in the first half of last year to manage to the asset cap, and lower wealth and investment management deposits as customers allocated more cash to higher-yielding liquid alternatives.
Average deposits declined $6.8 billion from the fourth quarter as lower wholesale banking deposits, driven by seasonality, were partially offset by higher consumer and small business banking deposits.
On average, deposit costs increased 10 basis points from the fourth quarter and 31 basis points from a year-ago, driven primarily by increases in wholesale and WIM deposit rates.
The cumulative one-year beta has increased to 43%, up from 38% last quarter, reflecting continued pricing competition across major deposit categories.
Wholesale banking deposits were down $37 billion from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting seasonality from typically higher fourth quarter levels.
Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $9.4 billion from higher retail banking deposits reflecting seasonality, as well as growth in CDs and high-yield savings.
Several factors have driven shifts in our view, including a lower absolute rate outlook, a flatter curve, tightening loan spreads resulting from a competitive market with ample liquidity and continued upward pressure on deposit pricing.
Net gains from trading activities rebounded from a weaker fourth quarter, increasing $347 million, driven primarily by strength in credit and asset-backed products.
Mortgage originations decline $5 billion from the fourth quarter, primarily due to expected seasonality, while the production margin increased to 105 basis points, primarily due to improvement in secondary market conditions.
We expect to see higher origination volume in the second quarter due to typical seasonality for home buying as well as some additional refinance activity resulting from the recent decrease and mortgage interest rates.
Trust and investment fees declined $147 million from the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower asset-based fees on retail brokerage advisory assets, reflecting lower market valuations on December 31st, which is when these assets were priced for first quarter revenue purposes.
These seasonally higher personnel expenses should decline in the second quarter, but salary expense is expected to grow, reflecting increases which became effective late in the first quarter as well as an additional payroll day in the second quarter.
Running the business nondiscretionary expense declined $580 million, primarily from lower core deposit and other intangibles as the 10-year amortization period on the Wachovia-related intangibles ended, and also from lower operating losses.
As a result, our actual and anticipated investment spend for 2018 through 2019 has increased by $1.4 billion from our expectations at our 2018 investor day.
The major categories of savings are from centralization and optimization, including staff function rationalization and advancing our contact center of the future, running the business, which includes streamlining our mortgage operations and restructuring our wholesale banking business as examples and governance and controls overspending, which is expected to further reduce third-party services spend and includes a consistent approach to manage our spans of control and hiring location guidelines for noncustomer facing team members.
Community banking earnings decreased $346 million from the fourth quarter, driven by seasonally higher personnel expense.
Wealth and investment management earnings declined $112 million from the fourth quarter, driven by lower asset-based fees, reflecting the lower 12/31 market valuations, which was when retail brokerage advisory assets were priced.
As Allen highlighted, earlier this week, we announced an agreement to sell our institutional retirement and trust business, which reflects our strategy by focusing our resources on areas where we believe we can grow and maximize our opportunities within wealth brokerage and asset management.
Our CET1 ratio fully phased in, increased 20 basis points from the fourth quarter as continued strong returns of capital even with seasonally higher share issuance in the first quarter were more than offset by capital generation from earnings, improved cumulative OCI and lower risk-weighted assets.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Yes, in part, I think because a lot our recent retail deposit gathering has been higher costs than historically.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
But, as I think about the dynamics of capital return and opportunities to continue to restructure the firm, so as of year-end 2018, Wells Fargo had 2,595 more employees than JP Morgan, and your employee base declined just 3% since 2009 and you have peer banks in the United States that have 50,000 less employees than do for larger asset bases.
Does that NII outlook -- does it assume any ongoing reinvestment of your excess liquidity position because I would assume that, if you do continue to use that to fund new loan originations, it could help temper the impact of the expectation that you're seeing on the deposit costs side?
This morning, I'll outline the actions I'm taking together with our leadership team to continue to transform Wells Fargo and to get that transformation right for all our stakeholders, including our customers, our team members, our shareholders and our regulators.
The team and I are committed to addressing these mistakes of the past, and over the coming weeks and months I plan to spend much of my time listening to our customers and working to understand how we can best serve them.
This team, which sits outside our lines of business, establishes our Companywide remediation policies, sets standards and coordinates with our lines of business in the day-to-day management of remediation efforts and provides our Board of Directors, our regulators and our senior management with comprehensive information about all customer remediation efforts that we are taking place at Wells Fargo.
While we're aggressively addressing our risk and control issues and building a better bank, I want to acknowledge clearly that we have a substantial amount of work yet to do, both to satisfy the expectations of our regulators and even more important, to create the financial institution we aspire to be.
But regardless of the status of the progress of any particular part of the necessary work, I want to make clear that the most important thing for our Company is that and our ongoing constructive engagement with the Federal Reserve.
We understand the seriousness of getting our work with the Federal Reserve right, and we are therefore making and will be willing to make the investments that are necessary to complete the work that's needed to improve our compliance and operational risk capabilities.
This work is fundamentally an evolution of our business model, and this evolution will both change how we manage compliance and operational risk, and by simplifying and strengthening our business processes help us serve our customers better and become more efficient, all of which will benefit our shareholders over the long term.
As you know, weÂre currently operating well below the asset cap, and we have had and will continue to have the ability to serve the needs of all our 700 million customers -- excuse me, 70 million customers, while we work to satisfy the requirements of the Federal Reserve consent order.
The work we're doing in conjunction with our regulators to improve operational effectiveness will make Wells Fargo a more simple and nimble company while at the same time bringing us closer to our customers, which is the real reason we're here.
Compared with the first quarter of Â18, revenue declined 1%, primarily driven by lower trust and investment fees, and mortgage banking fees, partially offset by 1% growth in net interest income.
Average loans increased $3.8 billion from the fourth quarter, the second consecutive linked quarter increase with growth in the commercial portfolio, partially offset by continued declines in the consumer portfolio.
Period-end loans increased $941 million from a year-ago, with growth in high-quality non-conforming first mortgage loans, C&I loans and credit card loans, largely offset by $6.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage and reliable consumer auto loan sales since the second quarter of 2018.
The first mortgage portfolio declined $520 million from the fourth quarter, driven by the sale of $1.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans.
We increased our auto origination market share with high-quality originations, and we currently expect our auto loan -- our auto portfolio balances to grow by midyear and as early as the second quarter.
Noninterest income increased $962 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher market sensitive revenue and mortgage banking fees.
Turning to page 24, wholesale banking earnings increased $99 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher market sensitive revenue and lower non-interest expense.
We continued to have strong credit results with a net charge-off rate of 30 basis points in the first quarter and net charge-offs down $26 million from the fourth quarter, driven by seasonally lower auto and other revolving credit and installment loan losses.
So, in summary, our first quarter results continue to reflect strong customer activity and some underlying positive business momentum, and we're on track to achieve our 2019 expense target.
And if deposit prices continue to lag and catch up to the historic beta, maybe things are a little bit stronger until later in the year, if that that catch-up takes until later in the year.
I would like to understand how the organization is thinking through those two things in the context of the question.
The most important thing, though, I think from my perspective is for everybody to understand that while the search is underway, the Company is going to continue to move forward assertively and decisively on the priorities that John and I have discussed this morning.
So, I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about the mortgage business that you run and how you deal with that, especially on the sourcing component.
And Betsy, with respect to your point about the mortgage business, and as you described the regulatory arbitrage, I would say that weÂre -- mortgage lending is core to Wells Fargo, it's very important to our customers.
We've changed the business over the last couple of years to take some of the extra contractual risks out of the origination and the servicing side of things and to try and make it as tolerable as possible in the complex environment that we're operating in.
The way we approach CCAR is starting with the feedback that we get in the prior year and working all year to improve our approach, which includes our operational risk identification, control identification, our scenario designed to impact those types of things, the impact more broadly on what it means both for PPNR generation.
I think, the work that's happening right now, which is frankly the underpinning a lot of the regulatory related requirements around operational risk and compliance is business process by business process, end to end understanding of how everything gets done at Wells Fargo in a very encyclopedic way.
But in the short-term as we're adding in places like the control functions and the businesses, and Mandy's team broadly in the second line of defense for risk and compliance, those will definitely be -- those will push numbers up in the short term.
We've had this discussion before that at the end of this process that for a company of our size relative to peers that you're mentioning, we have a lower risk mix of businesses.
And as we think about the timing of when you put out that guidance, earlier guidance on NII at the Credit Suisse conference, obviously the yield curve flattened, but is your sensitivity to the long end that material that this magnitude of change is not just significant relative to your old guide but also significant relative to peers?
So, on the long end, I would say that we have got more conviction that we're going to be reinvesting at lower rates for more of the year than moving with through the big rally in connection with the disruption of the fourth quarter.
And if that doesn't happen, as I mentioned to John, thatÂs going to be upside or I should say, move us higher in the range of possible outcomes for this year.
On the fee side, and I donÂt mean to be cheeky at all but excluding the idiosyncratic gains on Pick-a-Pay end and the payroll services company, John, what would you call core fees for the year -- sorry, for the quarter?
I guess, IÂd point to mortgage probably as this year rolls through and given where the pipeline sits and the fact that we're up a little bit higher in terms of gain on sale, and servicing frankly feels a little bit more stable compared to Q4.
I mean, I don't know if it's just that the regulators don't appreciate how big, how granular, how diverse a company you are, so, how long it takes or if it's just been maybe bigger issues than you appreciated a year ago.
I think, one of the most important things to understand is that what we're talking about, as I said earlier is essentially an evolution of our business model.
We have in essence picked out with our regulators a point on the horizon in terms of creating a truly extraordinary company, not only in terms of business performance and operational excellence, but also risk management.
The single most important thing I think to note is that we have really done a good job of restructuring our balance sheet so as to be able to operate under the asset cap for over a year.
Again, I think we've captured that in our outlook, but those trade-offs are being assessed every day because as you could -- at this point in time, with all of the -- the possibilities of what technology can bring to the businesses, there are -- there's a boundless list of things that we'd all like to do.
Obviously, Chris, as you know, we're -- when you talk about consent orders, we're looking at a number of different ones and some of them are in more focused areas in terms of our businesses and our operations.
With regard to the other parts of what we're doing, those things really focused on operational risk and compliance and I think just going back to your question, Chris, it's a combination.
I think it cannot be described as something that's being done on a whiteboard because there are number of reference points, but I would say, if anything, we are all trying to achieve something that maybe almost an outer boundary in terms of the quality of operational risk and compliance, something that hasn't really been achieved at this level before.
If there were other interesting things for us to invest in, whether it was loans or securities we'd do it, but on the securities front, I think given where we are in terms of yield of risk free rates and spreads, we've accounted for what is within our appetite and on the loan front, as I've mentioned before, we're competing vigorously in every market that we're enthusiastic about to grow loans.
I mean, this has been a very critical issue for the Company and it's been something that I think the management has been talking about for since the beginning.
The changes that Jon Weiss is making in running that business I think will continue to generate a high level of value creation.

wellsfargo,q2,2019,"Branch customer experience survey scores have now increased for four consecutive quarters and in June, reached their highest levels in over three years.
Reflecting our deep management team Mary Katherine DuBose, who joined Wells Fargo in 1998 and was most recently a leader in wholesale banking, has assumed the role of Chief Credit Officer and Jeremy Smith will lead market and counterparty risk.
My final top priority is continuing the important transformation of Wells Fargo so that we can build on our already strong foundation to become even more customer focused, innovative and better positioned for the future.
Our net charge-offs remained near historic lows at 28 basis points and our $150 million reserve release in the second quarter was the same amount as a year ago.
Period-end loans increased $5.6 billion from a year ago with growth in first mortgage, C&I and credit card loans partially offset by declines in junior lien mortgage loans as well as commercial real estate loans.
Commercial real estate loans increased $105 million from the first quarter, the second consecutive linked quarter increase, as growth in mortgage lending was partially offset by runoff of construction loans reflecting cyclicality of commercial real estate construction projects and our continued credit discipline.
Turning to deposits on page 11, average deposits declined $2.3 billion from a year ago as wealth and investment management and wholesale banking customers continue to allocate more cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives.
Our deposit beta reflects current market conditions, including repricing lags from prior Fed Funds rate increases and deposit campaigns for new retail deposits, which have resulted in a greater percentage of higher yielding promotional deposit balances.
Wholesale banking deposits were up $37.4 billion from the first quarter with growth in corporate and investment banking, commercial real estate and corporate trust and also included an elevated level of large short-term deposit inflows.
Consumer and small business banking deposits declined $12 billion driven by lower wealth and investment management deposits from the seasonality of tax payments, as well as clients continuing to reallocate cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives.
And in the second quarter, we send an average of more than 38 million zero balance and customer specific alerts a month and helped over 1 million customers avoid overdraft charges through overdraft rewind.
Residential held for sale mortgage loan originations totaled $33 billion in the second quarter, and the production margin on these originations declined to 98 basis points, down 7 basis points due to sales execution timing.
New consumer checking customers acquired through the digital channel were up 45% from a year ago and 48% of new general purpose credit card accounts were originated through the digital channel in the second quarter.

Let me close by thanking all of you for joining the second quarter conference call.
Thank you for joining our call today where our Interim CEO and President, Allen Parker; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions.
And thanks for joining us for today's discussion of our second quarter results, which included strong quarterly earnings.
On our call last quarter, I outlined my three top priorities for Wells Fargo, which are focusing on our customers and team members; meeting the expectations of our regulators, and continuing our company's important transformation.
And by continuing to meet our wholesale banking customersÂ needs for asset-based financing during the quarter, we increased our industry leading market share in these financings.
Now with most of these transformational changes complete, our auto portfolio returned to growth in the second quarter for the first time since 2016 and in line with our expectations.
On the next page, we summarize noteworthy items in the second quarter, including a $721 million gain on the sale of $1.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans.
The remaining balance in the Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio was $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter, down from $8.8 billion a year ago, reflecting portfolio sales and runoff.
We highlight some year-over-year results on page four, compared with the second quarter 2018 revenue was stable with an increase of $477 million in noninterest income largely offset by a $446 million decline in net interest income.
The average loan yield was up 16 basis points from a year ago from the repricing impacts of higher interest rates, and it declined 4 basis points from the first quarter due to changes in loan mix and the repricing impact of lower interest rates.
IÂll highlight the drivers of the $1.6 billion linked quarter increase in period-end loans starting on page nine.
Commercial loans increased $19 million from the first quarter, C&I loans were down $288 million, as growth in our credit investment portfolio from purchasing CLOs in loan form was offset by declines in commercial capital, corporate and investment banking and commercial real estate credit facilities to REITs and non-depository financial institutions.
38% of our total mortgage originations in the second quarter were held for investment, which was up from 26% a year ago.
Average deposits increased $6.9 billion from the first quarter driven by higher retail banking deposits, reflecting increased promotional activity, partially offset by lower wealth and investment management deposits.
Our average deposit costs of 70 basis points increased 5 basis points from the first quarter and 30 basis points from a year ago, reflecting higher deposit rates in wholesale banking and wealth and investment management, deposit mix shifts as customers allocated more balances to higher yielding categories, and retail banking deposit campaign pricing for new deposits.
If the Fed Funds rate remains at current levels, we expect our cumulative through the cycle beta to continue to trend upward albeit at the lower end of our previously guided range of 45% to 55%.
On page 13, we provide details on period end deposits, which increased $24.4 billion from the first quarter.
Net interest income decreased $216 million from the first quarter, driven by balance sheet mix and repricing including the impact of higher deposit costs and lower interest rate environment, as well as $73 million from increased premium amortization costs from higher MBS prepayments.
Net interest income was down 4% in the second quarter and down 2% in the first half of 2019, compared with the same periods a year ago.
Last quarter, we said we expected net interest income to decline 2% to 5% this year compared with 2018.
Turning to page 15, noninterest income increased $191 million from the first quarter, with broad base growth including higher trust and investment fees, other income, service charges on deposit accounts, card fees and mortgage banking.
We expected deposit service charges to increase now that the customer friendly changes we've made, which meaningfully reduce these fees are fully on the run rate.
The increase in deposit service charges in the second quarter also reflected higher treasury management fees in wholesale banking.
Mortgage banking revenue increased $50 million from the first quarter, as lower servicing income primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, including higher loan payoffs was offset by higher mortgage origination fees.
The decline in compensation and benefits reflected $676 million in seasonally lower personnel expense and $243 million in lower deferred compensation expense, which is P&L neutral, partially offset by the full quarter impact from salary increases, as well as one additional payroll day.
As we show on page 18, expenses were down $533 million from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses, core deposit and other intangibles amortization and FDIC expense.
We currently expect our 2019 expenses to be near the high end of our target range, as investments in risk management, including data and technology have exceeded expectations and are anticipated to continue.
Turning to our business segments starting on page 20, community banking earnings increased $324 million from the first quarter, driven by seasonally lower personnel expense.
We have $30 million digital active customers in the second quarter, up 4% from a year ago, including 8% growth in mobile active customers.
On page 22, we highlight the decline in teller and ATM transactions, down 7% from a year ago, reflecting continued customer migration to digital channels, and we consolidated 38 branches in the second quarter.
Turning to page 23, wholesale banking earnings increased $19 million from the first quarter, driven by lower provision for credit losses.
Wealth and investment management earnings increased $25 million from the first quarter, driven by seasonally lower personnel expense and higher asset based fees.
Turning to page 25, we continue to have strong credit results with our net charge-off rate declining to 28 basis points in the second quarter, and net charge-offs down $42 million from the first quarter, driven by lower consumer losses.
In summary, our second quarter results reflected increased customer activity, strong credit performance and higher capital returns.
They haven't flown to the bottom line because you've had incremental investments in things like I believe risk management, regulatory compliance, operational risk.
Because I would think that at some point you have these investments in the run rate, and you actually start to see it flow to the bottom line, especially given what -- to be what seems like somewhat bloated cost structure relative to your peers.
On the business sale side you guys have talked about I think the expected contribution or detraction from the retirement sales and then Eastdil in the fourth quarter.
Wanted to just ask another question on expenses if I may, so you mentioned that you had concluded this quarter that there is a little bit more work to do and given consensus expectations for 2020 of $51 billion.
And 2020 is going to be impacted by where we finish this year, what's going on with loan and deposit flows, this discussion about where deposit pricing for our peers -- for us and our peers is at that time, depending on whether the Fed is marching down or if things are very stable, and of course, could go either way and itÂs relatively benign economic environment overall and can't see a compelling course for much more action than what people are currently imagining or having priced in.
One thing that we haven't talked about and as much as these rate cuts and the interest rate environment are making a little bit harder for us to make money to the extent that they really do elongate this recovery and we end up with benign credit conditions and we end up with robust consumer spending and flows and businesses remain healthy and borrow and continue to invest even at these relatively subdued levels.
So I can't -- that matters in terms of how we respond to the question, because of the rates of loan and deposit growth will be different in the continued expansion than they would be without it.
It's the second line in the financial services parlance, but there are people in control functions in the businesses who are doing the actual work, right.
Again, because stress capital buffer works as a point estimate and is -- and can create that kind of volatility, if whether it's by multi-year averaging, or in some other way, they reduce the risk of a hard transition like that then we may very well consider operating with capital target that we have today.
On deposit service charges, so, yes, we're comping over the customer friendly actions, we did have a disproportionate level of fee waivers in the first quarter, which makes the first quarter to the second quarter probably look like a little bit of steeper jump than I would trend from this point forward.

wellsfargo,q3,2019,"We had $244 million in mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments driven predominantly by higher prepayment rate estimates on our MSRs. These valuation adjustments resulted in our mortgage banking revenue declining from the second quarter despite an increase in mortgage originations and higher production margins.
These increases were partially offset by declines in commercial banking and lower government and institutional banking and middle market lending and in commercial capital driven by seasonally lower commercial distribution finance dealer floor plan loans.
Commercial real estate loans declined $2.2 billion from the second quarter with declines in both commercial real estate mortgage and commercial real estate construction loans reflecting increased market liquidity, higher refinancing activity, and continued credit discipline.
Our market share growth reflects the benefit of the transformational changes we have made in the business including process improvements that have resulted in faster credit decision response times.
Net interest income declined $470 million from the second quarter primarily due to balance sheet re-pricing driven by the impact of the lower interest rate environment as well as $133 million of higher MBS premium amortization costs due to higher pre-payments.
Mortgage banking revenue declined $292 million from the second quarter driven by a $419 million decline in servicing income primarily due to the valuation adjustments on our MSRs reflecting higher prepayment rate estimates.
Partially offsetting this decline was $127 million increase in net gains on mortgage loan originations and sales activities.
Residential held for sale mortgage loan originations totaled $38 billion in the third quarter and the production margin on these originations increased to 121 basis points with higher margins in both retail and correspondent channels, driven by capacity constraints.
The increase in compensation and benefits reflected higher salaries expense primarily driven by one additional day in the quarter, a change in staffing mix and higher severance expense partially offset by lower deferred comp expense.
Turning to our Business segments starting on page 19, community banking earnings declined $2.1 billion from the second quarter, primarily driven by higher operating losses reflecting higher litigation accruals.
Our internal credit grades are at their strongest levels in two years and since third quarter of 2017 our criticized loan balances have declined 20% with broad-based improvement across all commercial asset classes.

Let me close our call by thanking all of you for your questions and for joining our third quarter conference call.
Thank you for joining our call today where our Interim CEO and President, Allen Parker; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions.
That strength was demonstrated by, among other things, increases in loan and deposit balances both from the second quarter and from a year ago, our highest branch customer experience scores in over three years, and continued growth in primary consumer checking customers.
While our financial results in the third quarter were impacted by these items, as Allen summarized and we highlight on slide three, we continue to have positive business momentum with strong customer activity.
Compared with the third quarter of 2018, revenue was stable with an increase of $1 billion in non-interest income driven by the sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business, largely offset by a $947 million decline in net interest income.
Our effective income tax rate increased to 22.1% in the third quarter, reflecting a net discrete income tax expense of $443 million, predominantly related to the non-tax-deductible treatment of the $1.6 billion discrete litigation accrual.
Turning to page seven, average loans were up $10.3 billion from a year ago and increased $2.3 billion from the second quarter.
Turning to deposits on page 11, average deposits increased 2% from both a year ago and the second quarter.
Average deposits increased $22.4 billion from the second quarter with growth in wholesale banking as well as retail banking deposits which continue to benefit from promotional rates and offers.
The increase from the second quarter was driven by continued retail deposit campaign pricing for new deposits so that we begun lower promotional rates in terms in response to market conditions.
On page 12, we provide details on period-end deposits which grew 3% from a year ago and 2% from the second quarter.
Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $11.9 billion from the second quarter driven by higher retail banking deposits including growth in high yield savings and CDs. These increases were partially offset by a $2.5 billion reduction in corporate Treasury deposits, the second consecutive quarter of declines.
As always, net interest income will be influenced by a number of factors including loan growth, pricing spreads, the level of rates and the slope of the yield curve.
Turning to page 14, non-interest income increased $896 million for the second quarter driven by the gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business.
Turning to expenses on page 15, expenses increased from both the second quarter and a year ago, largely due to higher operating losses, primarily reflecting litigation accruals.
Turning to page 22, wholesale banking earnings declined $145 million from the second quarter, driven by lower net interest income reflecting the impact of the lower interest rate environment.
Wealth and investment management earnings increased $678 million from the second quarter, driven by the gain on the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business.
Turning to page 24, we continue to have strong credit results with our net charge-off rate declining to 27 basis points in the third quarter.
Credit card net charge-offs have been relatively stable as we've been thoughtful in our efforts to generate new account growth, including the launch of our Propel American Express Card last year, and while auto and net charge-offs increased from the second quarter due to seasonality, they were down from a year ago even as we've grown originations by 45%.
In summary, while we had a number of significant items that impacted our third quarter financial results, we had strong underlying business fundamentals, including growth in loans and deposits, increased customer activity, strong credit performance, and higher capital returns.
Yes, well, it's complicated, because there's a lot of things going into it include where rates go versus what the market is suggesting, what happens with loan pricing, deposit pricing, and a variety of things, but if we, in the various scenarios that we run thinking about, let's say, the 9/30 implied forward curve, which suggests Fed funds in the 170 area, 12/31 of this year the 10-year just under 170, and then a year forward, Fed funds in the 120 area and Fed funds still in the 170 -- pardon me, 10-year still in the 170 area.
John, sort of a follow-up question on costs, I guess if I look at the reiterated 2019 expense guide, it implies a pretty meaningful downdraft in costs in the 4Q, maybe if you could just take a moment to go through sort of the puts and takes and how you bring costs down in the coming quarter?
With the deposit cost increases slowing, might we have seen kind of the end of the deposit cost rise for you guys this quarter assuming rates stay flat to down from here, kind of just trying to think if this could be the max paying quarter for NIM where you had the deposit costs up and loan yields down, and maybe some just puts and takes for the fourth quarter on NIM versus this quarter?
Yes, so my expectation is that deposit costs will be cheaper in the fourth quarter reflecting what you described in terms of kind of the burning out of the higher cost deposits that got layered in before the Fed began to ease.
I think we should -- maybe it was last quarter, one of the things that we mentioned is that we're building a control environment for the company as it exists today, and there is just through process consolidation and process reengineering, there's an opportunity for the company to be a whole lot more simplified as we roll forward, and both the cost of delivery and the cost of overseeing that from a risk and control perspective would be expected to be more efficient.
Hey, John, one follow-up on the NII side, so you keeping their minus 6 NII I got for the year kind of gets you 11 fours for the year, and down even five next year kind of holds you at that 11 four-ish, and so I know there're so many potential permutations of what happens with the rate environment, but maybe you can just help us talk through how much you expect the balance sheet to grow then, or how -- versus how close you're starting to get towards the asset cap, and what constraints if anything, might you have as this gets further out?
I mean within the relevant range of expectations of loan and deposit growth, I wouldn't think of the asset cap as being as really coming into play in our forecast horizon, in part, because there are plenty of levers that we can pull that don't have real customer impact in terms of consumers and our business customers, and we've talked about some of those before in terms of some of the institutional deposits that we take or other wholesale funding that we use, and then, there are some assets that don't work that hard for us from a balance sheet perspective.
So, I guess the low single-digit growth rates for loans and deposits is probably a reasonable proxy for a reasonable placeholder for thinking about how 2020 unfolds, could be a range of different outcomes, but that would be consistent with what I mentioned earlier in terms of how you might forecast the different rate paths and getting to a low to mid single-digits down percentage in net interest income for 2020 versus 2019.
Understood, thanks, and a follow-up on the fee side, we got the IRT coming out, did you spoke about it, was in the deck, and then you've got Estill [ph], can you just help us understand how you are thinking about how that just nets out as we get past this year as well in terms of revenue and expense trajectory?
Estill coming out starting in the fourth quarter, it was probably a little bit bigger in terms of dollars of revenue per quarter, and you'll see it mostly in the commercial mortgage brokerage line item in the P&L, it shows up in a couple of others areas too and have investment banking fees, but similarly the expenses approximate the revenue in our own experience.
Staying on the loan growth topic, you saw some pretty good declines in the commercial real estate portfolios this quarter again and just want to get your updated thoughts there, that's the one area that you're expect to see some runoff still or another words lack of growth, I guess?
And so we really have to pick our spots in order to maintain our risk reward, credit and pricing and loan terms quality, and it's also one of those areas where, frankly, your weakest loans end up getting refinanced away from you, which is also late cycle behavior by the way, so we're still very comfortable with what we have on the books, but I wouldn't look for it to grow meaningfully until the cycle turns and until our best customers have really interesting opportunities to put their own capital to work and we help them do it.
And then just specifically like as we think about, you know, exiting fourth quarter at net interest income, you're obviously going to be caring or absorbing higher than normal bond premium amortization.
And then just last question all this, as we think about exiting this year, just assuming rates stay where they are now, does that go to zero or there's still going to be just some ongoing amount in the fourth quarter?
I appreciate it, if you don't want to comment on this too much, but just going back to the legal reserve estimate, understanding the official number will come out in the Q, but we had that $800 million jump and now we're getting that $1.6 billion charge or the jump in the high-end of the legal reserve estimate, and now the charge in the current quarter and just the operating losses, and just curious if there's any color on, do you get a sense we're starting to get more towards the light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to this?

wellsfargo,q4,2019,"Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Charlie Scharf and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions.
Our franchises are world class and are in the sweet spot of providing necessary financial services for consumers, small businesses and middle market and large corporate companies.
The output of this work will provide us roadmaps to not only improve our performance within each business, but also position us to understand our opportunities across the company and prioritize accordingly.
We had a $153 million linked-quarter decrease in low income housing tax credit investment income, reflecting a timing change of expected tax benefit recognition.
But I want to highlight that our effective income tax rate was 19.1% in the fourth quarter, which included a net discrete income tax expense of $303 million, predominantly related to the non-tax-deductible treatment of certain litigation accruals.
Originations were down 1% linked quarter on seasonality but increased 45% from a year ago, reflecting a renewed emphasis on growing auto loans following the restructuring of the business.
Our average deposit cost of 62 basis points increase 7 basis points from year ago, reflecting promotional pricing in retail banking for new deposits earlier in the year and the mix shift to higher costs deposit -- higher cost products across our consumer and commercial businesses.
Our average deposit cost declined 9 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting lower rates in wholesale banking and WIM.
We did not run any broad based retail banking marketing promotions for deposits during the fourth quarter.
However, retail banking deposits increased 2 basis points due to the continued impact from previous promotional campaigns and deposit gathering strategies over the past year when interest rates were higher.
While we continue to offer our customers competitive promotional savings and CD rates within our branches, retail Banking deposit costs are expected to start to decline in the first quarter as higher promotional rates expire.
Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $16 billion from the third quarter, driven by higher retail banking deposits, including growth and high yield savings and interest bearing checking.
Mortgage Banking revenues increased $317 million from the third quarter.
Servicing income was up $165 million due to a negative MSR valuation adjustment in the third quarter, reflecting higher prepayment rates.
Net gains on mortgage loan originations also increased from higher gains associated with exercising service or clean up calls in the fourth quarter.
Net gains from equity securities were down $505 million from the third quarter as lower gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships were partially offset by $240 million increase in deferred comp plan investment results, which again are largely P&L neutral.
Running the business non-discretionary expense increased by $1.5 billion of higher operating losses, partially offset by lower core deposit and other intangibles amortization expense.
Community Banking earnings declined $570 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by lower net interest income and lower net gains from equity securities.
Our customer satisfaction scores improved by 9 points from last year study, the largest increase among our large bank peers.
Wholesale banking earnings declined $151 million from the third quarter, driven by lower revenue.
And total client assets increased 10% from a year ago on higher market valuations, including 18% growth in retail brokerage advisory assets.
Closed referred investment assets resulting from the partnership between WIM and Community Banking were up 18% in the fourth quarter compared with the year ago with December having over $1 billion in closed referrals our strongest month since June of 2017.
While the allowance for consumer credit losses is expected to be $1.5 billion higher under CECL, reflecting longer or indeterminate maturities that have recoveries and collateral value predominantly related to residential mortgage loans, which have been written down significantly below current recovery value during the last credit cycle.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonnell with Autonomous Research.
So early on here while we're still going through this planning process, I wouldn't expect that much to change other than the -- some of the adjustments that we all make for deferred comp, for excess operating losses et cetera.
So that we originally talked about the $600 million, it reflected the $150 million per quarter of fraud related losses and other run rate operating losses without regard for what's been elevated over the last couple of years.
The bulk of the C&I loan growth overall did come from commercial or corporate investment banking related activity.
The trust and investment fees should step off at a high level, because they price off of the opening deck, which for the S&P looks good for the coming quarter, that leverage it creates cyclicality that works for us and against us.
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
John, can you share with us, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expected the net interest income to be down low to mid-single digits for 2020 over 2019.
I guess, now a year and a half ago, but it used to be the case that we'd have to actually realize something to recognize the benefit something have to be sold or go public in order for us to take a gain and these days even with private companies doing subsequent private capital raises.
Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
I know you're going to have equity market tailwinds just from what happened in the fourth quarter as we enter the year in 2020, but I'm just hoping if you could frame whether that $32 billion annualized run rate is a reasonable jumping-off point after adjusting for some of those factors or anything else that you would cite for that matter?
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
And then without putting any specific numbers around it like as you think about improving efficiency, there are comments as it could be both kind of revenue and expenses, should we think about it being somewhat balanced or the vast majority coming from expenses or too early to know right now?
Your final question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.
It's been a busy time as I have been working to get to know the company, our opportunities and challenges and I've learned a lot.
These changes are in addition to many other senior people who have joined the company over the past few years in important roles, such as Heads of Risk, HR, internal audits, and technology.
We had a number of significant items in the fourth quarter that impacted our results, which we highlight on Page 2 of our supplement.
While our financial results in the fourth quarter were impacted by these items, as we show on Page 3, we continue to have positive business momentum with strong customer activity, which I'll highlight throughout the call.
Commercial loans increased $3.4 billion from the third quarter, driven by broad-based C&I growth in corporate and investment banking.
On Page 12, we provide details on period end deposits, which grew 3% from a year ago and 1% from the third quarter.
Wholesale banking deposits were up $15.9 billion from the third quarter, driven by seasonality and growth in existing and new customer balances.
On the earnings call last quarter, we said we expected our 2019 expenses to be approximately $53 billion, which was at the high end of our $52 billion to $53 billion target range.
Wealth and Investment Management earnings declined $1 billion from the third quarter, which included $1.1 billion pretax gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business.
We continue to have strong credit results with 32 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter.
In summary, while we had a number of significant items that impacted our fourth quarter financial results and our expenses remain too high, we continue to have positive underlying business fundamentals, including growth in loans and deposits, increased customer activity and strong credit performance.
I will say that in the time that I spent with Saul Van Beurden, who is our Head of Technology at the company, we have a really clear list of the work that we have to do, to both improve the underlying infrastructure of the institution, which will benefit our ability to grow at some point, because it really contributes to our ability to servicing all of our clients across all of our different segments, as well as we possibly can.
At the same time, it's clear when I spent time with all of our folks that we are thinking about where we go next and how we use technology to create different experiences and we see it in terms of some of the things that we've done in the digital space on the consumer side.
Charlie, to your points about just going after all the things to put the company on the right foot forward.
So on the first question, I think when you're on the inside of the company and we're managing the work that has to get done the way that we are, we have clear reporting, we have clear goals, item by item by item.
And just one follow up on your point that couple months in, you said you're going to look at like 10 business lines and just see where we should think about things from a bottom up.
From what you at least see now, is the company what it needs to look like going forward, the company has been trimming out of some areas over the course of time?
And so that goes to asking the question, are we spending appropriately on the historical issues and that number will be whatever we think it should be.
And so when we look at all the additional resources that have been added to support these activities, it's very difficult for you all to see what we have gained in terms of efficiency, because you should just assume that our expenses would be substantially higher if we hadn't been generating efficiencies in the rest of the company over last several years.
And so that's why were just being very, very careful about leading you to a specific number, because we're not sure where that all nets itself out and we want the time to be thoughtful about how to put it all together in a way that we certainly believe is the right long-term thing for the company.
She is responsible for a whole series of things from deposits to treasury services, to card, to innovation, digital marketing, a very, very wide range of things and we're actively working through what the right way to structure the company is with her retirement.
So I think answering the question of what that all looks like by the end of the year at this point is even premature.
I think we will be talking about realized results and what drove them over the course of the year, including closure of issues to the extent that those are public items and then how we set ourselves up in our stakeholders up for what comes next.
So another question on the regulatory side, I think one of the things regulators always had said is they wanted to see a change in the culture at the bank as the sign that things are improving.
And I think as an outsider coming in, I do have the opportunity to make some observations of some of the things that we do versus some of the things that I've seen that could help to make the company successful, going through issues that are somewhat like this.
And so, I do think that these changes that I spoke about are important to helping us be more successful at closing these issues in a way that has eluded us at this point.
John, I want to ask you first, this $1.5 billion is a big number for this particular quarter.
So again, I think what's relevant is that I've been able to come in with this fresh set of eyes, believe that we have an opportunity to manage these blocks of work differently with both a different set of processes, some different people and a great deal of my time and attention, as well as the rest of the senior management team.
And I guess maybe a different way to think about it is when you've seen these things happened in the past.
And they've set their strategic priorities and direction, and they are different than what had been under development in terms of the technology to support different parts of the business over the past few years, which is what resulted in the impairment to capitalize software development costs.
And so, like any other year on an adjusted basis, you'd expect them to be higher in the first quarter and gravitate down over the course of the year, as Charlie mentioned, we're going through a second look at our planning process for the year.
But like any other company, we should sit and ask the question, do we need to be doing absolutely everything and we have been pruning along the way.
There are some of these that we believe that even while we're doing our work we should be driving and growing and then some that will reflect the cycle of the market that we're in mortgage comes to mind in terms of where we are in the rate cycle and things like that.
That's not to say to get the best-in-class that we won't need some revenue growth to get there, but I just find it very encouraging the way people internally are thinking about it and what they're talking about as the types of things that'll be in the line of sight.
Again, I know it's too early to give a more accurate expense expectation, but I know you're going through your planning process, so what's the timing, when should we think we will get a more precise expectation when it comes to full year expenses, Charlie?

Then John will provide more details on the first quarter results before we take your questions.
But the banks including Wells Fargo are financially strong and they've done a great job as many other industries have in providing continued service while many of our employees have been unable to access their offices.
Within wealth and investment management, period and deposit balances increased 30% during the quarter driven by higher retail brokerage sweeps, reflecting higher client cash allocations.
And despite market declines Wells Fargo Asset Management AUM still grew 2% during the quarter driven by strong inflows into money market funds.
Commercial loans grew $52 billion or 10% from the fourth quarter, and overall global debt capital markets activity was the strongest on record driven by high grade offerings from US issuers whose volumes were up 63% compared to a year ago.
Wells Fargo's high grade debt capital markets lead table rankings improved from fourth to third with 9.2% fee based market share during the quarter.
While deferred compensation plan investment results did not meaningfully impact the bottom line, they increased net losses from equity securities by $621 million and reduced employee benefits expense by $598 million.
We had $464 million of operating losses which were down $1.5 billion from the fourth quarter that included elevated litigation accruals.
Mortgage banking income declined $404 million from the fourth quarter driven by mark-to-market losses on loans held for sale and higher MSR asset valuation losses as a result of assumption updates primarily prepayment estimates.
Credit card loans declined $2.4 billion from the fourth quarter driven by seasonality and fewer new account openings.
This growth included the late quarter impacts of flight to quality deposits across all business lines following the emergence of COVID-19 as well as the inflow of deposits associated with corporate and commercial loan draws.
Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $41.1 billion, or 5% from the fourth quarter, including higher retail banking deposits largely driven by growth in high yield savings and interest bearing checking.
Net interest income increased $112 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting $356 million higher hedge ineffectiveness accounting results attributable to the level of market rates and differences in basis in notional and swaps hedging our long term debt.
$84 million of lower MBS premium amortization resulting from lower realized prepays partially offset by balance sheet re-pricing, including the impact of lower interest rate environment as our assets re-priced down faster than our liabilities and from one fewer day of the quarter.
Lower mortgage banking income reflected unrealized losses of approximately $143 million on residential loans, and $62 million on commercial loans held for sale due to illiquid market conditions and a widening of credit spreads.
This impact is recorded in net gain on mortgage loan originations and the $143 million loss reduced the production margin we report on residential held for sale originations.
Mortgage banking results also reflected $192 million of higher losses on the valuation of our MSR asset as a result of assumption updates primarily prepayment estimates.
Net losses from equity securities also included $935 million of impairments, reflecting lower market valuation.
Operating losses declined $1.5 billion from the fourth quarter, which included elevated litigation accruals.
Community banking earnings declined $274 million from the fourth quarter reflecting higher provision expense as well as net losses from equity securities.
Turning to Page 27, teller and ATM transactions are reported through March which is when we reduced our branch hours and temporarily closed approximately one fourth of our branches as a result of COVID-19, which resulted in approximate 50% decline in teller volume during the final weeks in the first quarter compared with a year ago.
Period-end deposit balances increased 13% from the fourth quarter, reflecting higher cash allocation and brokerage client assets and assets under management and our Wells Fargo Asset Management business grew significantly driven by over $34 billion of inflows into our money market funds.
Despite the market volatility closed referred investment assets into WIM from the consumer bank partnership increased on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis and flows into our retail brokerage advisory business remain positive in the first quarter.

Hi, thanks for taking my questions Charlie and John, couple of things.
Good morning, I'm going to open the call with comments on the current environment, the actions we're taking, our business performance and ongoing work to transform the company.
In the month of March alone, our commercial customers utilized over $80 billion of their loan commitments, and we're providing accommodations for clients in need.
Turning to the quarter, you can see that results were materially impacted by loan loss reserves, impairment of securities and redemption of deferred securities.
Our results included a reserve build of $3.1 billion for loans and debt securities, 950 million of securities impairment predominantly related to equity securities and a negative $0.06 impact related to the redemption of our Series K Preferred Stock.
We had $4 billion of provision expense for credit losses, reflecting the expected impact these unprecedented times could have on our customer's creditworthiness.
Turning to Page 8, I'll be covering the income statement drivers throughout the call, but I wanted to highlight that our effective income tax rate was 19.5% in the first quarter, and included net discrete income tax expense of $141 million.
I'll be highlighting most of the balance sheet drivers on Page 9 throughout the call, but I will note here that the economic environment our customers are facing due to COVID-19 caused our balance sheet to expand as loan demand and deposit inflows increased significantly late in the first quarter.
Driven by strong loan demand Â loan growth in March, our total assets grew $53.8 billion from year end to $1.981 trillion.
As Charlie highlighted even with this growth, we continue to operate in compliance with the asset cap of $1.952 trillion, as compliance is measured at each quarter end based on the two-quarter daily average.
During these challenging times, we expect load and deposit growth could continue, but cannot provide guidance on the level of growth and we're actively working to create balance sheet capacity to help our customers.
Let's look at the drivers with the balance sheet growth we had in the first quarter starting with average loans on Page 11.
Period-end loans increased $61.6 billion or 6% from a year ago, and $47.6 billion or 5% from the fourth quarter.
Commercial loans grew $52 billion or 10% from the fourth quarter as balance sheet declines earlier in the first quarter were more than offset by strong growth late in the quarter.
The growth in commercial loans in the first quarter included more than $80 billion in borrower draw activity in the month of March on commercial banking and corporate investment banking loans.
Consumer loans were down $4.4 billion, or 1% from the fourth quarter as declines in credit card loans, consumer real estate loans and other revolving loans were partially offset by growth in auto loans.
Junior lien mortgage loans were down $982 million from the fourth quarter as continued pay downs more than offset new originations and $1.8 billion of draws on existing lines, which was up meaningfully late in the first quarter.
Turning to commercial loans on Page 14, C&I loans were up $50.9 billion from the fourth quarter with broad based growth across business lines, largely driven by draws of revolving lines of clients reacting to the economic slowdown associated with a pandemic.
Commercial real estate loans were up 1.8 billion from the fourth quarter, with growth in both CRE mortgage and construction loans.
Turning to the entertainment and recreation industry on Slide 17, we had a total of $16.2 billion of loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, with less than 1% to cruise lines.
At the end of the first quarter, we had $14.1 billion of loans outstanding to retail excluding shopping centers, within the commercial real estate mortgage portfolio and $10.6 billion in loans outstanding for the hotel, motel industry.
We had largely declines in wholesale banking and WIM while our retail banking deposit costs declined at a slower pace, since they were lower to begin with and continue to be impacted from promotional pricing in early 2019, most of which will expire in the second quarter.
On Page 20, we provide details on period-end deposits, which better reflect the strong growth we had at the end of the first quarter, with total deposits up $53.9 billion, or 4% from year end.
Also, banking deposits were up $13.5 billion from the fourth quarter driven by commercial banking and commercial real estate revolving line draws, partially offset by lower financial institutions deposits, reflecting actions taken to manage the asset cap.
Turning to Page 22, noninterest income declines $2.3 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by a $1.9 billion decline in net gains from equity securities, and $404 million of lower mortgage banking income.
Turning to Page 28, wholesale banking earnings declined $2.2 billion from the fourth quarter, reflecting a $2.2 billion increase in provision expense.
I've already highlighted the strong loan and deposit growth from our commercial customers in the first quarter.
Turning to Page 30, our net charge-off rate was up six basis points from the fourth quarter to 38 basis points, predominantly driven by higher C&I losses primarily related to higher losses in our oil and gas portfolio, reflecting significant declines in oil prices.
Oil and gas loans outstanding increased 5% linked quarter and 7% from a year ago, reflecting increased utilization rates, driven by the impact of COVID-19 and the decline in oil prices.
This increase was driven by a number of factors including economic sensitivity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the estimated impact to industries most adversely affected by the pandemic, our exposure to the oil and gas industry, draws on loan commitments during the quarter, which were the primary driver of commercial loan growth, and a $141 million reserve build for debt securities reflecting economic and market conditions.
With respect to the other tradeoffs, as I mentioned, the first places that we're going to be able to create more capacity to help customers are to reduce non-operational deposits, principally in the financial institutions area, where relatively easily substitutable and it's a low value use of cap balance sheet because there's a high runoff factor on those types of deposits and there are tens of billions of dollars of those types of deposits to continue to work down.
And second question, John, understanding fully the pulling away from giving full year guidance, is there a way you can help us understand on the NII front, just how you'd expect the trajectory at least to go from first to second, given the changes and all the moving parts that were in this quarter's results?
We've got the Â I think we're all forecasting something like zero in the front end or with depending on where LIBOR moves over time, and then some number between call it 70 and 100 basis points at the long-end.
A couple of questions, one, just on the outlook for CECL and CECL charges, I mean, you obviously went through in detail what you did this most recent quarter, but just trying to understand what kind of unemployment level you're assuming in that just so if we see a trajectory differently from your assumptions, we know how to think about reserve builds from here.
I mean, the price is obviously a little bit lower, but I'm thinking that your book has changed a bit, maybe if you give us some color on how you're dealing with that portfolio and what your expectations are there?
We would continue to monitor where your capital levels are relative to the minimum and because of the balance sheet restriction, unlike some peers, you are less able to eat through your capital through RWA growth, is that the right way to think about the dividend going forward?
And also just clarify what you said John, you said that potentially the losses, the cumulative losses, this cycle would be 50% of the severely adverse, which I think for nine quarters was 26 billion.
John, I think you mentioned at one point during the call, there has perhaps been a little bit of an abating in the pace of line of credit draws.
And as I mentioned in response to the question about NII guidance, whether or not those balances remain outstanding will have an impact on this quarter one way or the other.
Having said that these types of customers will have stress often in their origination function, if they're an originator or in their ongoing capital accumulation if they're an asset manager, there can be stressed on the servicing side of this for those that are our residential mortgage oriented, their life's going to be a little bit harder, presumably as servicing, servicing advances default servicing, things like that pop up, and so we're managing them in that way.
So I kind of want to get your perspective on how much of that do you think is a reflection of just Â you guys have a lower loss content loans, a better risk profile of it, as opposed to maybe some other more idiosyncratic things as I seem to recall that you've marked some loans in the past that were in recovery positions and stuff like that.
And the allowance if they're to serve both our credit card portfolio, which under most conditions we wish was a bigger capability for Wells Fargo in times like this is a little bit of a saving grace because we expected loss content both in what's outstanding as well as what might be expected to come through from undrawn is more manageable in the size of our balance sheet.
Is that a fair assumption at this point, given the Â given your expectation for the ongoing stress on borrowers et cetera, that we could have incremental builds or do you think the Â we're at an adequate level given the recast of the bank's [ph] book and what you put on this current quarter in terms of where your reserve stands at this point.
In terms of how things have leveled off, the prior question about whether there was window dressing going on through the quarter and where our borrowers wanted to have cash on their balance sheet, certainly possible that that was a part of it.
It seems like expenses in the first quarter came in a bit lower than expected even if we adjust for the deferred comp noise, any outlook that you could provide on cost for the year?
And then a separate question and there was a lot of kind of one off items in the quarter that were due just to where markets were at the end of the quarter or more spreads were, another was the reserve for debt securities, equity impairments and then often has an effectiveness and it was expected to reverse given where markets are, at this point in time or where rates are for the hedging activity.
So criticized loan balances increased about $4 billion in the quarter almost all of it in March.
We're going to stop saying that because now we're early in the cycle and we'll be working with each of you to help understand or answer your questions where we can and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
