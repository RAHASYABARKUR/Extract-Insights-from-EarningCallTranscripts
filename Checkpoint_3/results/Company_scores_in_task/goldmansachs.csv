goldmansachs,q2,2015,"I'll walk you through the second quarter and year-to-date results then I'm happy to answer any questions.
In the second quarter, we recorded net provisions for mortgage related litigation and regulatory matters of $1.45 billion.
The second quarter of 2015 was another example of the benefits that come with having a diversified global client franchise.
If you look at our first half results, excluding the $1.45 billion litigation charge in the second quarter of 2015, you can see the embedded operating leverage, with expenses flat relative to revenues that are up 7% compared to last year.
We continue to see the benefit of our leading global franchise, with second quarter revenues at the highest level since 2007.
Equity underwriting revenues of $595 million rose 12% compared to the first quarter, due to an increase in IPOs. During the second quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equity businesses, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter, down 34% compared to the seasonally-stronger first quarter.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and include $153 million of DBA gains.
Net revenues were down substantially from the first quarter, as client activity declined across our businesses and market-making conditions were more difficult.
In Equities, which includes Equities Client Execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $2 billion, down 14% quarter-over-quarter and included $32 million in DBA gains.
Moving on to our Investing and Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.8 billion in the second quarter.
On the other hand, the operating environment for our FICC clients was more challenged in the second quarter.
Our focus is on the strength of our global client franchise, the quality of our people, and the long term trends driving our businesses.
As much as we are focused on the present, we are also focused on the future, and we enter it knowing we have a great set of businesses, we have tremendous client relationships, we have world-class people and execution capabilities, and last but not least, we have an improving competitive and operating landscape.
I think FICC and I&L take a lot of everyone's focus, but in FICC specifically, I wonder if you could help us, how much of that was a late quarter phenomenon?
And then most importantly, I think last quarter you felt really good about market share in client facilitation side of the business, and I'm curious if you can give any comments on parsing that out, the facilitation versus the marks in the quarter?
Early in the quarter, obviously, there was a big reversal in the macro trend with respect to how people were thinking about currencies and interest rates.
And so it's not surprising that we saw reduced client activity in the quarter and obviously more difficult market-making environment.
In terms of ÃÂÃÂ it was really more pronounced as the quarter went along as Greece really dominated the headlines and liquidity was challenged in parts of the market.
Too early to tell in terms of where we are in this quarter, Glenn, but obviously, the news around Greece has been obviously very positive in the last couple of days.
So in terms of how we think about it, and obviously these competitive trends they take years to really formulate.
But I think the big change and I talked about this a little bit in my script, but to be more specific about it, the capital-intensive parts of the business and really let's just start with the fixed income parts of the business, given the regulatory demands around that part of the business to deliver for your clients and drive appropriate returns for shareholders, that is actually where we think the competitive advantage is most significant.
And so, as people exit the business, obviously, the impact of the marginal pressure on risk when you're deploying capital should be beneficial and we're leaders in all those parts of the franchise, but I think this is going to be a multi-year phenomenon.
So as you pointed out, we obviously have been pretty dynamic with respect ÃÂÃÂ I think the greatest example was a year ago when we brought the balance sheet down by nearly $60 million in the quarter.
But just wanted to get a sense, are you seeing any, either market share gains in that part of the business or is it more environment and clients' investors getting more active in the asset class?
I think, obviously, it has been a good solid couple of quarters.
And as I said earlier, as activity has picked up outside of the U.S., I can't tell necessarily whether or not it's share pickup from other firms, but obviously, you've seen actually in the first quarter even, those firms with strong equity franchises seem to be getting the lion's share of the activity.
And then on the tax rate, just wanted to understand, if I exclude the item related to the legal reserve, it looks like the core tax rate still was relatively low versus expectations, in line with last quarter.
With respect to litigation, again, the charge we took this quarter is ÃÂÃÂ the vast majority of that is related to the RMBS Working Group.
Yeah, it's a great question, Betsy, and obviously, a difficult one to think about over the next couple of years.
And I think one of the reasons why, as you point out, we're seeing potential big restructurings on the European side is that even without the SIFI charge potential that we have in the United States ÃÂÃÂ and who knows what they'll do over time, maybe the playing field will be completely level ÃÂÃÂ they're struggling in those businesses at current capital levels.
And I think it's very clear at this stage that the increased regulatory requirements, however you think about them, but let's just think mostly in terms of capital, while obviously very good for the system and significant improvement for all firms.
I don't want to beat a dead horse, but on the litigation question, the litigation charge, presumably to add that much based on the Working Group issues that you referred to, there must have been an event, a point in your discussions with them that began to give you a sense for a figure.
Just trying to think through how that should be thought of going forward in terms of the equity franchise.
So again, whenever you see these kind of market reactions, obviously, it has some impact in terms of how clients think through their portfolios.
And given everything China's done, maybe we should expect as they go through this, there were (39:51) going to be growing pains from year to year, but the long term trend feels okay to us.
And when we think about it, obviously, we're going to move very cautiously in the space and make sure we get things right, because you're right to point out that, like any new business, there are risks and we want to make sure that we work with the consumers and the regulators in absolutely a first-class and best-class way.
So in the debt line we had $547 million, roughly $550 million in revenues in the quarter.
In the equity line, of the $1.25 billion, roughly a third of that actually comes from public market shares that we own, in entities we've already taken public.
Hey, Harvey, earlier you mentioned that you saw that liquidity was challenged in parts of the market when you were talking about the FICC business.
Your next question is from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets.
I think if you look at our that debt underwriting activity in the first quarter, it wasn't as strong as the second quarter, but yet the FICC results were stronger.
So, Harvey, given the challenging market making backdrop that you experienced in 2Q, I was wondering how that informed your thinking around the issue of trading liquidity more broadly.
And so I think away from that the reason why this is difficult is because it's a question of really what is the multi-year accumulation of regulation?

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio.
Investment Banking and Investment Management net revenues increased year-over-year by 13% and 14% respectively.
The increase in net revenues within these primarily fee-based business s largely offset net revenue declines and are more capital-intensive businesses with a 6% year-over-year decline in Institutional Client Services and a 13% year-over-year decline in Investing and Lending.
And for Institutional Client Services, revenue strength within equities helped offset a difficult operating environment for FICC.
Investment Banking produced second quarter revenues of $2 billion, 6% higher than a strong first quarter.
We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including BHP Billiton's $12.7 billion demerger of South32; Synageva Biopharma's $8.4 billion sale to Alexion Pharmaceuticals; and Imperial Tobacco Group's $7.1 billion acquisition of certain cigarette brands and other assets of Reynolds American and Lorillard.
Debt underwriting revenues of $603 million improved 47% quarter-over-quarter, largely driven by an increase in leverage finance activity.
Leading Qualcomm's $10 billion debt IPO, Daiichi Sankyo's $3.2 billion sale of its stake in Sun Pharmaceutical, and AIG's $3.5 billion sale of its stake in AerCap. Within interest rates and currencies, a shifting macro backdrop negatively impacted client activity and results.
While currency has experienced a significant decline, client activity and interest rates, though sequentially lower, remain solid.
Credit was significantly lower, as credit spreads generally widened during the second quarter and activity levels declined.
Mortgages also declined versus the first quarter, as volatility and client activity remained generally low.
Equities Client Execution net revenues decreased 30% sequentially, to $787 million.
Security services generated net revenues of $443 million, up 13% sequentially, reflecting seasonally-stronger client activity and higher customer balances.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting strong corporate performance and company-specific events in private equity, as well as net gains in public equities.
Revenues benefited from a higher average mix of long-term fee-based products relative to liquidity products.
Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits was again accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%.
The combination of current concern surrounding Greece's widening credit spreads and the reversal of certain macro trends led to lower client activity and a more difficult operating environment.
Our relative position both the strength and the franchise but aggregate position of the firm just positions us quite well over the next couple of years if firms follow through on what they saying and they actually restructure and they begin to redesign those businesses.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Maybe just talk about what you're thinking there on traditional bank strategy in general?
And when you think about Europe over the next several years as they work through what is ÃÂÃÂ our research folks have them at 1.5% growth, but as they work themselves more and more away from the crisis, this is a very good environment for a firm like Goldman Sachs where clients need sound advice across all of our businesses.
By balance sheet I mean things like those businesses that were maybe most mispriced relative to the new requirements.
And so what we think will happen over time is potentially repricing, but also the competitive dynamic looks like one where those firms that can't deliver or can't respond or don't have the same quality franchise, they get removed.
So could you maybe just walk us through your ÃÂÃÂ clearly there's an opportunity to make money, but the question is how you view the potentially higher risk in a retail lending format?
Now we do have millions of clients that touch us in our investment management business through our mutual funds every day.
Hey. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC
So first question, you made some reference to it earlier when you talked a little bit about pricing, but it looks like we're seeing some momentum in your Prime Brokerage business.
But is that $2 billion that you had in profit on ordinary activity before taxes in Goldman Sachs International the right number to look at when you're thinking about the potential impact on tax rates?
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.

goldmansachs,q3,2015,"I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio.
IÃÂÃÂll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results, and IÃÂÃÂm happy to answer any questions.
The sum impact of these various events led to lower levels of client activity and a significant repricing of the equity and credit markets.
This was down substantially compared to the second quarter, due to a decrease of industry wide IPOs and secondary offerings, as higher volatility and a decline in prices reduced activity.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the third quarter and included a $147 million of DVA gains.
Net revenues were down 9% from the second quarter and market-making conditions continue to be challenging.
Moving onto our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $670 million in the third quarter.
The declining global equity markets negatively impacted net revenues and public equities during the quarter.
This would seem like the pay off and yet a pick up in volatility in several asset classes, it feels like actually the world that was coming your way, but yet the revenue reduction for Goldman relative to peers, and IÃÂÃÂm not just talking this quarter, last couple of quarters is more pronounced.
IÃÂÃÂm just trying to do the smell test of all, why is that, because I actually do think that things are lining up that you would be more important to your clients, not less and there would be more opportunities, not less.
So when we think about the forward and we hear the announcements and weÃÂÃÂre in this part of the cycle, but itÃÂÃÂs going to take a while for that to transition through, because I think so far itÃÂÃÂs been more than announcements than a retrenchment, and you wonÃÂÃÂt really see it happen in all the steps weÃÂÃÂve taken until you see a pick up in client activity and the competitive environment continue to shift, that may take a while.
I really think itÃÂÃÂs a question of client environment.
And then just as a follow-up, maybe on capital and the ratios, if you have the CET1, maybe like the fully phased immerse of the transitional, and then just given the decent buffers, just any outlook in terms of where you think you would run that?
And as a shareholder, if you want a collection of businesses, and if you actually look at our performance, consistency of ROE, and returns and earnings, weÃÂÃÂre the most stable.
I think the capital rules, as they come into play and the balance sheet impact of those capital rules in the class has forced a very natural repricing in terms of how much balance sheet we and the industry can provide the clients.
But certainly in the commodity space several quarters ago, there was a lot of activity where certainly competition, which if you want to call that pricing power, I think of it a little bit differently.
And then in the derivative businesses globally, as youÃÂÃÂre seeing firms exit parts of the CDS business and other parts of the equity derivative businesses, I think itÃÂÃÂs early days, but certainly youÃÂÃÂre seeing a reduction in competition, and that translates into pricing power or maybe better said better returns.
And we feel like we maybe able to provide a differentiated product that is accretive to the firms current returns, but itÃÂÃÂs going to be slow going obviously, we built lots of business at Goldman Sachs this is a new business.
But when we think about liability management, again it itÃÂÃÂs really about making sure we have the strongest financial footings at any given point of time.
So, I know youÃÂÃÂre asking me question narrowly, but in terms of running those businesses and particularly FICC, it really is multipart.
So for example weÃÂÃÂre not the biggest emerging markets firm as you know, because we donÃÂÃÂt have offices in hundred countries and itÃÂÃÂs never been the biggest part of our footprint there are certainly always things that weÃÂÃÂre focused on and if you think about our client base, weÃÂÃÂre more skewed I think, because weÃÂÃÂre not the biggest lender in the globe, weÃÂÃÂre more skewed to professional money managers and investors and you saw and you could see their activity moves around.
But we feel good about our client engagements and our market shares, but itÃÂÃÂs a multi-part question is ÃÂÃÂ itÃÂÃÂs not just about clients although theyÃÂÃÂre the most important part and running these businesses, it really is about margins returns over the long-term.
But the breakout I gave you last time really was public equities, which were down and they [part 11 1: 41]more or less in line with global markets and they started $4 billion at the quarter and so certainly there was just the path to mark-to-market.
And then the second question is, kind of what percent of the business would you say pricing is more rational than itÃÂÃÂs been in the past?
So, on the second part IÃÂÃÂd say itÃÂÃÂs the trend is improving in terms of rational pricing, but itÃÂÃÂs in a market where the client engagement from quarter-to-quarter has been very different right, so we saw it in the first quarter, we saw less in second quarter I think that I would answer the electronic trading question as sort of long-term.
Clients really look to de-risk or add risk and they tend to trade electronically, so I would say itÃÂÃÂs a trend, but I donÃÂÃÂt have the specific numbers for you Mike, in terms of the quarter contribution of electronic versus cash, but we can certainly get to that stuff.
Well, I donÃÂÃÂt want to guess on a ballpark, certainly in the third quarter there was a meaningful pick up in electronic activity relative to cash in the equities business and again I donÃÂÃÂt want to guess at a number for you Mike, weÃÂÃÂll be happy to get you one.
I just wanted to follow-up a little bit first on the composition of the change in revenues in equities and FICC from the second to the third quarter in FICC you alluded I think to rates first off as having contributed significantly, and then you mentioned credit and mortgages, was that kind of the ordering of the degree to, which they impacted the revenue move?
Yes, we saw it more in those two businesses, but it was still challenging obviously for credit markets.
And then just final question, which I think is going to relate to I&L, in the release you alluded to a pretty hefty decline in level III assets linked quarter about 15%.
I think itÃÂÃÂs always natural for folks to question when the market has been robust, whether there is information content in the actual activity level as peaking and maybe thatÃÂÃÂs a factor.
But when you look at past cycles theyÃÂÃÂve been more significantly driven by LBO activity where certainly you can get some market capacity and how much debt can be borrowed and itÃÂÃÂs a 100% accurate to note that certainly the cost of financing is a contributor to the transactions that are happening today, but theyÃÂÃÂre much more strategic and a reflection of slower global growth and how confident CEOs are at this stage.
I think if I look at your disclosures you guys balance sheet was up to a level we havenÃÂÃÂt seen in a I think over a year I think balance sheet was up 20 billion plus quarter-over-quarter yet it was a volatile environment, it just looked like you pulled back on risk at least in the bar, can you kind of just help me think through that, you didnÃÂÃÂt close on the deposit franchise acquisition this quarter ÃÂÃÂ third quarter?
Going into the fourth quarter how should we think about the full-year comp ratio in terms of that thereÃÂÃÂd be upward pressure on it if the full-year revenues miss a bit more from here or continued downward pressure the fourth quarter ends up being better and driving you above where you were last year?
The you made a point in the press release about the IB backlog building and just was kind of curious whether or not in your view thatÃÂÃÂs a function improving business outlook or just deals getting held up due to market volatility in some of the trends that we saw impact the FB underwriting line?
And part of that is the markets being more challenges, and challenge in part of the season, but I think that the more important takeaway is less about market influence over the quarter and more about activity levels client confidence, which certainly at times for CEOs would have been tested as we came during the quarter.
So, again itÃÂÃÂs just itÃÂÃÂs the nature of the portfolio, it wonÃÂÃÂt always necessarily be this way in the quarter, but there will be opportunities for us to sell assets and in taking companyÃÂÃÂs public and those kind of things those were usually on a schedule, it usually donÃÂÃÂt happen instantaneously they can certainly get delayed by market activity.
Harvey, I appreciated all your comments on the quarter FICC strategy how are you still committed to business at the same time arenÃÂÃÂt going to be complacent.
And just want to get a sense as to and trying and obviously making a concerted effort not to simply be complacent whether youÃÂÃÂre going to look to shrink risk on and any meaningful way within that business if the pressures persists on the revenue side?
So, I talked about the fact that we made a number of acquisitions in asset management and that fee-based business continues to grow and be a bigger part of the firm.
I think the trade-off obviously is whether or not in making those reductions, does that really impact your ability to deliver to clients.
Can you give us a sense of how we should think about sort of the quarter-to-quarter risk management practices within that unit, given how market volatility can have such a profound effect on revenue recognition in any given period?
And ultimately, if the markets decline for extended periods of time or increase for extended periods, obviously that drives value of underlying assets and it drives activity for all businesses in all industries.
So we obviously consider that I think the most important risk component in the discussion is about the point of actually establishing the investments and thatÃÂÃÂs a long-term process of being disciplined that has to be the philosophy, so look if we see a number of quarters of back to back declining in market that may be the right time to actually being to put capital to work which is why we run with excess capital and we run with excess liquidity because we want to be there for those opportunities and we want to be there for our client.
So, just wanted to see whether or not you think coincidentally, the way that this line is up as you go through the calendar year, revenues are typically stronger in the first half, and you get the comp ratio benefit in the second half and somehow coincidentally that kind of hedges each other.
We are always looking at ways where we can enhance the client experience and so you know all these acquisitions which I mentioned, they really break down to three large buckets, secular growth opportunities like advisory and in that it was referenced in the ÃÂÃÂ as I said in the Pacific Global AdvisorsÃÂÃÂ acquisition, and those things like new product capabilities where we certainly develop new products internally, but there are times both in demand is better for us and thatÃÂÃÂs an example, that would be Westpeak and ActiveBeta and then there are times when we just want to scale existing products like money markets and you have seen us do acquisitions in that space.
In our liability structure, we just like that having a diversified geographic client base, source of liabilities, we just think thatÃÂÃÂs prudent risk management.
In terms of things weÃÂÃÂre trying to do, we feel pretty good about the diversified business.
I mean, if you think about the course of the year to be sitting here basically nearly flat revenues with our fee-based business is picking up activity, which is compensating for our capital intensive parts of the firm, which you would expect to be more challenged in this kind of market environments.
WeÃÂÃÂre always going to look ways to improve the business.
I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
These provisions largely from legacy issues reduced our annualized return on common equity for the first nine months of the year by approximately 3 percentage points.
Not surprisingly, we produced lower quarterly revenues across many of our businesses, given both declining asset prices and reduced level of client activity.
Investment Banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.6 billion, 23% lower than a strong second quarter as underwriting slowed.
Debt underwriting revenues of $557 million were down 8% quarter-over-quarter, a decrease of industry wide issuance volumes was partially offset by acquisition related financing.
During the third quarter, we actively supported our clientÃÂÃÂs financing needs leading HP Enterprises $14.6 billion debt offering related to a spin-off from HP, BiogenÃÂÃÂs $6 billion debt offering, and SimpornoÃÂÃÂs [ph] $1.4 billion rights offering.
Currencies improved sequentially, as the devaluation in the Chinese yuan sparked significant client activity within our emerging market franchise.
Credit decreased, as client activity remains generally low amid continued spread widening.
Mortgages was significantly lower as conditions remained challenged with limited client activity.
EquitiesÃÂÃÂ client execution net revenues decreased 29% sequentially to $555 million.
Broadly speaking, client activity declined versus the second quarter, as higher volatility and global equity market weakness impacted investor conviction and risk appetite.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $370 million.
Assets under supervision reached a record $1.19 trillion, as long-term net inflows more than offset market depreciation.
With respect to long-term flows, organic net inflows were strong at $23 billion.
Over that timeframe, total long-term net inflows were $195 billion.
Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Any steps in terms of vocal adoption happened a number of years ago, where we shutdown certain business.
Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
If youÃÂÃÂre just looking at that set of metrics and obviously our supplementary leverage ratios in very good shape at 58, but CCARs are binding constraints.
So itÃÂÃÂs really two parts weÃÂÃÂve seen some of it in Europe where competition used to be sort of more significant, but also given the requirements around collateral worlds and things like that where you may have at times had marginal participants actually pricing that levels where we would have thought the risk return didnÃÂÃÂt make sense.
Now youÃÂÃÂre seeing more rational and improved pricing IÃÂÃÂd say thatÃÂÃÂs a general trend.
Okay, thanks for taking my questions.
Questions on trading both equities, and fixed income.
And then other things, that are potentially balance sheet consumers like longer dated derivatives swaps and certainly when commodities has picked up, we have seen circumstances where and this is obviously augmented by the fact that their trading houses have gone through some pretty significant pressure now.
What weÃÂÃÂre saying reduce competition, but again itÃÂÃÂs harder to see it certainly translate through unless the client activity levels are high.
It really does sound like there was very significant positive activity in terms of just being able to reduce positions?
I think thatÃÂÃÂs just good practice.
Thanks for taking my questions, Harvey.
Good morning Harvey.
We have a long history obviously managing counterparty exposure, which has been tested through pretty volatile markets and again the most important decision made at any point in time is when you establish that credit line itÃÂÃÂs really no different than lending, but obviously the dynamics are different.

goldmansachs,q4,2015,"I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs' Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio.
Revenues were down slightly compared with last year and expenses were significantly higher due to approximately $4 billion of net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters.
We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including SunGard's $9.1 billion sale to Fidelity National Information Services.
Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $616 million in the fourth quarter down 11% sequentially as debt issuance slowed.
Equity underwriting revenues of $228 million were up 20% compared to the third quarter as IPOs increased from very low levels last quarter.
Debt underwriting revenues decreased 21% to $440 million due to a decline in leveraged finance activity.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter down 23% sequentially and included $54 million of DVA losses.
Excluding DVA, revenues were down 10% quarter-over-quarter as many businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market making conditions.
Interest rate in currencies were lower sequentially as client activity declined.
Mortgages continue to be challenged as spread widened and the prospect for higher rates and client activity remained generally low.
Equities client execution revenues were roughly consistent sequentially at $562 million.
Securities services generated net revenues of $430 million up 13% sequentially.
During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $64 billion to a record $1.25 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity products.
Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remained roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2015 and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 37.5%.
Our global core liquid assets ended the year at $199 billion.
While our balance sheet was roughly flat year-over-year, Level 3 assets declined by 33% to $24 billion.
A glass half full question of this increased volatility across some of the asset classes, using [indiscernible] clients of losing money, but is there any case to be made that [FICC] revenue pie can bottom and actually grow a little bit over the next say two years given the changing monetary landscape things like that monetary policy of landscape?
Your next question's from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.
All right, I suppose over the last few quarters it does look like the market risk assets have been steadily declining.
Your next question's from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities, please go ahead.
In addition, the combination of continued strong performance for our clients and the diversified set of offerings drove a record year for our Investment Management business.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our fixed and equities businesses; net revenues were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down 10% compared to the third quarter.
For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $7.3 billion down 13% year-over-year, where challenging market conditions and lower levels of client activity in our micro businesses, credit and mortgages, offset stronger client activity and a favorable backdrop for our macro businesses, particularly rates and currencies.
In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, flat sequentially and included $14 million in DVA losses.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter.
In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion.
And most importantly we've been able to accomplish these things while maintaining leading positions across all of our businesses, transforming our financial profile, prudently managing our risks, adapting to regulatory change, continuing to invest in our future and positioning the Firm to provide significant operating leverage when the environment improves.
We certainly donÃÂÃÂt control the opportunities set, however we do control several things; how we build our client relationships, how we invest in our people, how we adapt to change, how we allocate our capital, manage our risks and control our costs, and finally, how we invest in the future.
Are we looking at the wrong things meaning, I'm about to ask you your energy exposure and I should be asking you your sovereign exposure to Italian sovereigns or Italian banks like, I'm just curious to your thoughts on where we are besides the market going down?
So, look obviously the first couple of weeks of the year have been difficult from a market perspective and the last half of the year and continuing the dramatic decline in commodity prices broadly has been disruptive for the market.
Look, these things are never going to be a straight line and so it's not surprising to some extent that the markets responding to China, reduced activity volatility in markets this way.
We don't run the businesses for the bull case, but I think that, and there certainly is a bull case in terms of fixed income activity.
So I think as we look forward over the next couple of years, when you start adding in things like the competitive environments.
And then maybe just some thoughts on the incremental operating leverage in the model, I mean the Firm has been very disciplined in expenses despite effectively four years of no top line growth.
So generally speaking, you remember during the course of the year that there was a change to the FASB accounting which was a driver in terms of the NAV and the look through the funds and the other driver obviously, to get back to Christian's question which is as we monetize things they become public equities.
And then just on the expenses, I think you guys you have mentioned, you have done a pretty good job of balancing the investing versus the environment, but just want to get your sense when you think about what you're focused on the regulatory, the IT side that you need to invest versus areas where if we are in weaker markets and activity starts to dry up, where can you pull back on the cost front?
Yeah, so I think -- but from a compensation perspective, compensation is always going to be driven by performance, most importantly at the Firm wide level and then obviously bottoms up from individuals to businesses and through [indiscernible].
Couple of questions, one on I&L again, in the past sometimes you've given us some color on how much has been either realized or mark-to-market and I get the $4 billion on equity component.
So looking at I&L as I said during the quarter, net interest income was really the bulk a driver of the debt line and in terms of I&L relating to non-event driven most of the activity was really event driven or public marks.
Okay and then on a question regarding the stress test, a lot of people thinking out loud about what potential scenarios the Fed could throw at us and I'm just wondering on prior stress tests, are you given full credit for the hedges that you have on in the various asset classes that you're trading in?
So, when we're thinking about the commodity business that you've got, maybe you can talk through a little bit on how your positioned for the trend that we've been seeing here year-to-date?
So, we've been very committed to the commodities franchise and obviously we have a very strong banking franchise and so this is a part of the cycle and I'd say, broadly across commodities where clients are going to be in need of advice, they are going to need capital market solutions, they're going to need potential hedging solutions depending on where they sit in the cost structure or scheme of things.
In commodities -- well just talk commodities in a fixed income context, as I said in my prepared remarks, it's pretty obvious we took share in Investment Banking over the course of the year.
In terms of the FICC activity, it's hard to see it when activity is low but certainly really not in comparison to commodities where activity has been high to us, we've picked up significant share but that's probably not surprising given how much people have pulled resources out of their commodity businesses or least they said, they have over the last couple of years globally.
I think Mike for us, if this translates into somehow, which we don't see today but you never discount any possibility, if this somehow translates into a real drag on a long-term economic activity or economic growth, but as I said before when I was asked the question and it's just an opinion, lots of folks have been on this side of this discussion.
When we talked to our people internally, it feels like the degree to which the market is focused on energy exposures has managed to discount the long term tailwind to the consumer and a reduction in cost across the globe.
Now we were early to the cost cutting because we felt the activity levels declining after 2009 and that's how we managed through the cycle and you've seen us do this in the equity businesses and sometimes these cycles are long.
And then just a follow-up question, since no one's asked it, I'll ask, I know we're only a few weeks into the year and the market backdrop has been, God awful, but how would you characterize activity levels since the beginning of 2016?
Maybe we should talk a little bit about M&A with the volatility that we've seen in the market I think some have been concerned I guess about the impact on M&A I guess both in the near term and what it means to for the cycle?
So, again obviously we had a pretty significant pickup in activity over the last year and Goldman Sachs market share grew dramatically with that.
Given your market share gains in M&A this year, do you get the sense that that's also true with Investment Banking in specifically M&A transactions?
I've obviously heard everything that you have said this morning and I recognize of course that you donÃÂÃÂt run the business to any particular metric ratio, but to the extent that revenue conditions sort of stay as they've been over the past few years and call it around that $34 billion level.
We see growth in parts of our businesses and so where we see growth and where we think we can take share, we're going to invest.
And again, we run the Firm for multiple years and so -- but that's the way I would think about answering the question, but we see opportunities.
And last year, we had dominant market share and tremendous activity levels across the industry.
Revenues might be $34 billion for a couple of years because a lots going on.
So I think look again at its core, we're correlated to long-term economic growth and what we're really seeing in the markets in the second half of the year was really general concerns about economic growth that might be isolated to specific markets but really that's what was driving activity levels.
I think that is a very complicated question which is very difficult for anyone to answer, which is, there's my own view there is not a rule that has had a big impact on market liquidity or lending across industries.
Just a quick question on Investment Management, I mean, you've benefited from a couple of acquisitions there over the last year.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.
The firm's actual results and financial conditions may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio.
Net earnings to common included a $161 million benefit related to the successful tender of our APEX securities.
These concerns translated into significant price pressure at the beginning of the quarter across both equity and fixed income markets.
Global Central Bank activity was front and center again during the quarter.
After raising rates in December for the first time in more than nine years, the market heavily debated the Federal Reserve's future actions.
Within Investment Banking, for example, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes declined by 57% year-over-year.
Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, 5% lower than the fourth quarter as we saw lower client activity across M&A and equity underwriting.
We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including BG Group's ÃÂÃÂ£47 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell; BT Group'sÃÂÃÂ£12.5 billion acquisition of EE Limited; and PETCO Animal Supplies' $4.6 billion sale to a consortium of investors.
Debt underwriting revenues were up 16% to $509 million and benefited from strong investment-grade issuance.
During the first quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Newell Rubbermaid's $8 billion financing to support its acquisition of Jarden, Vista's $4 billion loan and bond offering to support its acquisition of Solera, and Devon Energy's $1.5 billion follow-on offering.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially, as client activity improved in many businesses from weak fourth quarter levels.
This led to a challenging backdrop for our clients with weak investment performance and drove difficult market-making conditions for the firm.
However, activity within currencies declined compared to a strong first quarter of last year.
Mortgages continue to be challenged as spreads widened for some products and client activity remained low.
Higher volatility and global equity market weakness at the beginning of the quarter impacted investor conviction and risk appetite.
Security services generated net revenues of $432 million, up 10% year-over-year on improved spreads.
In equity securities, markdowns on public investments entirely offset net revenues in private investments.
Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $87 million.
Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined by 40% versus the first quarter of 2015.
Our global core liquid assets ended the first quarter at $196 billion and our balance sheet and level 3 assets were $878 billion and $24 billion, respectively.
As we look forward, we are committed to remaining nimble and efficient operators, disciplined capital allocators and prudent risk managers.
Hey, good morning, Glenn.
I'm just curious, are there specific things about your business mix and client mix that doesn't compare as much versus the past in activity levels, things like credit being real slow right now?
And if you feel like any of the balance sheet reductions or Volcker implementation has impacted the forward earnings power?

Hey, good morning.
Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc. And given the regulators' willingness to sacrifice that liquidity to ensure improved safety and soundness, I'm just wondering how that informs your strategy on balance sheet and inventory management?
I have yet to see a very good analysis that breaks down in great detail the impact of negative rates, the fact that we had declining spreads for multiple years that increased asset holdings for mutual funds compared to the shrinkage of bank balance sheets and come up with something that really does a great cost-benefit analysis.
Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc. Well, thank you for taking my questions.
Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Just want to ask the revenue question maybe another way and maybe from the top down.
Just when you think about asset productivity at the firm level or revenues per asset, is it really all about increasing velocity here as client activity hopefully improves?
As you guys think about just further steps that could be taken from here to reduce expenses if the backdrop remains challenging, I know you're always evaluating those, but are we at a point where the focus is really on reducing costs or maybe the footprint in low return areas that would reduce revenues but they'd still have a positive net impact?
Your next question comes from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets.
When do you start thinking about entering new business lines which are radically different from the ones that you're in now under the understanding that you can't get anything more from what you're doing other than waiting for the tide to come in?
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
Moving to Underwriting, net revenues were $692 million in the first quarter, up 4% sequentially as a pickup in debt underwriting more than offset a slowdown in equity issuance.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, up 20% compared to the fourth quarter.
In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, up 1% sequentially.
Net revenues declined 23% year-over-year and reflected the impact of a challenging environment for our clients and the firm.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $87 million in the first quarter.
In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion.
During the quarter, management and other fees were down 6% sequentially to $1.2 billion due to a change in the mix of client assets and strategies.
In conclusion, the first quarter was obviously a difficult period for our clients, the markets and our opportunity set.
I think when you look at the year-over-year, obviously, we had a very strong first quarter 2015 relative to the peer set.
And then, more importantly, for the equity dynamic going forward, like maybe size the portfolio fair value versus cost basis, see if there are any marks in the quarter that, knock on wood don't repeat next quarter?
In terms of the equity line, both private and public, basically the public portfolio was down roughly $140 million during the quarter and that was offset by private marks.
I know in any given quarter it's kind of tough on, I think, the market share standpoint, but I feel like when revenues are weak you can't really tell market share and then when revenues rebound, you can figure out who gained and who lost.
In terms of the longer-term observation around the competitive dynamic, again, in a quarter like this, hard to see it when our clients are experiencing such volatility and such stress, but I think based on announcements and parts of the business where we're seeing client flows move, engagement with clients is quite good and we're getting good feedback.
So I think a quarter like we just had actually only makes the competitor forward look better, but we'll see.
When you look at what has happened through the quarter and the rebound in the markets, I'm trying to just gauge on the parts of the business that are as simple as markets are up and so you should start to see some improving trends versus maybe on like the I&L, you mentioned the provision on the debt side.
Can you just talk a bit about the disconnect between the markets, the improvement that we're seeing there and what still feels like sluggish client activity, maybe better than January/February, but here's the S&P up a couple percent year-to-date, credit spreads have tightened.
I guess the question is, like, is it a timing issue where we need more stability for activity to pick up in a bigger way, or is it the underlying economy's not strong enough?
But I think after a tough first quarter like the whole market has experienced, I think that there may be a slow reaction function in terms of how various market participants engage the marketplace.
I think generally I would agree with your statement over very long periods of time, but I think in terms of the M&A cycle that we're in now, while off a little bit from the levels of 2015, the level of dialogue there feels quite good.
And then just separately on expenses, obviously good cost control in a tough revenue quarter.
We've talked about it a lot, that this is a performance-driven culture, and the performance wasn't great in the first quarter and as a result you saw compensation and benefits expense down 40% year-over-year.
If you think about the things we've done over the last couple of years, since the middle of 2013 we've taken the ICS balance sheet down 25% and FICC RWAs, market and credit down 30%.
You've danced pretty well the last three to four years without revenue growth, but it seems like you're getting to the end of what you can do and your return on equity is now in the single-digit range, and I think consensus has it in the single-digit range for the year.
I think you're right to point out that for four years running we are one of the very small handful of firms that have had double-digit ROEs. This is a quarter, I certainly wouldn't sit here and tell you, we are happy about this quarter, but we will do what it takes over time to make sure that we deliver for our clients and maximize the returns for our shareholders in a prudent way.
Goldman is obviously a leader in applying technology to traditional voice trading businesses and other things, and you've been pretty vocal in the past about how you transformed equities, and foreign exchange, and cut head count while picking up market share and the process.
But it feels like we're in an evolution where obviously clients are looking for efficiencies and we're looking for efficiencies, but the reality is that a vast majority of the fixed income market is more bespoke; it won't lend itself to that.
So, is it right though, for us to think that there is going to be a significant transformation in the cost structure and the capital structure that you apply to FICC over the next couple of years?
Well I think, look, you've seen some of the evolutionary steps we've taken in terms of the balance sheet reductions and the risk-weighted assets that I talked about earlier.
It may be the case that over periods of time, depending on how much client activity there is, but the extent to which it shifts to electronic channels like we've seen under the regulatory framework for swap execution facilities, those transitions happen very, very quickly, and we adjust very, very quickly.
So I would say with respect to the liquidity dynamic, if I had to rank factors and it's very hard to quantify these things, I would say factors like conviction around the markets because of the sharp decline in the oil price and obviously the negative interest rate environment and the big shift to, as you said, the buy-side holding lots of assets, I think those are as significant a driver in the current environment as is regulation, given that banks are holding less inventory globally.
I think that underpinning all of that is that when you look at the client base, regardless of how much velocity may be in their current trading activities quarter-to-quarter, the core needs in terms of their need for liquidity and our desire to provide it, that remains.
I would say that, look, the space has been under extreme stress which emerged over a fairly short period of time, measured more in months than years, and so I think our expectation that there will be active dialogue across the industry.
On trading broadly, thinking about the importance of hedge funds to your trading business, should we temper our expectations for a bounce back here in your revenues, even if we see some market improvement, given the pressure that that client base has experienced this year?
So, look, we think of all of our clients as important, but obviously, we've had a big commitment to the hedge fund industry across equities and fixed them for a long time.
Because in periods like we went through in the first quarter, obviously, they have a tendency to derisk and it reduces trading velocity over many months, although it may be, for example, an active day from time to time.
Could you maybe help us out a little bit on, number one, how we could see ÃÂÃÂ I think you indicated in the press release that sequentially down quarter-over-quarter on the backlog.
Versus the end of the year, as we would imagine, given what happened in the equity markets, the equity backlog is up and obviously we had a bit of an outperformance, it looks like, versus the rest of the industry on debt underwriting, and that's down sequentially.
So I think ÃÂÃÂ look, you have to give the regulators a lot of credit over the last several years for making ÃÂÃÂ and I'll focus more on the U.S. financial system, including things like CCAR.
Well, I think if you go back to history, even ignoring the recent regulatory changes that both clients and market providers participated in, if you go back to some of the formation of Tradeweb back into the early 2000s, I think all of those vehicles, and there may have always been challenges at the start, whether it's TRACE reporting or Tradeweb or things like that.
Guess I'm curious as to how you're thinking about the pre-tax margin in that business over the relatively near-term, say the next 12 to 18 months?
I know it's fluid, but just trying to think about the size of really proactive opportunities to improve asset productivity by changing the balance sheet mix outside of just a pickup in client activity?
I was wondering, if we take as a given that your balance sheet is in pristine condition and that you're the very best, or among the very best in each one of the businesses in which you operate, we run up against a situation that the world has changed dramatically so that we are now nine years into Goldman Sachs not being able to come close to what it did in 2007.
So, look, at this stage, it's our best estimate, Marty, in terms of where we think the year will go.
The other thing which I know is a hard question to be able to answer, but it's kind of important when you start thinking about just what are the core earnings and trying to take out some of the volatility that happens from quarter to quarter.
You have to go back to the third quarter of 2011 or back to other periods where markets have been extremely volatile to see this kind of performance.

goldmansachs,q2,2016,"Good morning, my name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today.
I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2016 Earnings conference call.
IÃÂÃÂll walk you through the second quarter results, then IÃÂÃÂm happy to answer any questions.
This was also reflected in equity markets; for example, the S&P 500 was relatively unchanged for most of April and May. In addition, we saw sequential improvements in global investment banking volumes.
Investment banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, 22% higher than the first quarter as we saw increased client activity across equity and debt underwriting.
We advised a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including NorthStar Asset ManagementÃÂÃÂs $16.9 billion tri-party merger with Colony Capital and NorthStar Realty Finance; Great Plains EnergyÃÂÃÂs $12.2 billion acquisition of Westar Energy, and Hewlett Packard EnterprisesÃÂÃÂ $8.5 billion spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corporation.
Debt underwriting revenues were up 42% to $724 million and benefited from asset-backed issuance and strong leveraged finance activity.
During the second quarter, we actively supported our clientsÃÂÃÂ financing needs, participating in MylanÃÂÃÂs $6.5 billion investment-grade offering to support its acquisition of Meda AB; U.S. FoodsÃÂÃÂ $1.2 billion IPO; and the approximately ÃÂÃÂ850 million IPO of Philips Lighting.
Equities client execution net revenues of $587 million were up 25% sequentially.
Better market making conditions for most of the quarter and select corporate activity drove improved performance.
Securities services generated net revenues of $422 million, down 2% relative to the first quarter as seasonally stronger client activity was offset by slightly lower customer balances and spreads.
Equities securities generated net revenues of $626 million primarily reflecting company-specific events, sales, and gains in public equity investments.
Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $485 million and included more than $250 million of net interest income.
Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Hey, good morning Glenn.
Hey, good morning Christian.
Yes, itÃÂÃÂs an unsecured consumer loan product.
Thanks, good morning.
Good morning, Harvey.
Good morning, Harvey.
Can you just help me understand - when you say $700 million of run rate savings, from what level and under what revenue circumstances?
Yes, given where weÃÂÃÂre running now, I would say something just shy of 30 feels like a better expectation where we stand right now.
Hey, good morning Harvey.
Is thatÃÂÃÂyou know, as we talked about double counting and SIFI possibly going into CCAR, it looks like you got a break on operational risk that almost equals your SIFI charge almost exactly.
ThatÃÂÃÂs all other factors being equal going into 2017, and this year that will translate roughly into $350 million of savings this year.
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures thatÃÂÃÂs posed on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $993 million in the second quarter, up 43% sequentially as capital markets activity picked up from the first quarter.
This was up significantly compared to weak activity in the first quarter due to an increase in IPOs. Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.7 billion in the second quarter, up 7% compared to the first quarter.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, up 16% sequentially as market making conditions improved in many businesses from the first quarter.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.1 billion in the second quarter.
Now, after severance that number is going to be more like 350 this year, but obviously weÃÂÃÂre staying very focused on this and I think you see that performance has been down, and with that compensation and benefits expenses down 28% year-to-date.
Then your comment on the investment banking pipelineÃÂÃÂs down, IÃÂÃÂm just curious, how much of that is just off of great numbers and as you execute, including the debt underwriting that you talked about, and then versus how much does Brexit play a role in just kind of slowing things down on deals that might have been happening across Europe?
So when you look at the backlog, I think one way to look at it is the year-over-year, so if youÃÂÃÂre actually standing here at the end of June last year, obviously the second quarter and first half of last year were very dynamic.
In terms of Brexit, where we sit today, given I think that the base case expectation is that the dynamic is going to play out over a long period of time, and in some respects it may contribute to some of the same factors that contributed to a very active M&A environment, other than maybe very specific transactions that are geographic in nature, that are really driven by geography, which is generally few, when we talk to our bankers, if we continue in this low growth environment, they donÃÂÃÂt feel sitting here today that Brexit is going to be a headwind but obviously itÃÂÃÂs going to be a dynamic situation.
ThereÃÂÃÂs a whole host of processes through which we go through in terms of how employees elect to get compensated, et cetera, so thatÃÂÃÂs an issue obviously we monitor very closely in terms of our foreign currency risk broadly across the globe, managing a global business, but I wouldnÃÂÃÂt point to that as a significant consideration, although itÃÂÃÂs a consideration of the many things we look at.
Going into Brexit, client activity tapered off, but at the point of Brexit and potentially thereafter in a number of our businesses, we either near-peak volumes or peak volumes, or new peaks, so that was quite good to see.
In terms of the longer term perspective on Brexit, as I said before, this looks like this process is going to take a while, and weÃÂÃÂre hopeful, along with everyone else, that the parties that are engaged in these negotiations will be prudent and thoughtful because obviously itÃÂÃÂs good for all of us, a thoughtful negotiation and outcome will just be good for economic growth.
So one of the drivers in this quarter, as I referenced, was an asset-backed related activity, and there was one significant transaction where earlier on, we had committed capital to purchase a portfolio, which ultimately translated through in the debt underwriting line that would not be included in a lead table, so itÃÂÃÂd be difficult for you to see.
First, just on the G-SIB surcharge, just wanted to get an update where you stand, and then probably more importantly when you think of wanting to reduce that versus taking advantage of opportunities to take market share, just given some of the exits that weÃÂÃÂve seen throughout the industry, just want to get a sense on where youÃÂÃÂre at and kind of the pullback versus the growth, just given some of the dislocations out there with some of the competitors.
We believe that and all firms obviously should make that a priority; but youÃÂÃÂre right to say that as the competitive environment is shifting and a number of our competitors have stated restructuring plans, we want to make sure that in all of our efforts, whether itÃÂÃÂs managing our capital, that weÃÂÃÂre focused on costs, that we remain full service across all of our businesses and weÃÂÃÂre there for our clients.
So with CCAR, I know you guys donÃÂÃÂt disclose what youÃÂÃÂre going to do, but just from a quarter as we kind of go through the third quarter through 2017, should we expect the same type of ramp that we saw last year just in terms of the lighter up front and then the heavier buybacks as that plays out?
So whatÃÂÃÂs expected of CCAR and the CCAR process, obviously you say the 11.1 million shares this quarter and the 1.7 billion-plus in dollar buybacks, so last yearÃÂÃÂs test had some idiosyncrasies in it which led to this profile where, to the extent of which and we ended up using capacity that weÃÂÃÂre repurchasing, that we were more constrained in the early quarters versus the later quarters.
In terms of theÃÂÃÂI think what youÃÂÃÂre asking, the question really relates to the harvesting in the funds.
Could you talk a little bit more about investment management in terms of why the fees were so weak there, say, versus a year ago?
So the biggest driver in the quarter when you look year-over-year is obviously the incentive fees, and thatÃÂÃÂs reflective of the environment and incentive fees from time to time are going to be lumpy.
So as you know, in the business obviously we have a number of different client segments so itÃÂÃÂs full service across a number of different lines.
But just more broadly speaking, maybe give us an update on where you are on the lending thought process overall, and then on the deposit side as well, I think you did the brand conversion of the deposit acquisition this past quarter.
IÃÂÃÂve emphasizedÃÂÃÂyou know, weÃÂÃÂve emphasized a number of times that weÃÂÃÂre going to be very deliberate and slow with this, so weÃÂÃÂve developed one product which we plan to launch later this fall, so thatÃÂÃÂs where we stand [indiscernible] over the next several months.
We, as you know, like sometimesÃÂÃÂsometimes I think that because we donÃÂÃÂt announce targets in advance, that people misunderstand a bit about the way we run the business.
I just wanted to return first of all to the capital management question and maybe ask it a little bit differently in terms of what we might expect over the next several quarters.
Should we be thinking in terms of that 5% run rate, or maybe a couple of percentage points higher in line with what youÃÂÃÂve done recently?
Now, the second things we do and the strength of the financial footings of the firm, obviously youÃÂÃÂve seen us do a huge amount of work and you see it reflected in our ratios with 13.7 standardized at the end of this quarter.
Ultimately, that gives you the flexibility to either return it or not, and thatÃÂÃÂs why youÃÂÃÂve seen the uptick over the past couple of years in terms of levels of activity.
This actually turns out to be a related question - you caveated in the release that the environment for FICC continues to be pretty challenging because of low rates and volumes and low client activity, which implies that there is a more normal run rate that you think is achievable.
You know, Guy, IÃÂÃÂd say that first in terms of client activity levels and run rate, if you will, run rate is a difficult thing but I donÃÂÃÂt think anyone would disagree that when you look at the trading activity levels and the industry trends over the last couple years, obviously theyÃÂÃÂve been in decline.
When you look at the factors in terms of our clients and what they need, our clients are still there and they still need those services, they need them from us, and so the type of environment weÃÂÃÂve been in, if you actually look at the sort ofÃÂÃÂfor lack of better language, the violence of the first quarter in January and February, and then the concerns about Brexit in the second quarter, I think itÃÂÃÂs fair for us to say these feel like low levelsÃÂÃÂthese are the type of factors that contribute to reduced client sentiment, reduced confidence, and as a result reduced activity.
So when volumes pick up, we feel like we see it, but itÃÂÃÂs difficult for me to tell you what the run rate will be over a long period of time, given the dynamic nature of markets and the unique place we find ourselves with respect to global growth and interest rates.
So can you elaborate a little bit on those metrics, even though I recognize it was just for a short period of time, but the metrics that told you that you were picking up market share, because up until now when weÃÂÃÂve asked you that question, youÃÂÃÂve generally said itÃÂÃÂs still hard to measure, itÃÂÃÂs early days, youÃÂÃÂre not really going to be able to tell in this kind of environment.
So with respect to [indiscernible] client services, thatÃÂÃÂs just reflective of activity levels, and as markets were volatile in the first and second quarter, you saw that translate through with respect to demand, market prices and spreads, so thereÃÂÃÂs nothing really to highlight there other than its reflective of the environment.
In terms of the client base and our client footings, weÃÂÃÂre always looking to grow our market share across all segments, across all regions, and so we continue to focus on that and thereÃÂÃÂs always things we can do better.
Okay, weÃÂÃÂll move onto the next question, and thatÃÂÃÂs from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
No, I think thatÃÂÃÂs maybe just reflective of different product lines that businesses may have.
Yes, I think thatÃÂÃÂs a reasonable question in terms of just the unique nature of Brexit.
ItÃÂÃÂs interesting how the worldÃÂÃÂso the market reaction, the activity level right around Brexit obviously I donÃÂÃÂt think was surprising to any of us.
I think that may be a little bit different, to go back to the core of your question about things weÃÂÃÂve seen in the past, so this normalization was so quick that it actually may be something thatÃÂÃÂs a better harbinger in the near term usually following one of these events for activity levels.
If we stay in this low growth environment, unless something is really uniquely impacted by Brexit and if the negotiation process takes a long period of time, then as I said, our bankers donÃÂÃÂt necessarily see this being a headwind.
I think the answer is itÃÂÃÂs just too early to tell in terms of how this process was going to unfold.
I think when you were walking through INL, you said that NII was around $250 million or so, so if weÃÂÃÂre run rating that at about $1 billion, when we look at your INL balance sheet in the Q and just using the last quarterÃÂÃÂs numbers because I doubt theyÃÂÃÂre that different, if we sum up the debt and loans, you get to about $70 billion or so, just over, which is a little over a 1% net yield.
If there are opportunities and client demand in investing and lending, which tend to be longer term commitments of capital, obviously we engage in those also, but we donÃÂÃÂt allocate down a capital in a way that says, okay, hereÃÂÃÂs your capital Mr. and Mrs. Business, you use that, weÃÂÃÂll see you in a year.
I know thatÃÂÃÂs been debated for some time, but do you have any sense as to what form that proposal might take and whether it could compel any changes in terms of how you strategically manage that business?
WeÃÂÃÂll have to see what ultimately the rules look like, but obviously weÃÂÃÂre very committed to those clients.
We continually review all the businesses to ensure that weÃÂÃÂre maintaining the right footprint, so this is all about making sure that we find the right balance between our commitment to clients over the long term and expense management, and obviously the first half of this year has not been the greatest environment, so youÃÂÃÂre just seeing us respond to it.
The other thing I was going to ask you was on this quarter and the headcount reductions, where the severance costs would probably hit, when you look at kind of dividing it, if you just said well, youÃÂÃÂre at full run rate in the second quarter, which I know you probably werenÃÂÃÂt, but $175 million per quarter, and then you look at the net for the year youÃÂÃÂre talking about for this year of being 350 net severance then being possible $350 million, I was trying to think of the timing in relation to the gains in the sense of the expense savings and how that might have affected the second quarter.

goldmansachs,q3,2016,"I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
I'll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results and am happy to answer any questions.
Investment banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, 14% lower than a strong second quarter.
Breaking down the components of investment banking in the quarter, advisory revenues were $658 million down 17% compared to the second quarter as industry-wide completed activity declined.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.7 billion in the third quarter up 2%compared to the second quarter.
FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter up 2% sequentially.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.4 billion in the third quarter.
On expenses, last quarter we discussed the $700 million savings initiative that we undertook in the first half of the year and we continue to look at additional means of improving our efficiency without impacting our global client franchise.
While there are currently economic headwinds in several countries globally, our focus on efficiency across all of our businesses and regions allows the firm not only to maintain, but also to invest in our client franchise through the cycle.
I'm just curious when you look at the quarter we just had in FICC particularly, is it more like you had a nice pickup like first quarter of '15 and you're setting this up for keep calm like things have returned back to normal or is this possibly a little bit higher activity environment given the uncertainty?
I think in some respects that speaks to a weaker third quarter environment last year, but I have to agree with you.
You talked about some company-specific events, some sales and the up markets, but I guess the question is, is are you finding opportunities that will also put money to work especially on the equity side.
When you see it again this quarter it is going to close to 80% debt, but selectively we're certainly seeing opportunities whether they be in what we recall other forms of equity, real estate or other areas, but selectively we've seen some good opportunities in corporate equity.
So a question on your consumer lending efforts, given the firm will be facing a very different demographic than you have historically faced, may we just talk about how you think about reputational risks and how you mitigate it?
This year, we had a bit of flexibility in terms of how we'll approach the next couple of quarters, but a lot of this i6s going to be driven by edging out the environment and demand for the balance sheet.
You know how we think about capital management, and share repurchase for us is not to be equated with dividends and so it's going to be dynamic.
In terms of the stress testing, white paper and govern it relates comments I'd say at a high level, obviously, they put a ton of work into this with various constituencies.
So we manage the firm obviously on the forward-looking basis in terms of how we stress tests.
But I think our starting point puts us in a great position and again the treatment of share repurchase and we'll see what happens with balance sheet and other things.
When you look at some of the things that the Fed has put out there on physical commodities and some of the pressures on that part of the market versus what you guys have been doing on the debt side, just where do you see the outlook based on maybe some of these potential changes, the increase in RWAs?
As you know, we've been in the commodity business for decades, and we think it's really important that the Federal ReserveÃÂÃÂs taken the lead here in terms of an important area of focus for us in the industry, but especially as it relates to ultimately establishing uniform standards across the industry.
Because as I step back and look at some of the names I cover, there seems like it could be one of the meaningful new initiatives that's out there in terms of change in the profile the company a little bit, and I think more disclosures over time will be helpful to be able to track the performance.
And that in terms of return for long term, if that's kind of where you're getting, obviously, I talked a lot bit about the consumer here but we built this business to be accretive in the long run to Goldman Sachs returns.
Did you see some of the benefit of share gains this quarter as part of your capital markets revenue?
So with respect to the market share, certainly over the course of the past year, I would say there's been periods, particularly things like some of our core strengths, Prime Brokerage in fixed income, across the regions, we've seen discrete shifts in market share.
I would say when we look at it in terms of the core businesses, for example, like credit, as we monitor those market shares, certainly with certain client segments like asset managers, it feels like we're picking up market share.
We told you forever that as a conceptual matter, you should expect in periods where revenues should decline that compensation and benefits expense should lag that and obviously, we talked to you ton about operating leverage.
I would say that Brexit potentially is something that could drive share to the U.S. I think what we've witnessed over the last several years is U.S. firms like ourselves with really, really strong market shares and leading business positions whether you look at FICC, investment banking, equities, asset management, if you're a leader in a franchise throughout this cycle, particularly as activity picks up, I think there is share to gain.
And I look at this and I'm thinking is there an opportunity for you to allocate a little bit more in this environment and continue to generate some nice sized trading revenues?
I think what's most important about that observation is just the capacity we have under the capital ratios, so obviously.
Obviously, corporate private equity has been slow over the last couple of years, but that $21.5 million 20% of that now is made up of real estate globally.
The assets have been performing, the markets have been generally going up over the last couple of years and you've seen that performance as I&L segment.
I guess the other question, also I&L-related is, and had this has to do with the negative operating leverage comment that you had made for the Firm broadly.
About pricing you mentioned -- we talked about market share, but have you seen given that some banks putting less capital to work than others, any impact on pricing in any of your products, and there is the follow-up as well on the tax rate now that is coming lower again what are you thinking about for the future?
But again in this low volume environment I donÃÂÃÂt know how much that you will see, in other words, the same low volume, low growth environment we have globally that's contributing to what it looks like in the future extraordinarily strong competitive environment for our businesses is the same thing that doesnÃÂÃÂt allow for lot of price improvements.
And so I think these one of your things where even though it has taken while you need environment that is challenge for a while or to get competitors retreats of the same challenges donÃÂÃÂt allow for price adjustments, it maybe overtime you see price adjustments, but certainly things the more capital intensive parts of the business like prime brokerage where we are market leader.
Maybe just a question on Asia I guess in a more positive way, you have the Hong Kong, Shanghai connect going into place later this year, it seems like when the Hong Kong Shanghai connect went in you guys had a nice boost in equity trading the industry did in the first half of 2015.
I think more broadly, well it might not be a straight path to increasing volumes, I think more broadly in Asia our perspective is and with China that we are on a long upward trajectory of activity and our role and ability to work with clients in the region, whether its trading, advisory, capital raising, this just feels like a very long positive trajectory, but itÃÂÃÂs not going to be straight line.
But the activity levels that I mentioned in terms of completed transactions in the market, obviously down over year after very, very healthy levels.
So it does feel like we are starting now again into a market where a lot of that activity that got pushed from the first quarter into the second quarter that that still exists.
So we feel reasonably good about activity levels in the capital markets on an intermediate basis.
Now in terms of the fund size, we have been talking about $5 billion to $8 billion, thatÃÂÃÂs what the team feels is the right size for the horizon that they are thinking about.
I think you commented that the quarter wasn't a particularly strong one, even though the year-over-year growth was good.
But just thinking about the strategy for this business, longer term, looking at the activities more broadly, it's been a very good profit source, historically, but it also consumes significant amounts of capital.
So I think you're right to underscore, which I mentioned earlier, the fact that over time, the CCAR requirements under -- let's just use private equity investing and corporate equity have certainly increased.
But as I mentioned before, one of the nice things about launching this fund is it does gives us flexibility in terms of how to think about deploying that capital and it creates a new important product for our clients.
But to the extent to which I think at this stage whether you look at the supplementary leverage ratio, standardized, advanced, we have the tools in place through our return on attributed equity framework, the ROE framework, which we talked a lot about.
And the team has done a very good job in their advisory businesses and so that I would say would be the more meaningful part of the driver in terms of this quarter's flows.
We focus on the clients in those businesses where, as you know, we have leading market positions and so we feel good about that.
But a lot of the things are outside of our control and I would say that in aggregate, when you look at the vast majority of our businesses, this is not an extraordinary environment, despite the fact that third quarter performance was strong on a relative basis, there's lots of challenges regionally.
I would say that broadly speaking, and this won't be completely inclusive, but I think you can define our technology strategy as focused on client engagement and those tools and services we can deliver to clients that provide differentiated value to those clients, and you see that doing us in our capital markets businesses and obviously you see us creating that with Marcus.
As you know, you've been following us forever in terms of broadly speaking and it may not be the case in any given year.
Ultimately a more favorable backdrop and improved client sentiment translated into year-over-year revenue growth in three of our four business segments.
Although revenues declined sequentially, our investment banking backlog remained robust and was up versus last quarter.
We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including ARM holdings ÃÂÃÂ£24.4 billion sale to Softbank Group.
Equity underwriting revenues were $227 million down 16% compared to the second quarter due to a continued weak backdrop for equity issuance.
During the third quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs, participating in Postal Savings Bank of China's $7.4 billion IPO, Great Plains Energy's $2.5 billion follow-on and convertible offering to support its purchase of Westar and Fortis' $2 billion investment grade offering for the purchase of ITC.
Rates was down slightly as client activity was driven by the continued discussion around potential Central Bank actions.
Equities client execution net revenues of $678 million were up 16% sequentially, reflecting better market-making conditions.
Security services generated net revenues of $387 million down 8% relative to the seasonally stronger second quarter.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $920 million, reflecting company-specific events, sale and gains in public equity investments.
Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $478 million and included approximately $275 million of net interest income.
Long-term fee-based net inflows of $14 billion were primarily driven by fixed-income products.
All of these actions, combined with more than $30 billion of earnings since 2011, position the firm to grow our capital ratios and simultaneously bring our basic share count to its lowest point ever.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
And then completely unrelated, any color on the regional performance within fixed income trading this quarter?
Yes, I think that there was some -- there was -- before the commodities NPR came out the fed had also I think made some noises about asking for congressional guidance I guess on cutting back on merchant banking that's allowed within broker.
Yes. Brennan Hawken
Hey Harvey, Wanted to start off with just a follow-up question relating to the earlier merchant banking discussion.
It is quite evident that you have made significant strides in mitigating your standardized RWAs. But the advanced risk rated assets have actually crept higher.
Yes. We will adapt if needed but right now we feel we have more than enough capacity.
Good morning Harvey.
Good morning Harvey.
Yes, thanks very much.
Hi Harvey, actually I'm all good.
Yes. Do you feel like you could put deposits maybe in asset management?
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
",48.47,0.511842
goldmansachs,q4,2016,"Okay, now letÃÂÃÂs walk through the fourth quarter and full year results then Marty and I are happy to answer any questions.
Switching to the back half of the year, the global economic outlook improved reflecting solid economic reports particularly in the U.S. As a result, net revenues in the back half of the 2016 increased by nearly 16% year-over-year and included two consecutive quarter of 11 plus percent returns on equity.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter down slightly compared to the third quarter.
FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the fourth quarter, up slightly quarter-over-quarter as many businesses benefited from increased client activity.
In equities, which include equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion down 11% sequentially.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter.
This quarter, we obviously had the election and a couple other events and things went bonkers, but it feels very different to me and more permanent and client needs are changing and we have monetary policy diversion, so I'm leaving the witness here, but does it feel different to you guys and does that equate to this could be the first year in many that the fixed income fee pull could grow?
I would say you could look at our fourth quarter, but I think itÃÂÃÂd be better to look really at the second half of the year and what we saw from clients in the second half of the year was basically a build of confidence and expectation that we might see stronger fiscal policy, divergence of interest rates that we weren't heading into a deflationary cycle more confidence about economic growth, and so I would say there was increased optimism around the world.
Just wanted to get a sense depending on what potential changes happened with policy and regulation, is there some way to give us some context on the amount that has been spent whether it's on regulation, compliance, technology it maybe since 2011, 2012 that could either shift around depending on the outlook, obviously thereÃÂÃÂs a lot of core and thatÃÂÃÂs going to stay in place, but just wanted to get a sense on what that increase has been despite you guys imaging the overall expense base well?
I think the thing that we've been able to do is as we've invested and as weÃÂÃÂve comply with the rules, we never be use technology and training across the teams to be as efficient as possible which is why this year you would have seen that non-compensation expense was the lowest expense since 2007 and we were able to also execute the $900 million run rate savings, but who knows where weÃÂÃÂll end up in terms of the rule set, but obviously weÃÂÃÂll always look to comply and comply in the most efficient way possible over time.
It's been a while since we've been in an environment or people may more positive on like the growth outlook, and just wanted to get a sense and this is somewhat Glenn's question and you answer it, but maybe broader on trading and banking.
What do you guys look at in terms of seeing that pick up in client engagement, I know you mentioned the IB pipeline is up quarter-over-quarter but even on trading in terms of balances, investment management maybe inflows, just wanted to get some sense on how we can kind of see the follow through or the impact of better economy in that translating into in a stronger revenues?
Look the thing that informs us the most is the work that all of our people do whether they are in banking, asset management, whether they are in equities or fixed income all around the globe engage with their clients every day.
And as you know over the past several years thereÃÂÃÂs been a general sense of concern with respect to global growth that was reinforced by a lot of the monitory policy around the world.
Just give us some of the increased optimism that youÃÂÃÂve talked about on this call and the pipelines, just kind of big picture, how do you think differently about staffs, call it how much you lean forward versus trying to optimize, itÃÂÃÂs like a last several years you and the industry have been focused on optimizing to kind of lower pool of revenues got for regulatory environment.
This is the first change since the announcement about Gary Cohn, so you know Harvey, how do you kind of approach your new position and then for Marty, how does your past experience you know help you or maybe present a challenge for you in the CFO role going from CIO to CFO is somewhat unique?
I would say the following I think if rates continue to rise and itÃÂÃÂs a reflection of optimism and concerns around deflation abate and concerns around economic decline debate and they are replaced with expectations of economic growth and activity and confidence and client sentiment continues to shift.
I think you are right to say that obviously industrials are representative but itÃÂÃÂs very idiosyncratic and a year like this where equity issuance is down.
And this reflects a couple of things, obviously the performance weÃÂÃÂve delivered to the clients but I do think itÃÂÃÂs the nature of the capabilities that have built over a number of years.
So quick question, I know itÃÂÃÂs been touched on a couple of times, but itÃÂÃÂs one thatÃÂÃÂs definitely I think front of investorÃÂÃÂs minds here, so hopefully you donÃÂÃÂt mind me touch it on it again.
I think itÃÂÃÂs very difficult to quantify just like it was difficult to quantify in 2012, 2013, 2014 how concerns around deflation and low economic growth will impact activity in a number of businesses.
It seems like up taking comp ratio in ÃÂÃÂ16 was probably more of a revenue story, so want to confirm thatÃÂÃÂs true and then when we think about maybe the other side of that blade or the other blade of that knife if we start to see revenue environment improve, how should we think about operating leverage at Goldman given all of the work that youÃÂÃÂve done on the expense front which youÃÂÃÂve talked about a couple of times?
Obviously over the last several years, whether itÃÂÃÂs around expenses, de-risking the firm and growing the capital ratios, returning the capital all that work has really been about positioning the firm, while at the same time obviously maintaining all of our connectivity to clients with really, really significant operating leverage.
There were a handful of transactions thatÃÂÃÂs itÃÂÃÂs always going to be the case in a marking making business when you are providing liquidity to clients that could have an impact that was the case this quarter.
Got it, and then a much broader question, I know you donÃÂÃÂt like to set ROE targets but I was wondering if in the context of what you might call for example unshackled interest rate sort of in a post QE environment and more broadly some other things that we talked about in terms of the new administrations goals and expectations thereof, can you speak to a realistic but aspiration ROE?
We run the business through thoughtful and efficient deployment of capital managing expenses and making sure we have the best people and weÃÂÃÂre focused on our clients.
Maybe just talk about the revenue side of regulatory change, I know it's not an easy question to answer, but I think there's been a lot of I guess hope and talk about sort of an easing of regulation what that could mean on the revenue side.
So I don't know if there's a way to just sort of talk about it generally in terms of where do you see the most constraints right now and what would potentially benefit you the most whether it's easing of market making rules, whether it's some changes like we saw in the UK around exempting cash from the leverage ratio, if you could help that would be great?
I think what we've seen and one of the things I think gets lost in the global dialog around regulation is that you know eight years past the crisis, the body of work that's been created by the regulators whether it's Basel capital ratios, the implementation of CCAR, stress testing broadly globally, the leverage ratios, the requirements around liquidity, all those things that were designed to address points to systemic risk, clearing, margin requirements, all of that data reporting, I think sometimes gets lost in the narrative and have to step back and look at the past eight years and realize that and itÃÂÃÂs a credible body of work that regulators, the industry participants and the clients have actually created.
I think long - I think the dialog around regulation and whether or not there should be some degree of pause and stepping back, I think that started really at the beginning of last year maybe a little bit before you saw some of that in the Basel Committee across the second half of the year, and obviously I think market participants regulators and also it seems like a very reasonable point in time to step back and assess we obviously have gotten some great benefits out of the regulation and the question is, is there a cost in economic growth.
In terms of liquidity, I think it's fair to say that feedback from clients and itÃÂÃÂs not reason it's happened over the last several years across the industry.
I think this activity picks up and volume begins volume you get improvements in liquidity, but every day we come in the door and we're offering our balance sheet, our clients in the best possible way that we can.
Okay and then I guess maybe as a follow up to that, I mean to the extent I guess I'd say consensus expectations build in two or three rate hikes a year, at what point does that become you know the kind of catalyst that you talked about in relation to commodities for activity?
Those were all positive catalysts what they'll be like quarter-to-quarter very difficult, but again coming out of eight years of declining interest rates, I think would - none of us really wanted to get used to that.
So I have follow up just to Jim's earlier question, specifically on tax policy and a comments Harvey that you made on M&A, you said that you view the changes really as more of a timing issue, but one of the constraints that we've been hearing from a lot of folks, is that efforts to broaden the tax base might in fact include restrictions on interest expense deductibility and could increase financing costs and reduce appetite for future debt.
Understood and maybe just sticking to changes in the GOP regime and the implications I could have, but focusing more on the regulatory side there's been a lot of discussion on the prospects of possible repeal or less strict enforcement of Volcker, and Harvey I know you touched on some of the change in terms of just broader messaging, but it just remains to be seen how that might impact your business, I know it's a little bit early, but I just want to get a sense as to if we do see an explicit repeal of Volcker how that would change your strategy, not just on the trading side, but would it in fact how you deploy capital within INL as well?
I think most of the discussion around will go over the last several years by regulators and industry participants and clients going back to the earlier question is what impact has it had on market making capabilities across the industry, which is obviously the most important part of our business we're providing liquidity to our clients.
We would take a look at it, if it changed in terms of our activities, proprietary trading we haven't been in that business in a long time, it was never a material driver and so we would look at it and whatever in the best interest of our clients and our shareholders that's how we evaluate it just like we devaluate any rule change.
The good thing about that is it gives us a lots of capacity, and it goes back to when we talk about operating leverage sure it's about expenses it's about capital, but it's positioning the firm in a way that we can respond to an uptick.
But I would wish it for Marty over the years ahead that if he had the chance to deploy capital back to our clients not to return as much to shareholders grow risk weighted assets that actually with the firm has done for the vast majority of the firms history and those are the environments that you know we thrive in and so it was Marty and I'd pass the baton over the next couple of months, I'm hoping he gets to deploy the capital in that way with all of us across the firm.
Well maybe I'll kick off and then I'll turn over to Marty and he can talk more specifically about technology, but I wouldn't say there's been a lack of investment in, I think the way you described it some of the other growth areas, right.
And then within DCM just coming back to some other questions you know had a really terrific year there obviously if the M&A backdrop improves from here that it could be supportive, on the other hand you know higher interest rates you see like my constrain some issuance, I know there is a lot of puts and takes.
You know the debt component of the backlog continues to growth, thatÃÂÃÂs a necessarily forecast this year but the level of client engagement is quite high.
Just two quick questions, one in the investment management, with regards to the flows in liquidity products, I mean youÃÂÃÂve seen those kind of flows pickup in the fourth quarter of last two years, is this just where you saw this quarter again a seasonal effect with regards to liquidity products?
I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
I'll now pass the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, who is also joined by our Deputy CFO, Marty Chavez.
Over his career, Mary held positions of increasing responsibility in investment banking, institutional client services and then most recently as our Chief Information Officer.
Having worked closely with him for over a decade, I have full confidence that Marty will continue that track record as our Chief Financial Officer.
Briefly on the fourth quarter; net revenues were $8.2 billion, net earnings were $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share were $5.08 and annualized return on common equity was 11.4%.
We advise on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter including Procter & Gamble, $12.5 billion merger with beauty business into Coty.
Equity underwriting net revenues up $212 million were down 7% compared to the third quarter as follow-on offerings decreased.
Debt underwriting net revenues decreased 13% to $565 million from robust issuance levels in the third quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in energies ÃÂÃÂ4.6 billion IPO to Soros $1.6 billion high yield bond offering and it seems [indiscernible] $1.2 billion IPO.
Commodities increased significantly during the quarter as higher energy prices drove better market making conditions and more client activity.
Rates were down slightly relative to the third quarter, client activity was solid driven by diverging monetary policies.
This translated into a 6% increase year-over-year excluding DVA gains from 2015 results, given the difficult market conditions in the first quarter of 2016, 6% growth particularly notable.
Equities client execution net revenues were $459 million, down significantly across both derivatives and cash products.
Commissions and fees were $736 million, up slightly relative to the third quarter as global client volumes increased modestly.
Equity security generated net revenues of $1 billion, reflecting corporate performance as well as sales and gains in public equity investments.
On a full year basis, we had $42 billion of long term net inflows primarily driven by fixed income and $52 billion of liquidity product inflows.
Compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits was down 8% for 2016 reflecting the decline in net revenues.
Fourth quarter non-competition expenses were $2.3 billion.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Hey good morning, Glenn.
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
Yeah, so one thing I really want to point out because I know this question comes up about realizing and better you ask it but everybody asked it realize versus mark.
I think when you say indirect and direct you mean direct obviously weÃÂÃÂve been relatively high tax payer and so tax rates come down.
Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
So as for technology has clients have continued to transact more electronically weÃÂÃÂve invested more heavily in those capabilities, so that we can better serve them.
So I think if you look at history, the rate levels is still pretty low even though the tenner might have moved up a 100 basis points of one point.
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
",46.58,0.6261931
goldmansachs,q1,2017,"Our Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Marty Chavez, will now review the firmÃÂÃÂs results.
Net earnings included a $475 million tax benefit related to a new accounting standard for share-based compensation.
The operating environment in the first quarter was mixed with lower activity in several institutional market making businesses offset in part by generally higher activity in investment banking.
For our investing clients, the opportunity set was negatively affected by lower volatility.
For example within FICC, D10 foreign exchange volatility approached its lowest level in two years for the dollar-euro pair.
Reduced volatility also negatively affected client activity within another macro FICC market, commodities.
For example, realized volatility for the S&P 500 reached its lowest level for first quarter in 50 years.
Not surprisingly, U.S. cash equity volumes were generally down both sequentially and year-over-year; however, other client segments were more active in this environment.
Investment banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.7 billion, 15% higher than the fourth quarter as we saw increases in both M&A and underwriting.
Debt underwriting revenues were up 13% to $636 million and benefited from strong industry-wide leveraged finance and investment grade activity.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter, down 16% sequentially as client activity was low following a relatively active fourth quarter.
Most of our businesses produced lower net revenues quarter over quarter.
Equities client execution net revenues of $552 million were up 20% compared to a weaker fourth quarter, but roughly consistent with the quarterly average for 2016.
The business operated in an environment with global equity market strength but lower volatility.
Securities services generated net revenues of $384 million, down 4% quarter over quarter.
Equities securities generated net revenues of $798 million, reflecting sales, corporate performance and gains in public equity investments.
We have consistently generated roughly $8 billion of revenues in each of the past four quarters despite a variety of different environments.
Second, operating efficiently, which means striking the right balance between addressing challenges and investing in future opportunities.
Good morning, thanks very much.
Then I personally hate this question but IÃÂÃÂm going to ask it anyway, because it doesnÃÂÃÂt make sense to me, but plenty of talk in the market about some version of Glass-Steagall or some greater separation than weÃÂÃÂve already seen with the capital requirements and the regulatory environment.
There is always things that we can do better, and itÃÂÃÂs important to note weÃÂÃÂre constantly analyzing our results with an eye towards continually improving them.
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Okay, but I mean, it does sound like youÃÂÃÂre thinking that there were some positioning issues as opposed to it just being customer flow.
IÃÂÃÂm wondering whether you see any specific events in Q2 that could actually increase volatility from your point of view.
So certainly weÃÂÃÂre all looking at the same thing as we head into the French election next week - volatility, for instance dollar-euro has picked up significantly since intra-quarter, and weÃÂÃÂd also generally see that clarity on outcome increases the probability of action.
Other than that, just IÃÂÃÂll note, which weÃÂÃÂve already discussed, thereÃÂÃÂs often a connection between reasonable levels of volatility around market trends driving risk managers to transact.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures thatÃÂÃÂs posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
IÃÂÃÂll walk you through the first quarter results, then IÃÂÃÂll turn it over to Harvey for some brief comments at the end, then obviously weÃÂÃÂll be happy to answer any questions.
Breaking down the components of investment banking in the first quarter, advisory revenues were $756 million, up 7% relative to the fourth quarter.
Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, down 7% compared to the fourth quarter.
As I mentioned, despite a benign market backdrop, low volatility across many FICC-related products constrained the opportunity set for our clients and reduced activity levels.
In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.7 billion, up 5% sequentially.
Commissions and fees were $738 million, flat with the fourth quarter as activity levels remained generally low.
Moving onto our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the first quarter.
On the Volcker Rule, we applied for and received a five-year extension for substantially all of our remaining covered funds, which totaled approximately $6 billion at the end of the quarter.
In investment management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion.
As we look forward, we remain focused on several operational objectives: first, providing world-class advice and execution services to our global clients and delivering the whole firm to them.
Also, I believe you mentioned $8 billion of annual revenues in FICC, if I heard you right.
The ratios have ticked down 20 or 30 basis points since the end of last year, depending on which ratio youÃÂÃÂre talking about, and really itÃÂÃÂs on increased credit RWAs, which is primarily driven by lending for the advanced approach, and lending and funding transactions for standardized.
It seems like maybe over the past two years, the business has been maybe on a relative basis a bit more challenged, and we can point to a lot of things in terms of the client mix, whether itÃÂÃÂs hedge funds or investment managers, theyÃÂÃÂre facing some pressures.
But just wanted to get a sense - when you guys look at the business and the mix, are you positioned where you want to be, and then when we think about that in terms of the outlook, is there more that can be done on the expense or capital base or do you think that youÃÂÃÂre still--youÃÂÃÂre looking for a positive kind of revenue backdrop with the current mix that you have?
I know thatÃÂÃÂs a lot in there, but just trying to get a sense because it seems like it wasnÃÂÃÂt just one quarter.
Yes, so I think itÃÂÃÂs important to note that weÃÂÃÂre not focusing on revenue share, and while top line revenue and revenue share are among the many factors that we look at, the focus is on serving the clients, our impact and engagement with them, and on returns, so returns, not revenues, and generating strong ROEs over the cycle.
TheyÃÂÃÂre just always really just part of the constant discipline here to look at expenses, and as you know, we have significantly changed that business over the last few years since beginning of 2012 to now headcount, compensation, benefits, risk-weighted assets, balance sheet all down.
Okay, and then maybe as a follow-up, if you can give us the--I donÃÂÃÂt think you guys gave us the fully phased in unit ratios, and I think in the last quarter, maybe a quarter before that, Harvey, you mentioned just in terms of where you think the G-SIB buffer would pan out.
I know everything is kind of potentially in flux when we look at the outlook, but just how youÃÂÃÂre thinking about that.
So IÃÂÃÂve got a couple questions this morning just on 1Q tends to be the highest quarter in FICC, and my thought is, well look, if vol is down so much right now today, as you mentioned thatÃÂÃÂs the biggest driver, do you--as vol increases, do you expect that the VAR productivity could go higher, like it had in prior periods of rising rates?
Then just lastly on the Volcker Rule, Marty, you mentioned that you asked and received the five-year extension here on the $6 billion.
You might be laughing, like whoÃÂÃÂs asking about five years out, but IÃÂÃÂll just ask the obvious question there, but then also how youÃÂÃÂre thinking about redeploying the capital that frees up as these assets roll off.
WeÃÂÃÂd note that some of our competitors had bigger financing businesses and more significant corporate footprints as a result of larger lending books, but again itÃÂÃÂs one quarter and business mix differences might reflect performance, relative performance quarter to quarter, but we believe our model has lots of leverage improving client activity.
ItÃÂÃÂs nice of you to say you donÃÂÃÂt want to give Marty a hard time for the call, but I think this is--in some respects, weÃÂÃÂve had this conversation on and off over the past four and a half years, and I think last year in the third and fourth quarter, where you might have said we outperformed, that wasnÃÂÃÂt a moment of celebration for us, and as Marty said, this isnÃÂÃÂt a moment of bigger concern for us.
Following up, though, on a component there, a couple years ago you guys had made the effort to try to grow out the corporate client base.
Okay, thanks for taking the questions.
Morning, Guy. Okay, so umpteenth question on the FICC thing, and IÃÂÃÂm just going to follow up on a comment that you made, which is we heard several times that obviously clients were less active and that has lots to do with mix, and that makes sense.
But I think I also heard you say that you didnÃÂÃÂt feel like you had navigated some of the currents as effectively as you might have, and I was wondering if you could break down between the areas that you called out as having been headwinds, which were commodities, FX and, I think to a lesser extent, credit, where in particular maybe there were issues with inventory management or positioning, as opposed to just the customer flow.
Is it fake math or good math to kind of compare that $300 million, $320 million to the $900 million of cost saves and think that the message youÃÂÃÂre sending is that maybe a third or so of that $900 million is on the comp line?
I wouldnÃÂÃÂt call out that one in particular, but we look at many things, and since we do have, as you mentioned, a strong tradition of building tools and applying those tools to deliver results for our clients, thatÃÂÃÂs something we intend to continue.
Marty, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of an update on whatÃÂÃÂs going on with the Marcus consumer lending initiative ,so maybe you can give us a sense of where originations are now and how theyÃÂÃÂre tracking relative to your firmÃÂÃÂs initial expectations of a few quarters ago.
If you want to look at the client execution line quarter on quarter, itÃÂÃÂs really about cash and derivatives performance, and then if youÃÂÃÂre looking year-on-year, itÃÂÃÂs really about derivatives.
ItÃÂÃÂs just part of the operating environment, and working with our clients, regulators, peers through the process of the rule making and the implementation is just something that weÃÂÃÂve been doing for a long time and itÃÂÃÂs just part of how the business operates.
If any additional questions arise, please donÃÂÃÂt hesitate to reach out to Dane; otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day and look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in July.
",48.37,0.86908346
goldmansachs,q2,2017,"Good morning, my name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today.
I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2017 Earnings conference call.
This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call.
We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including C.
We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including Syngenta's $43.6 billion sale to ChemChina, HPE's $13.5 billion spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences and Private Bancorp's $5 billion sale to CIBC.
During the second quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs participating in QUALCOMM's $11 billion bond offering in support of its acquisition of NXP.
Equities client execution net revenues of $687 million were up 24% compared to first quarter due to stronger results in cash products.
Commissions and fees were $764 million up 4% versus the first quarter as volumes increased modestly.
Security services generated net revenues of $441 million up 15% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally stronger client activity.
Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3% and finally we repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock for $1.5 billion in the quarter.
For the four quarters CCAR cycle for 2016, we provided shareholders with nearly $7 billion of capital through share buybacks and common stock dividends.
Good morning, Glenn.
Good morning, Michael.
Good morning, Guy. Guy Moszkowski
IÃÂÃÂm kind of sitting back trying to think how much LCR/SRL easing could potentially increase the financing available to clients and therefore kind of boost trading volumes overall market activity.
Good morning Betsy.
Good morning, Marty.
Good morning, Marty.
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2017 earnings conference call.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures thatÃÂÃÂs posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
Taking a step back to review our year-to-date results, we had firmwide net revenues of $15.9 billion, net earnings of $4.1 billion, earnings per diluted share of $9.10 and a return on common equity of 10.1%.
Another area of strength is investment management, where we posted record management and other fees and assets under supervision and investing and lending generated $1.6 billion of revenues in the quarter with net interest income within debt securities and loans reaching more than $400 million.
In addition, our clients place significant value on the firm's long-standing commitment to market making as well as our strength in derivatives.
Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses; net revenues were $3.1 billion in the second quarter down 9% compared to the first quarter.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.2 billion in the second quarter down 31% sequentially as volatility and client conviction remained low and led to weaker client activity quarter-over-quarter.
Now moving to equities, which include equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion up 13% sequentially.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.6 billion in the second quarter.
So, I definitely heard all the commentary on FICC and I think commodities is one of the things that stands out that's makes you different than the others, but maybe we could talk about the mix of clients and how much that adds to may be the differentiated performance that we're seeing meaning you see more volatility dependent right.
Obviously, that's a question on our mind as well as yours and so to step back for a moment, while there are nuances and everyone's franchise is a bit different as we all know, our franchise emphasizes providing liquidity to active asset managers.
Our business starts and ends with them and those communicating with them, coming up with new products, technologies, tools, analytics, workflows and iterating that we have on offering that is what they're looking for and that's something that we're going to continue doing and we're totally committed to it.
What I would say there Glenn is really on predicting when anything will be different than it is just looking back historically one year ago exactly at this time, I don't think any one of us would've predicted the strong client activity, market environment of the second half of 2016.
You mentioned in terms of looking at the business and maybe some of the client gaps the market share.
But I think even in '16 when we look at the global competitors, it seems like the FICC business has been a little bit more challenged.
So, I am just trying to figure out how far along to gain that process is the management team or is the FICC franchise in terms of reassessing whether it's a client, the product mix to try to diversify and broaden some of the growth opportunities?
Well it's a good question and so let's go into some other effects that may be going on here and also caveated by saying that we don't have transparency into our competitor's FICC businesses, but I'll note that historically we'd had strength in derivatives and this was a weak quarter like the first quarter for derivatives.
Also, it's likely that some of our competitors have bigger corporate footprints than we do as well as bigger financing footprints than we do and so while four of our business in FICC has been as I mentioned providing liquidity to active asset managers, it isn't a matter of just focusing on active asset managers and having a leading active manager franchise.
And then just a follow-up I guess on CCAR and just capital priorities, given the combination of some of the maybe challenges on the trading side, but then also just evaluation of the stock, is there anything changed in terms of how much you guys are focused on capital return verses reinvesting in the business, M&A activity and if there is areas I know you guys been active on the asset management side, but anything else on that front?
Sure, so looking at our FICC businesses as we discussed, year-on-year they all declined except for mortgages and sequentially they all declined and while there are nuances, the primary driver across most of the businesses and I'll get to commodities in a moment, the primary driver for the decline sequentially or year-on-year was lower client activity with all the drivers that we discussed, lower volatility, less dispersion, less opportunity set.
Commodities as a story of challenges on all fronts and there it was lower client activity and also a difficult market-making environment as you know in market-making if I could use for a moment a store analogy though is more complex than the typical store, our clients we need to have in our store that the clients are seeking and we need to have a capacity to create the products that the clients are seeking and sometimes clients are also selling us products they go into the store, which is maybe different from a typical store.
As you mentioned it was an environment of higher equity prices and low volatility and then you asked the questions why is this -- how is this different and I would note several things.
And we noticed our market share going up not just with our active manager client, but also the passive managers as for providing capital and equities client execution we observed increased demand around a variety of events.
The European elections also as we noticed last year around the Brexit referendum in addition as it relates to equities client execution we observed a normalization in the markets in Asia.
And to get to another part of your question we are observing the positive results of investing over multiple quarters in both execution and in and in capital commitment and then in addition I would note corporate activity remained healthy and is typically not correlated with the activity of the active manager clients.
And about two-thirds of them roughly our activities that the regulators could undertake that don't require legislative authorization and the report did get a bit more specific on the ratios that you mentioned are particularly SLR and there's certainly been a lot of commentary and research out of the market about what changes to the SLR might create in terms of capacity.
We don't have bar targets and bar is an output of clientÃÂÃÂs activity, client demand for capital as we discussed and as you noted it declined from $64 million to $51 million sequentially, so call it 20% and looking across the product areas, really, it's lower volatility as the main driver in currencies, there's a bit of a positional driver in addition to the ball driver.
There is a lot of reasons for that but really, we just think of it as a business that serves the clients holistically across a number of different products.
But I guess the question is then, how much do you think or are concerned about maybe structural headwinds on the demand side when you have greater transparency in the markets you have pressures on fees and flows on active managers and passives and even exchanges are trying to grab market share from OTC markets.
As for derivatives versus cash, again it wouldn't see it as one or the other why not why not both and of course we're going to continue investing in our historical strength in derivatives and stay with our clients over the long term not just in the quarters where there are extremely active.
So for a particular kind of risk, you could have futures, derivatives, cash, systematic trading strategies, ETFs, and it just goes on and on, and really as opposed to attempting to predict which product format is going to be appealing to the client, I think that would be really brittle to have a prediction and move everything in that direction and really the way we're seeing it, the way we see generally everything is preparing the firm to respond to a variety of different market states and a variety of different client needs.
So, great question Steven, IÃÂÃÂll just note that we don't really - while of course we have all kinds of analytics, we don't really break out the business in that particular way.
I think to go back to that store analogy, there is - well it would be - maybe a wonderful utopian thing to be able to operate the two and say one is client activity and one is when it navigating the markets.
As for the rest of the FICC businesses, it really was a story of lower client activity very good.
ThatÃÂÃÂs a great question, so as you noted year-to-date our volumes are strong and outperforming and of course the quarter is important and useful and standard are construct.
",44.31,0.823637
goldmansachs,q3,2017,"I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2017 Earnings conference call.
This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs.
Revenue strength in investment banking and investment management helped to offset weaker FICC performance.
As Harvey discussed at a recent conference, we had detailed plans across each of our businesses to drive stronger client relationships and shareholder value creation in the current operating environment.
As it relates specifically to this quarterÃÂÃÂs performance, revenues increased 6% sequentially and 2% year-over-year.
Investment banking produced third quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 4% compared to the second quarter including strong results in advisory.
Debt underwriting revenues of $674 million included strong acquisition finance activity.
Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked 1st in worldwide common-stock offerings, and also had a leading position in leveraged finance.
Despite the increase, third quarter results still represented a bottom decile performance.
Equities client execution net revenues of $584 million were down 15% compared to the second quarter.
Security services generated net revenues of $403 million, down 9% sequentially, reflecting typical second quarter seasonality.
As mentioned earlier, compensation and benefits expense for the year to date which include salary, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 40%.
As you probably know, Dane will become the firmÃÂÃÂs new Global Head of Human Capital Management in January.
How much do you think of that balance sheet is relationship lending versus straight investment versus more of an asset management like revenue?
So, just -- not to harp, but I wanted to stand a little bit on BetsyÃÂÃÂs question about expected loss through the cycle because one of the push backs that I had when I spoken to investors about your growth opportunities is that the implied margins on the loan asset balances donÃÂÃÂt seem to many people like they really incorporate sort of full through the cycle loss potential.
And thereÃÂÃÂs also a connection to our bar number which declined a bit, $4 million sequentially and the drivers in the bar number going down were all continuing to decline across products but also reduced commodity positions.
And since I was the guy who gave you such a hard time about the buyback disclosure last quarter, I should certainly thank you for doing it now.
I was hoping you can just shed some light on what drove the decline in management fees linked quarter, just given the strong equity markets that we saw and the pretty health -- continued healthy increasing AUM.
And then, just thinking longer term in relation to the $1 billion revenue target to business investment management where weÃÂÃÂve seen pretty substantial secular headwinds and fee pressures, and IÃÂÃÂve got a lot of questions from clients as to whatÃÂÃÂs giving you guys the confidence that you can hit that $1 billion incremental revenue target.
With the federal reserve moving into a full unwind next year, have you guys mapped out what the volatility could do because of this changing position by the federal reserve and what it might do for the revenues for your FICC business?
ThereÃÂÃÂs about a $1.3 billion decline in fixed income so you kind of have offsetting effect with those two things, which is letting your overall revenue still grow this year.
Do you know the capital dollar amounts were only up less than $2 billion year-on-year starting points or really increased by more than that, is it just the ratios are higher simply?
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures thatÃÂÃÂs posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
IÃÂÃÂll walk you through the third quarter and the year-to-date results; then, IÃÂÃÂll be happy to answer any questions.
Year-to-date, our firm-wide revenues are up 8% or $1.8 billion versus the same period last year, reflecting a broad contribution across most of our businesses.
As a result of revenue growth and expense discipline, our pre-tax earnings are up 16% to $8 billion and our ROE is 160 basis points higher at 10.3% for the first nine months of the year.
Breaking down the components of investment banking in the third quarter, advisory revenues were $911 million, up 22% compared to the second quarter as deal closings accelerated.
Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.1 billion in the third quarter, up 2% compared to the second quarter, reflecting a recovery in FICC performance.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the third quarter, up 25% sequentially.
Now moving to equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.7 billion, down 12% sequentially.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.9 billion in the third quarter.
Given our continued efforts to expand our lending footprint, loans receivable were the biggest growth driver, up $8 billion quarter-over-quarter to $61 billion.
In investment management, we reported third quarter net revenue of $1.5 billion, flat with the second quarter.
When we think about the net interest income and are investing in lending line; that has grown significantly over time, and we see it as a stable and growing revenue source.
Maybe first question, just on investment banking, the results came in strong, you mentioned on the M&A side some deals closing and then, you also just mentioned the pipeline down, just any context around that?
So, as I mentioned, Mike, the backlog is down sequentially and down year-to-date, and thatÃÂÃÂs just natural side effect of the strong closings that we had in the third quarter; some of those deals had actually been in the backlog for a couple of quarters.
I know, thereÃÂÃÂs still a lot of shifting strategies in the industry, in conversations, but any kind of indication on how you think that impacts on the industry and you guys, either from a research standpoint, trading standpoint or market share?
You mentioned a little bit of detail within the loan growth this quarter on an earlier question.
So, on the $5 billion of revenue targets, itÃÂÃÂs important to emphasize again that they donÃÂÃÂt depend on any improvement in the underlying market conditions or any change in regulation.
And we called out in our discussions in September the various parts of that market, which weÃÂÃÂve talked about are private wealth management business, GS Select, institutional lending of various kinds.
And internally, as you would expect, weÃÂÃÂve had growth initiatives since forever, and youÃÂÃÂve seen some of the results of those, whether itÃÂÃÂs in asset management or in our debt underwriting business or growing our asset management business.
Well, we definitely are taking that on and going back to what we described in September, there is a breakdown, various aspects of the revenue opportunity as well as balance sheet and capital against it.
So for instance being able to do these simulations of our balance sheet and income statement and cash flows several months, 18 months into the future is an important part of how we make decisions and not really seeing it is something that we break out, specifically as a cost and as a cost that would be reduced but certainly IÃÂÃÂm happy to say that our focus as just did beyond the implementing of the regulations, which is something we will always do as they arise to growth.
I know, weÃÂÃÂve got -- I think you laid out $28 billion of loan balances.
And again, as with all aspects of what we set out for you and for the market, itÃÂÃÂs really -- it bottoms up looking at the activities where the businesses, where these activities are going to occur.
But, as I said at the outset, I think if we step back and look at the first nine months of this year in FICC and compare it to the first nine months of last year, you see something different that you couldnÃÂÃÂt otherwise piece together, which is, if you look at the delta in FICC, half of that decline -- and so itÃÂÃÂs 23% decline, nine months on nine months, half of it is attributable to commodities inventory; and of that amount, half of that occurred in the second quarter.
How do you -- how do we kind of I guess try to arms around, do you have a thought on if the SLRs changed, would the tier 1 leverage also change, therefore freeing up some capital or balance sheet, or do you think that remains?
And as you know, we and many others welcome the initiatives and the detail of the first and second treasury reports that there -- the potential tailwinds, they are not baked into our $5 billion annual revenue plan.
Going to the second part of your question on the investment management opportunities that we outlined, which was as we said a $1 billion annual revenue opportunity.
IÃÂÃÂm just wondering, if you can give us some insight in how youÃÂÃÂre thinking about the need to focus more on some of the growth opportunities which maybe you had, not emphasized as much given your continued strong capital discipline.
So, also in the third quarter, as the GSIB buffer, weÃÂÃÂre again in that 3% range and itÃÂÃÂs something that we look at every day and work with divisional leaders as we see opportunities to have a strong balance sheet and capital and deploy it and invest in our business and long-term growth.
So, we highlighted for you in the growth initiatives on annual revenue opportunity of $500 million related to PWM and GS Select together.
ItÃÂÃÂs too early to give you progress but it is a part of the initiatives that we outlined, which right now we are aggregating under PWM -- PWM and GS Select together, $500 million revenue opportunity, $11 billion of balance sheet over three years and the implied the yield is evident from that.
So, we do create lotÃÂÃÂs and lotÃÂÃÂs of contingency plans and so looking at what the Fed has said, as you know theyÃÂÃÂve been very specific, theyÃÂÃÂve given us $10 billion a month and then thatÃÂÃÂs going to increase every three months by $10 billion, and so it gets to $50 billion and letting assets roll off that redemption from their balance sheet and theyÃÂÃÂve given us the mix between treasuries and agencies.
Then my second question is, if you look at the seasonal progression of that comp ratio, given that you do have this investment lending gains your revenues are still kind of at the same level you had last year.
As for the comp ratio, of course we -- itÃÂÃÂs an important part of our business and we put a lot of time and energy into considering it and setting it appropriately.

goldmansachs,q4,2017,"I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures thatÃÂÃÂs posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
Potential benefits could take many forms including heightened M&A activity, increased financing volumes, or the most important indirect benefit to our business, economic growth.
Despite the fourth quarter charge, the direct benefits from forward EPS and ROE accretion, coupled with the potential for several indirect tailwinds are material, long-term positive for shareholders.
We were able to post these strong results despite the industry-wide headwinds, facing one of our businesses, FICC, and despite continued investments in future revenue opportunities that has not yet contributed meaningfully to earnings.
Continued strength in global equity and credit markets coincided with lower levels of market volatility and client trading activity.
Three of our four business segments including Investment Banking, Investment Management, and Investing & Lending produced solid net revenue growth and led to an overall increase in the firmÃÂÃÂs revenues.
Equity underwriting net revenues of $460 million more than doubled compared to the third quarter, driven by an increase in follow-on offerings including our role as sole arranger into ToshibaÃÂÃÂs ÃÂÃÂ¥600 billion private placement.
Debt underwriting net revenues increased 35% to $909 million and included significant contributions from leveraged finance activity.
This growth happened despite our smaller lending footprint because we identified it as a strategic priority where we saw an opportunity to grow share, invested continuously over a number of years and executed relentlessly for the benefit of our clients and shareholders.
This strong performance reflects our continued focus on building long-term client relationships and our ongoing investment in talent and capabilities.
Looking forward, our Investment Banking backlog increased versus the third quarter, driven by announced M&A volumes.
Most of our businesses were impacted by low volatility across global markets, which affected client activity.
A variety of factors including reduced volatility and lower client activity which particularly affected G10 currencies contributed to the decline.
Mortgages, although a smaller business, increased significantly versus last year, reflecting improved performance in commercial and residential mortgages.
And we believe as we continue to improve our connectivity with clients, we can drive meaningfully better performance going forward.
Lastly, securities services generated relatively stable net revenues of $1.6 billion as higher client balances were offset by a mix shift in short covering to more liquid securities.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.2 billion, reflecting corporate performance as well as sales and gains in public equity investments.
Our Investing & Lending balance sheet ended the quarter at $120 billion, up 4% or $4 billion versus last quarter, driven by continued growth and real estate, private wealth and consumer loans.
Our net interest income within debt securities was approximately $1.8 billion for the year.
With respect to debt I&L, the recent expansion of our lending activities positions the firm with $2 billion of run rate net interest income as we start 2018.
Compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior equity awards and other items such benefits was up 2% for 2017, which was 300 basis points lower than the increase in net revenues.
The increase versus the third quarter was driven primarily by a $127 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable fund, higher expenses related to consolidated investments and higher consulting fees.
The first driver relates to our investment in Marcus; second, were expenses associated with investments that need to be consolidated in our balance sheet for accounting purposes; and third, were higher technology and consulting costs to support both regulatory implementation efforts and our ongoing focus on improving efficiency and scale throughout our businesses.
Our reported effective tax rate for the year was 61.5% including the $4.4 billion tax charge, which was partially offset by a $719 million benefit related to employee equity compensation.
Our fourth quarter tax rate reflected $223 million of this benefit, primarily from the delivery of certain prior year equity awards in December.
For the first quarter of 2018, assuming current stock price levels, we estimate the equity compensation related accounting benefit will be approximately $175 million.
Just how are you guys thinking about your lower tax rate in terms of either reinvesting in the business, so basically like the expense outlook, as you look into 2018 or 2019 or how much will it drop to the bottom-line?
Your next question is from the line of Matt OÃÂÃÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
And I think IÃÂÃÂve heard you say that youÃÂÃÂd like to do more trading with corporate clients where youÃÂÃÂre -- itÃÂÃÂs kind of a mix issue when it comes to the trading results, Goldman versus peers.
I have just a slightly different way of asking that question, but on your outlook where you gave your three-year forward revenue potential growth initiatives.
Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
Yes. We generally notice that at low levels, for instance of interest rates, but also at low level of volatility, itÃÂÃÂs -- weÃÂÃÂll see this effect, bid offer compression.
Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Excluding the one-time tax charge, fourth quarter net earnings were $2.5 billion and EPS was $5.68.
And with these headwinds, we concentrated on serving our clients, rolling out our growth initiatives, and investing to drive our business forward.
Conversely, in Institutional Client Services and FICC in particular, revenues declined as the business continued to operate in a low volatility, low activity environment.
And as I will talk about later, we are making significant engineering investments to further expand our client franchise, grow revenues, and transform the long-term earnings profile of the firm.
In the fourth quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2.1 billion, 19% higher than the third quarter, as a significant pickup in underwriting more than offset a decline in M&A.
Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 55% sequentially as equity issuance improved and we participated in numerous large transactions around the world.
For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7.4 billion, up 18% from 2016 on increases in both financial advisory and underwriting.
Net revenues were $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, down 24% compared to the third quarter amid lower volumes in a variety of markets and continued low volatility.
For the full year, ICS generated $11.9 billion of net revenues, down 18% compared to 2016, also driven by lower volatility in client activity and a particularly challenging backdrop for our commodities franchise.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1 billion in the fourth quarter, down significantly versus the third quarter, reflecting a continued challenging operating environment.
For the full year, FICC client execution net revenues were $5.3 billion, translating into a 30% year-over-year decline.
In equities, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion, down 18% sequentially.
Relative to the third quarter, equities client execution net revenues were down significantly on lower results in both cash and derivatives.
For the year, equities client execution net revenues were $2 billion, down 7%, driven by lower derivatives performance.
Collectively, these activities produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter.
In Investment Management, we produced fourth quarter net revenues of $1.7 billion, our second best quarterly performance.
For 2017, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year, largely driven by growth in management and other fees on higher assets.
These investments will allow us to leverage our intellectual capital in more impactful ways, to evolve and be a disruptor in new and existing markets and will affect all of our businesses.
As we look forward to 2018, given the positive backdrop for investing further in our franchise and the impact of tax legislation on our capital ratios, we do not expect to use all of our 2017 CCAR cycle authorization.
But to talk a bit more about our debt underwriting business, as we said, record in many ways, not only league tables, also revenues full year on the quarter.
I love dashboards and those are going be metrics of all kinds, including the capital because of course weÃÂÃÂre changing from a -- where weÃÂÃÂve been in the past few years.
Now, we see these opportunities for growth, high marginal ROEs and of course we prefer all day to invest in these opportunities that are in our business compared to buying back our stock above book value.
But, I guess, I am trying to get a feel for kind of the frequency of tough years historically versus other FICC businesses.
And as you know, in our growth plans that weÃÂÃÂve been talking about, there is a component of the $5 billion annual revenue opportunity developing over the next three years, a $250 million component, which is expanding our corporate franchise in both foreign exchange and commodities.
Well, to step back, weÃÂÃÂre making progress on all of the growth initiatives that we outlined, deploying balance sheet, growing deposits, AUS, hiring employees into FICC, improving market share in FICC and equities, and specifically increasing the mandates from this joint venture between investment banking and trading.
And also, one thing that we know from having seen the cycles many times is that when we start making this progress in market share, it actually needs a better activity environment for the penetration to flow through to revenues.
And also, given the one-time effect of tax legislation that we just went through our financials in the fourth quarter, thought the actual payments happen over eight years, we are going to be focused on having those capital ratios be robust in the next few quarters.
But rather than look at third quarter or fourth quarter, much more relevant for your analysis and for the way weÃÂÃÂre thinking about the business to look at full year.
And so, full year, itÃÂÃÂs up 5%, in line with the revenue growth and that was all deliberate.
And itÃÂÃÂs something that we expect and embrace and weÃÂÃÂre investing for growth and pivoting to executing on the growth plan and delivering earnings growth that non-comp growth proceeds revenue generation.
And I was just wondering should we expect that that could keep going in say a 5% revenue growth environment like what you had last year, should we expect that the comp ratio would come down again meaningfully or with the acceleration of some of the investments in the initiatives that youÃÂÃÂve laid out.
So, one of the many things weÃÂÃÂre doing on this front and itÃÂÃÂs one of the topics that I mentioned when I talked about how our various engineering activities are transforming all of the businesses of the firm not confined to any one business.
If you compare full year 2017 to full year 2016, one-third of the decline in FICC revenues is attributable to our commodities business.

goldmansachs,q1,2018,"Better growth prospects are supporting central bank efforts to reduce stimulus which has been a primary factor driving the below average market volatility seen in recent years.
Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.8 billion, 16% lower than a very robust fourth quarter, which was our strongest in over ten years.
Equity underwriting net revenues of $410 million declined 11% driven by lower industry volumes.
Debt underwriting net revenues were $797 million, the second best quarter ever following last quarterÃÂÃÂs record.
Growing debt underwriting has been a long-term priority for the firm and we expect our strong M&A franchise will continue to support robust contribution from acquisition-related financings.
Performance was supported by better prospects for global growth and higher market volatility.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2.1 billion in the first quarter, more than doubling fourth quarter levels reflecting a better operating environment and our efforts to strengthen client relationships.
We saw higher sequential performance across all five of our global fixed income businesses as higher client activity drove a broader opportunity set despite a continued competitive environment with relatively tight bid ask spreads.
We also saw increased activity in areas where we have historical strength including higher activity in derivatives and structured transactions as clients sought to access emerging trends or hedge risks.
Equities Client Execution net revenues of $1.1 billion rose significantly, driving our highest quarterly performance in three years on stronger results in both cash and derivatives.
Security Services net revenues of $432 million rose 6% on higher client balances.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.1 billion, reflecting net gains from private equities driven by company-specific events and corporate performance.
Our global equity portfolio was $23 billion at quarter end and remains well diversified with over 900 different investments.
Net revenues from debt securities and loans were robust $1 billion.
Results included over $550 million of net interest income, which continues to grow as we seek to increase more recurring revenue streams.
Our long-term vision for markets is to create the leading platform for millions of consumers to take control of their financial lives offering personalized products to save and borrow better simple, transparence and provide value to customers.
We produced record revenues in the first quarter driven by our diversified global asset management business and differentiated private wealth management franchise.
Net revenues were $1.8 billion including relatively stable management and other fees.
Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.5 trillion, up $4 billion versus the fourth quarter driven by $13 billion of long-term net inflows across fixed income and equity partially offset by $5 billion of liquidity product outflows and $4 billion of market depreciation.
Regarding our $5 billion in growth initiatives, we track our progress in a detailed and comprehensive way mapping not just the specific revenues generated from each initiative, but many key performance indicators that will provide insight into our progress.
We also continue to emphasize producing higher revenues from more recurring sources such as Investment Management, and Lending generating significant operating leverage and diversifying the long-term earnings profile of the firm.
ItÃÂÃÂs ÃÂÃÂ you also referenced Bloomberg Trade Book which brought on 1300 new clients and thatÃÂÃÂs got some revenue runrate associated with it and weÃÂÃÂve been onboarding low touch and quant clients in connection with the new product services and platforms weÃÂÃÂve been developing.

Hey, good morning, Marty.
Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
So the $50 million this quarter relate to the revenue recognition accounting change, should think thatÃÂÃÂs maybe a low number moving forward, just assuming revenues in areas like M&A advisory, move higher?
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures thatÃÂÃÂs posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website www.gs.com.
During the first quarter, the positive outlook for global growth translated into improved corporate and investor confidence and subsequently solid activity across the firm, particularly in our Investment Banking and Market Making businesses.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, Investment Banking, FICC, Equities, Investing & Lending and Investment Management, each produced net revenue growth with four of the five increasing 18% or more.
While itÃÂÃÂs impossible to predict the future, we remain cautiously optimistic that many of the broader drivers underpinning the solid start to the year, healthy economic growth, relatively positive investor sentiment and the emergence of new market trends can remain in place.
We are pleased with our improved performance in the quarter as it demonstrates the earnings power of our diversified franchise and shows what is possible with modest improvements in the environment and client activity and we believe there is room for additional revenue and earnings growth as we further diversify our global franchise across a broader client base with an expanded suite of products and services.
The improvement in FICC was also evident on a year-over-year basis with a significant increase in currencies reflecting strong performance in emerging markets, as well as significantly better results in commodities and credit.
We are pleased to see our FICC business improve versus a difficult 2017, which we believe in part represents our continued efforts to expand and diversify our global client franchise.
Turning to Equities, net revenues for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, up 69% sequentially as equity market volatility rebounded globally from record lows driving higher client activity, and the broader opportunity set.
Higher non-compensation expenses versus the first quarter of last year reflects both higher client activity and our investments in future growth.
Our balance sheet was $974 billion, up 6% versus last quarter driven by increased client activity and demand for our balance sheet.
Given current capital levels and the opportunities we see to support our client franchise, we do not expect to execute share repurchases in the second quarter and will use earnings to support future investments.
We have been transparent our growth plans and there is a clear demand from clients for our balance sheet, which provides an opportunity to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders.
Looking forward, we continue to make significant investments in our future to deepen and expand our client franchise and drive growth in each of our businesses.
The vol spike, particularly at the beginning of February was a positive contributor to the EquitiesÃÂÃÂ P&L, but again client activity was the major driver and it would have been a strong quarter without the long volatility benefits.
The performance was strong across flow and structured products, across cash and derivatives, across geographies, and all the business lines when delta derivatives and prime there was really broad based improvement where the volatility created a robust market-making backdrop and the clients were active and we executed well.
Of course, we will see how itÃÂÃÂs going to evolve and all of this has to ÃÂÃÂ how the businesses evolve and responses that we make in demand from the clients is a dynamic process.
Based on the proposal, we would expect stress capital buffer to be the binding constraint and we will continue what weÃÂÃÂve been doing for a long time now which is dynamically allocating our scarce resources, optimizing under all of these constraints as they evolve with the goal always of growing the franchise driving returns.
For instance, sales in the private portfolio, but really the key to it is that we have [attractive] [ph] sourcing mechanism and itÃÂÃÂs finding great businesses and working with them to operate them and make them better and of course, thatÃÂÃÂs been driving not only the results you seen in this quarter and prior quarters, the long-term book value for us.
I called out the inflows in our Investment Management business and also to say a little bit on Marcus, the funded loan balance is about $2.4 billion, originations through the end of the first quarter life-to-date approximately $3 billion and you also know of the announcement of Clarity MoneyÃÂÃÂs ÃÂÃÂ after the acquisition of Clarity Money, which closed on Friday and there Clarity Money is a digital app that aligns with what weÃÂÃÂve been doing already in Marcus.
Marty, just, I guess, a question on client content and activity levels both in banking and trading, like the industry, we always have kind of a seasonal lift in the first quarter.
WeÃÂÃÂve gotten the tax reform and rising rates and on the flip side, weÃÂÃÂve got some trade work and churns, flatter yield curves, so where do you see if there is things that you can point to in the business metrics, client balances activity?
Whether itÃÂÃÂs in banking or trading that makes you think that the ÃÂÃÂ beyond potential that you are better this year over the next couple of years, thatÃÂÃÂs different versus the past year is where weÃÂÃÂve seen kind of the 1Q bounce and then back to kind of muted activity levels?
Michael, one way to think about it is to compare this quarter to the last time we had results in both FICC and Equities at these levels.
Just wanted to get a sense when you look at kind of the demand for the balance sheet and the opportunities for growth, whether itÃÂÃÂs on the institutional ÃÂÃÂ the trading side or what you are dealing like the lending side.
And of course there is uncertainties and itÃÂÃÂs evolving and dynamic and there is going to be a lot of discussion next ÃÂÃÂ on those sixty days that the Fed has invited with the industry on stressed capital buffer and so there will likely be some evolution there as the rule makes its way into the final state.
And so, all of these things are moving and when we gave the growth plan, and the $5 billion to $6 billion expectation of share repurchases per CCAR cycle, we very much had what we thought possible for the stress capital buffer proposal in our minds when we proposed and adopted our internal capital management planning, which ensures that we are dynamically managing capital moving it around on behalf of the clients to where the highest return opportunities are for our shareholders.
I want to follow-up on the Investment Banking piece, stronger than what we are seeing at peers and especially in the DCM, debt capital markets area, you alluded to the share gains there apart from some of the build out in recent years.
And you are seeing the results of that and the consistent execution across weeks, months, quarters, years in building that business and there in that business, you saw in this quarter what is the key driver and the differentiator of the business compared to the debt underwriting businesses in the peer group, which is that we identified our core strengths which we all know in M&A and we built the debt underwriting business around that core strength.
The strategy over this period and continuing to now has remained stable which is giving advice, giving our clients access to capital markets and then applying everything we know and do about risk management to this business and doing it all in the context of strong franchise.
But what I will say in this early quarter, the second quarter after we laid out the growth plan, itÃÂÃÂs the revenue is tracking according to the internal goals that we set for ourselves.
Whether itÃÂÃÂs Investment Management components of the $1billion growth initiatives in Investment Management, about a third of it is in our Ayco Executive Counseling business, the digital platforms there in markets there.
IÃÂÃÂd expect that we are highly likely to continue with bolt-on acquisitions weÃÂÃÂve found in our Marcus business, but in many other places, thatÃÂÃÂs building it on our own allows us to deliver best-in-class experiences.
ItÃÂÃÂs a high-class problem to have, this taking capital allocation and while itÃÂÃÂs important to have the excess capacity and thatÃÂÃÂs why we highlighted that $5 billion to $6 billion expectation, if the demand from the clients continues to be strong, that is really the principal driver and when we see that demand and the opportunity to deploy capital with high ROEs thatÃÂÃÂs what we are going to do.
And we broke out some of the drivers in the year-on-year increase and outlined $100 million of that year-on-year increase is related not only to building out the Marcus platform, the market development of it, but also relating to investing in our investment entities that are consolidated on the balance sheet and therefore their expenses will also show up in non-comps.
ItÃÂÃÂs the year-on-year driver in global credit was increased client activity.
But really itÃÂÃÂs improved client activity and also I would call out within that in structure trading, particularly notable contributor to the year-on-year increase.
In rates, if we look at the sequential change in the rates business, itÃÂÃÂs definitely up sequentially as you know and there it was really client activity-driven and clients responding to Central Bank activity.
As for our ability to serve our clients make markets for them have the right amount of inventory on the balance sheet and manage all of those risks, itÃÂÃÂs dynamic.
But when we think about the $1 billion of ÃÂÃÂ it sounds like loan growth within Marcus alone this quarter.
I think it could $1 billion loan growth in Marcus have actually in the quarter, itÃÂÃÂs $0.5 billion.
And then, second, when you guys talked about your Equities trading business, Equities Client Execution was quite strong as you've indicated and I think you highlighted that the cash and derivatives area was particularly good.

During second quarter, we saw solid client engagement across our businesses with positive macro trends supporting corporate and investor activity, with the backdrop of rising U.S. rates and better visibility on QE in Europe, trends emerged across a variety of markets and asset classes.
Financial advisory revenues were $804 million, up 37% relative to the first quarter reflecting higher completed M&A volumes.
Results were our third highest on record and up 3% versus the first quarter as strength in equity offerings offset lower debt underwriting.
Debt underwriting net revenues were robust $752 million, down 6% from last quarter.
Debt underwriting performance this quarter included significant contributions from acquisition-related activity.
Our Investment Banking backlog increased significantly versus the first quarter to reach a record level driven by M&A and underwriting.
While performance declined from a solid first quarter, client engagement remained healthy and the overall backdrop remained constructive for our market-making franchises.
Rates was modestly lower sequentially as lower revenues in Europe were partially offset by solid performance in the U.S. as clients responded to central bank activity.
Commissions and fees net revenues of $763 million declined 7% on modestly lower market volumes across regions.

Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2 billion, 14% higher than the first quarter driven by robust growth in advisory and continued strong and stable performance in underwriting.
Equity underwriting net revenues of $489 million increased 19% to the highest level in 3 years as our volume growth outpaced the industry.
Turning to Equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion, down 18% versus the strong first quarter as equity market volumes and volatility declined.
Equities Client Execution net revenues of $691 million declined from the first quarter, which was our highest quarterly performance in 3 years.
Over the past 3 years, we have had a balanced franchise with derivatives and cash each contributing roughly half of Equities Client Execution revenues.
Moving to Investing & Lending, collectively, these activities produced net revenues of $1.9 billion in the second quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, our equities I&L businesses generated $2.4 billion of net revenues, roughly 65% from corporate investments and 35% from real estate.
Moving to Investment Management, we produced record net revenues in the second quarter driven by strong incentive fee realizations and solid contributions from both our asset management and PWM businesses.
Now let me turn to expenses, we continued to monitor and manage our overall expense base with an emphasis on paying for performance to attract and retain the best talent and spending to support our clients while investing in technology and infrastructure to grow the firm for the future.
The level of our share repurchase plan reflects our capital position post-tax reform and our desire to invest in the growth of our client franchise.
Before taking questions a few closing thoughts, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2018, including our execution on our $5 billion revenue growth initiatives.
And finally, we are making solid progress across a variety of lending initiatives, including expanding our customer base of Marcus borrowers and depositors, growing our lending to PWM clients, and continuing to prudently deploy capital to our institutional lending and financing business.
In conclusion, when we think about our ability to drive value, we are encouraged by roughly 15% returns year-to-date and to further benefit from our growth plans giving us increased confidence in our ability to deliver attractive long-term returns for shareholders.
Question on the I&L front I know it was a great private equity quarter, but a lot of growth is still being fueled on the I&L side, you pointed out the, call it, $2.5 billion of run-rate NII.
To add on to that question is just I think you have been there for a long time and you are increasing efforts, but it feels early days in the growth of private credit in general and does it feel like the opportunities are accelerating there and are you constrained at all by your structure meaning in the old days you might raise a big fund like some of the old [indiscernible] but Volcker limits your participation like you just put on balance sheet is the same capital treatment, I am just curious if you could talk towards that?
Maybe first question, just on the backdrop you mentioned pipeline at an all time high and you have got the tax reform, but then you get the trade stuff and so I just wanted to get some color on what you are seeing from clients both on the banking and the training front?
And then just as a follow-up, just want to get your perspective, like this is the second quarter where revenue growth has been strong, you guys produced operating leverage, ROE is year-to-date 14, TE is 15%, but valuation, it doesnÃÂÃÂt seem like you get much credit, is there ÃÂÃÂ is it more just consistency over time, do you think they will follow through and the growth in book value will eventually deliver or from a disclosure standpoint and maybe some of the newer businesses whether itÃÂÃÂs on the lending side, is there more that maybe could be down or that you guys are looking into to maybe improve disclosure and transparency?
Well, certainly Michael, we are leading in running the business for the long-term and we know that that the importance obviously of delivering revenue and earnings growth, hence the growth strategy that we outlined for the market is driving more recurring fee based revenue banding products and services and broadening the client base and thatÃÂÃÂs something that you can see in our results and itÃÂÃÂs something that we are going to continue to work on.
So just to have follow-up on operating leverage, it was pretty impressive in the first half as you said revenue growth of 22% in pre-tax even high at 33%, while all investing for growth, question is how should we think about operating leverage for the full year, I guess the comp ratio was down 200 bps for the quarter, is that a good way to think about the full year or should we be thinking about more in efficiency ratio, just we would like to get more color from you?
The comp to net revenue ratio, and as you know, Christian, is 39% is our best estimate at this point for the full year.
So, I am not going to breakout the percentage change other than to say that it was strong growth on the quarter with significance on the quarter and not only as I mentioned was it a record for the overall banking segment in backlog, itÃÂÃÂs a record M&A or financial advisory backlog and underwriting is at the second highest level ever.
Well, we are certainly seeing all kinds of trends at play and you mentioned some of them, we have seen resilient growth across many economies, rising U.S. rates, do the unwinds, tax reform behind us and therefore a lot more clarity on its stronger U.S. labor market, CEO confidence, GDP growth, all of those things are part of the macro backdrop and the momentum feels good.
I have one follow-up question and then one other question, on the follow-up I know we talked already about the comp ratio and I know in your commentary you indicated, look thatÃÂÃÂs going to be a function of revenues, but also profitability, so my question is around profitability, are you kind of suggesting to us in that commentary that you really donÃÂÃÂt want to go below 12% ROE, because we kept the 41, it would have been below that?
Quick one on Marcus, thanks for the increased disclosure especially on the refreshed FICO, thatÃÂÃÂs helpful, I know itÃÂÃÂs a new business for you guys, but I definitely appreciate the attempts to improve and enhance the disclosures there.
Good morning, Guy. Before I ask a question, I just ÃÂÃÂ I know he is not on the call, but I just thought in case he listens to it later or something, I think really we all owe a hat tip to Lloyd for his leadership over these 12 years through good times and bad.
Equities, similarly I mentioned 100 basis point expansion in wallet share since 2016, up 140, to be a little bit more precise and thatÃÂÃÂs with those systematic in quant clients and half of that progress has happened this year to give you a flavor of some of the KPIs, but we know that the market is looking for the mark-to-market.
Just on something that is related, but is going to be maybe a little nitpicky given that itÃÂÃÂs a quarter, but I am just curious in the equities business, which you pointed to, the fact is you were flat year-over-year in the second quarter at a time when your peer group that has reported so far were up on average I think so far about 20% year-over-year, granted there is 10 point sensitivity to these types of analyses, but I am just wondering were there any particular things that might have held you back in the equities business this quarter as we try to think about how we kind of annualize and go forward?
We have a leading prime platform and that business also had as you know in the second quarter of last year strong performance, solid performance and so the comp was tough.
I mentioned one of those in specific, but I am happy to go into any of them if you would like, but letÃÂÃÂs say starting with commissions and fees, I will note that those revenues were stable and again it is just one quarter versus the second quarter with commission rates going down.
Good morning, Jim. First, maybe just on follow-up on Marcus, I thought it was interesting that you are looking to expand in the UK, just what kind of drove that decision and could we see follow-through with perhaps a lending product in the UK or do we see other markets, do you enter other markets, how do we think about where thatÃÂÃÂs heading?
And maybe just a question on the SCB impact, obviously itÃÂÃÂs as you pointed out year-to-year itÃÂÃÂs going to be very different, is there other way if it stays as the economy continues to get better and the test seems to get tougher and tougher, is there a way to reduce stressed volatility in your view or do you think there might be changes to the test, so that is still a pretty big step up to the SCB from the prior buffer, I am just trying to think through that your model and some of the pure play investment banks tend to get ÃÂÃÂ seem to get harder, letÃÂÃÂs say harder in the stress test, is there anything you see thatÃÂÃÂs sort of easy to do that could help alleviate some of that or is it just sort of you got up that year-to-year?
Good morning Marty, I guess question here on Clarity Money and just what you guys have done since the acquisition, the strategy to drive more customers into the app and then just how we should think about that in terms of kind of broader consumer finance wealth management growth especially as you had more products of the offering?

goldmansachs,q3,2018,"I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.
A 25-year veteran at Goldman Sachs, Stephen has held numerous leadership positions, beginning his career in Investment Banking and then on to Fixed Income, next heading our Financing Group in Investment Banking and later serving as our head of firm-wide strategy.
Adding MartyÃÂÃÂs deep understanding of technology and the firmÃÂÃÂs balance sheet to AshokÃÂÃÂs market expertise and JimÃÂÃÂs thorough knowledge of our client needs gives us the right mix of talent to lead the Securities Division.
During the third quarter, while we saw quieter levels of client activity in certain businesses, several positive macro trends continued, including healthy global economic growth, particularly in the U.S.; strong CEO confidence; open financing markets; rising equity market valuations; and stable credit spreads.
Equity underwriting net revenues of $432 million decreased 12% sequentially amid lower follow-on volumes but more than doubled versus a year ago as IPO activity accelerated, supported by strong activity in Asia.
We also ranked number one in global IPOs. Debt underwriting net revenues were $632 million, down 16% from last quarter amid lower industry volumes.
Clarity from U.S. tax reform, a supportive economic backdrop, solid equity market valuations, significant private sponsor interest as well as corporateÃÂÃÂs desire for strategic M&A across sectors are all supporting healthy activity.
Moving to Institutional Client Services; third quarter net revenues were $3.1 billion, down 13% sequentially but roughly flat versus last year.
Currencies increased versus a year ago in both G10 and emerging markets, driven by higher activity and better performance.
Equities client execution net revenues of $681 million were roughly flat sequentially and up 17% versus a year ago.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.1 billion, reflecting net gains from private investments, primarily driven by improved corporate performance.
Our net interest income continues to grow as we increase more recurring revenue streams and lend more to our broad client base.
Net revenues were down 8% sequentially, driven by significantly lower incentive fees but up 12% versus a year ago on higher management and other fees and incentive fees.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
IÃÂÃÂm wondering if thatÃÂÃÂs the right math and if you can talk us through how you think about reserving for Marcus.
Let me also come back to the question you asked around FICO scores.
And then looking over the next couple of years, it feels like expectations are flat and assumption around continued revenue growth somewhere in the mid-single-digit range, but really no operating leverage improvement.
Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, expenses, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, supplementary leverage ratio and stress capital buffer.
This is why David, John and I, along with the rest of the leadership team, will look for new ways to grow our businesses while improving our operating efficiency for the long term.
IÃÂÃÂll now walk you through our third quarter and year-to-date results, then cover each of our businesses.
We grew year-to-date revenues by 16% or $3.8 billion, and we delivered positive operating leverage, growing pre-tax earnings by 22%.
Our year-to-date revenue growth demonstrates solid progress across the firm as all four of our business segments grew at a double-digit pace.
That reflects an 18% rebound in FICC and a 15% increase in Equities where we continue to work to deepen our existing relationships and expand our client franchise.
Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2 billion, down 3% versus the second quarter, but up 10% versus a year ago, driven by a rebound in equity underwriting.
However, our year-to-date performance was a record, reflecting strong client engagement and our multiyear investment in our acquisition finance business.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.3 billion, down 22% sequentially and 10% lower than a year ago, driven primarily by low levels of volatility and client activity.
Turning to Equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, down 5% sequentially but up 8% versus a year ago on better performance, higher U.S. equity market volumes and higher average volatility.
Securities services net revenues of $439 million were flat sequentially and rose 9% versus last year, reflecting higher average client balances as we continue to invest to expand our footprint in the business.
On a year-to-date basis, our equities I&L businesses generated $3.5 billion of net revenues, roughly 60% from corporate investments and 40% from real estate.
We continue to reinvest to drive future long-term performance, with 46% of the investments in the portfolio made in the last four years.
Next, turning to Investment Management, we posted net revenues of $1.7 billion in the third quarter, driven by continued growth in our asset management and private wealth businesses.
We emphasize paying for performance to attract and retain the best talent and investment spending to support our clients while building technology, infrastructure and platforms to grow the firm for the future.
Roughly 55% of the increase versus last year continued to be from expenses related to client activity and investments for growth, including approximately $425 million across markets, our consolidated investments and technology; and approximately $190 million from higher brokerage, clearing and exchange fees.
Overall, 40 basis points of the improvement was driven by an increase in common shareholdersÃÂÃÂ equity and reduced market RWAs. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 6%, up 20 basis points versus the second quarter.
Our solid double-digit year-to-date revenue increase demonstrates the capabilities in each of our client businesses, and we continue to work hard to grow further from here.
First, in terms of the pace of activity in Marcus, we have been underwriting and reunderwriting this business from the first quarter ÃÂÃÂ we began in the fourth quarter of 2016 ÃÂÃÂ and at each moment, taking stock of where we are, mindful of being potentially late in the consumer cycle.
One other thought, we had mentioned this in the past that itÃÂÃÂs important, as we expand the firm and grow our businesses and we emphasize lending and also platforms, increasingly, our focus is turning away from comp-to-net revenue ratio, where ÃÂÃÂ which has historically been a topic on these calls, and really to efficiency ratio overall where weÃÂÃÂre looking at comp and non-comp expenses holistically with the focus on profitability.
Just wanted to get your take on what you guys are seeing, some of the ÃÂÃÂ maybe the market share opportunities that you have set out over a year ago, how thatÃÂÃÂs playing out and how much of that is either from like a competitive standpoint versus maybe some of the technology initiatives that you guys have been investing in that maybe you guys have more of a competitive advantage than some others.
And weÃÂÃÂre leading in those extremely competitive businesses with content, scale and making it all client-centric and investing to modernize it with digital access, digital formats of many kinds, digital user experiences, over the Web, same tools that our people use, deploying them to clients, also giving clients the abilities to plug indirectly into our platform through APIs, which is very much a theme for us as well as all companies that are building and deploying technology for their clients.
And weÃÂÃÂve seen, since 2016, about 180 basis points market share growth in low touch and half of that in the year-to-date.
Just given what you guys have done to build out the Investing & Lending business and the makeup today, just how much will the public market volatility, maybe wider credit spreads impact it versus sort of the core lending growth?
I guess if you could share just an update on the growth initiatives you guys outlined to expand the customer footprint and kind of where you are in the ability to pick up an extra billion dollars of revenues over the next couple of years.
And there, again, itÃÂÃÂs taking the tools that weÃÂÃÂve developed for ourselves and sharing them very broadly with clients in a variety of formats, including for many clients who want to just plug in through APIs and get our data sets and risk analytics directly and plug into their computers, doing this all while optimizing our resources, managing our liquidity capital and expenses.
So you see capital increase by virtue of retained earnings, and you look at the speed with which we turned velocity on the commitments made so that commitments are not sitting on the book for an extended time, all of these are inputs and variables that I think say a lot about the businessÃÂÃÂ ability to adapt.
So in that context, acquisitions around our Consumer business have been made, and I think weÃÂÃÂll continue to make them.
I think equally in the context of the Investment Management Division, historically, you have seen us make small acquisitions in that context because you can pick up teams or assets or sort of extend yourself into adjacent businesses.
Unsecured lending in the Marcus platform being one, but equally, the value of deposits in that franchise being another, and then there may well be other opportunities that present themselves in terms of new business between now and then.
I guess the point IÃÂÃÂm making is that when you look at the loan component that makes up a number of different inputs to that target, our ambition is not to stretch through the target, meaning weÃÂÃÂre not going to let that business sort of grow because the target is out there in terms of balance sheet.
And finally, IÃÂÃÂd say ÃÂÃÂ and an example of this would be the nascent plans now around corporate cash management, which is I view us as having an extraordinary set of relationships with corporates to sort of look and build that business on a technology platform that will be rather edgy.
So just imagine, when you look at the strength of the Investment Banking business and you find us in number one positions across a range of different products, imagine us extending that product set now to corporate cash management and other similar such businesses, and I think the opportunity there is fairly extensive growth in areas that weÃÂÃÂve not played in before.
So as I said, I think, in response to a question earlier, our reserve build has been commensurate with loan growth, and itÃÂÃÂs not a function of any perceived deterioration in the book itself.
But equally and to your question, capitalÃÂÃÂs a scarce resource, and we need to ensure that capital is being allocated appropriately to businesses that can hurdle what we care to hold out for them in the context of ways in which we can serve customers and clients.
And so what I find positive in that and a guide toward where we will be is that weÃÂÃÂre going to look to continue to fund our growth from within the business and all the while produce operating leverage in the business.
Longer term, I think we should hold ourselves out to even greater efficiencies because platforms will become more mature, delivery of product across all of our businesses will be more efficiently delivered, and youÃÂÃÂll start to see pickup at the top line by virtue of the investment in the growth initiatives themselves.
I think that weÃÂÃÂre particularly well positioned to do that in the context of the adjacency that exists between our Investment Management Division and Marcus, where we have an extraordinary factory floor in GSAM that can build and develop product.
And so I offer this out not just to give you an indication of what the platform might look like, what the forward road map might be with respect to product, but equally to sort of let you in on the adjacencies and channels and opportunities that exist around Goldman Sachs that can serve in the growth of what we try to build with respect to consumers.
Now over the last several years, if you look at the cash and derivatives contribution to equities client execution, itÃÂÃÂs evenly balanced, though it can, of course, change from quarter-to-quarter.
IÃÂÃÂd answer your question without limit to any particular division, meaning if I look at Investment Banking, as part of the growth initiatives with the 2020 target, we set out to open offices in a number of different cities, where we had not formally been and to look to expand the client base, because thereÃÂÃÂs very attractive, accretive business to be had in and among those clients.

goldmansachs,q4,2018,"We remain committed to delivering a full range of services to our clients, including advice, market liquidity, investment management and financing.
As many of you know, John, Stephen and I are conducting a comprehensive front-to-back review across each of our businesses, including 3-year forward plans to identify opportunities to strengthen or expand our client footprint and to operate more efficiently.
Starting with our market-making business in FICC and Equities, we've spent a significant amount of time, evaluating all aspects of our businesses, including our delivery model, with a focus on providing best-in-class client experience and execution.
We are also actively engaged in pursuing opportunities to grow our addressable market by broadening client relationships and improving our mix of products, services, particularly the corporates.
As we evaluated opportunities to improve services to our clients and expand our franchise, cash management presents an illogical area for us given the breadth of our corporate relationships and the size of that wallet.
Across these and other investments for growth, combined with a significant focus on operating efficiency, we are beginning to deliver on our commitment to enhance the durability of our revenues and our earnings.
Importantly, we are making significant investments to further expand our client franchise, grow revenues and enhance the long-term earnings profile of the firm, the cost of which is being funded by the embedded operating leverage in our businesses.
The team I have assembled to execute on our priorities, including John and Stephen, have an increased sense of urgency and discipline to help move our business forward.
The firm reported fourth quarter net revenues of $8.1 billion, resulting in $36.6 billion for the full year.
In the fourth quarter, the business produced net revenues of $2 billion, up 3% versus the third quarter as a significant pickup in M&A completions helped offset a decline in underwriting revenues as the difficult market backdrop slowed issuance volumes globally.
For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7.9 billion, up 7% from 2017 on increases in both Financial Advisory and Underwriting.
The strong performance reflects our continued focus on building long-term client relationships and our ongoing investment in talent and capabilities.
For the full year, ICS generated $13.5 billion of net revenues, up 13% compared to 2017, driven by healthier volumes, better wallet share and improved execution in certain of our businesses, notably in commodities.
FICC client execution net revenues were $822 million in the fourth quarter, down 18% versus 2017 amid challenging market conditions, particularly in credit and, to a lesser extent, in rates.
Commissions and fees were 9% higher, attributable to increased client activity, following the significant uptick in volatility, particularly in low touch where we continue to gain market share.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting continued strong results in private equity investments.
For the full year, equity Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $4.5 billion.
We continue to reinvest to drive future long-term performance, with 47% of the investments in the portfolio made in the last 4 years.
The business remains well positioned for growth as we continue to invest in people and make bolt-on acquisitions to enhance our product offering to better serve our clients.
For the full year, other operating expenses rose 20%, and roughly half of the increase related to client activity and investments for growth.
But I think the important element to convey on that side is that there's a long history in the investing side, particularly in equity, in both sourcing interesting and sometimes unique opportunities for businesses that demonstrate stability and growth trajectory.
And when you look at that opportunity and you compare what would be significant growth for us compared to other people that are in that business given our platform, our investing resources and our capability to manage money for institutional and individual clients, we have meaningful growth without setting overly ambitious targets.
I would ask you to sort of rely more on the progression and the stability and sustainability of this business just in terms of what it has produced for many, many quarters over several years in the context of the investing.
Part of what I wanted to point out in answering the prior question is that there's a good deal here of realized gain in the book and a continual velocity turn in the portfolio, and sales or partial sales sort of are one part of that.
But just when you think about some of the investments that you guys have been making in some of the new growth initiatives on the technology side, how should we be thinking about the run rate going into '19 and '20 in an environment where obviously the market has been a bit more volatile more recently?
All of the investment spend in the different projects that David and I have been talking about, whether that's in Marcus or whether that's corporate cash management or whether that's the building incremental platforms inside the securities and trading business, is in that $892 million.
My view is that the rate of growth in that expense, while it will grow, the rate of growth will be less than the rate of growth that we saw in '18, and we're going to continue to look to deploy existing operating leverage in the business as a source of that investment spend in the business overall.
Obviously, we're cognizant of the way the market is looking at our business mix, and we're also cognizant of the performance of the stock.
If 3 to 5 years ago, we said on one of these calls that in 2018, we would have a year where our FICC ICS revenues were less than $6 billion, we were making significant investments in building out a digital consumer platform and we happened to be in a situation where we had [indiscernible] litigation expense that we would deliver $36.6 billion of revenues and a 13.3% return, people would have said, not possible.
And the reason that that's happened is we have been working for a number of years to broaden our business, expand our addressable wallet and, at the same point in time, increase the durability of our revenues.
And as we're developing a plan to move forward, we see things we can do in the existing businesses and adjacent build, some of which we mentioned, where we feel very confidently that we can continue to push returns higher, especially if we also continue to be focused on running the firm more efficiently, which as Stephen stated, we're very committed to doing.
The one thing that I said in my comments that I just want to reiterate is we accept the size of the wallet share that exists, and it's our job to run the business well based on that wallet share to allocate capital over time efficiently and to run that business in an effective way from a cost perspective, and we continue to do that while continuing to invest in the client franchise.
And you are absolutely right to point out that our increased market share, and David was referring to it, among institutional clients has not, in the last couple of years, demonstrated revenue conversion.
And it's against that addressable market that we're going to take and are taking in part of -- as part of the front to back of U.S. to the proper expense size against that wallet and against that TAM, the amount of debt and liquidity we need to put against that business, the amount of risk that we need to take on in the context of intermediating risk for clients and then, ultimately, the amount of capital to put against it.
I mean, I think the quantification that I can give you is really sort of part of what I was responding to in terms of Christian's question, which is in the last five years, as I said, we've taken expense down 30%, RWAs by 40% and reallocation of capital.
And I'm not hesitating other than part of the front-to-back review that we are engaged in right now is to answer the very question you're asking, which is, again, understand the addressable market, including an expanded set of customers and clients that we will focus on and then being quite clear about what our taking that market can be and then the inputs to driving that business, whether it's expenses, liquidity, capital and otherwise.
But there does continue to be some questions, I think, among investors and analysts about the need for a bigger deal to help balance out the business.
I think you'll continue to see a few smaller add-on opportunities across our businesses, particularly when you look at asset management and wealth management.
But it's our job as a management team to be well-versed on any opportunity that we think can advance our returns and our cost for shareholders, and we'll operate that way as we move forward.
So in the context of corporate cash management, you'll remember that our interest in this was in part a view that when we look at sort of the most significant relationships that we had in Investment Banking across those corporates that they were paying a considerable amount to the market, almost equal to that, that they pay in the market in which we participate, namely our Advisory and Underwriting business, but they were paying in and around Treasury services and corporate cash management.
I'd also point out, just as an aside, that the first customer of this platform, in fact, will be Goldman Sachs such that we can reduce the cost of our own operational deposits outside of the bank, and I think in the process, de-risk the firm from that perspective.
So I think if you look historically from the time that we acquired the GE deposit platform in the U.S., I would say that the beta was lower than where it's going, meaning it'll remain lower than one, but in the rate environment in which we were in, it was very little by way of movement and rate.
I mean, our view on efficiency ratio and the migration there is that we need to look across all expenses, particularly as we're building out sort of more platform-driven businesses, which will be less compensation, if you will, expense intensive and more operationally intensive.
Just one follow-up as it relates to some of your comments on the marginal margin improving, and I know it was a little more than a year ago when you initially laid out those growth targets on the revenue side of $5 billion.
As shown on Page 2, it is important to underscore that our overarching priority is to execute our core mission: Serving our diverse client franchise, which includes corporations and governments, institutions and individuals; executing on our client-centric model will drive long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders.
Over recent years, we've made significant progress on improving capital utilization and reallocating capital away from FICC commensurate with its potential in order to grow strategically, important and higher returning businesses.
Based on our track record, there is an opportunity to raise additional third-party funds across equity, credit and real estate, thereby augmenting fee income.
A concern that central banks would continue to tighten into a slowing growth environment cause weakness in equity and credit markets and resulted in an increase in volatility of many macro assets.
While this has created challenges for many of our institutional investing clients, it is also driving potential future opportunities for active managers to add value.
In addition for now the absolute level of activity in the real economy remains fairly robust, and this is reflected in broad CEO sentiment and our Investment Banking transaction backlog.
The first 3 quarters demonstrated continued strength in global equity and credit markets despite geopolitical uncertainty.
The fourth quarter witnessed higher levels of market volatility, increased client engagement and negative performance across virtually all asset classes.
Market volatility, declining equity prices and wider credit spreads weighed on issuer sentiment as net revenues were down 21% sequentially in the fourth quarter to $843 million.
Our Investment Banking franchise overall remains very well positioned and continues to grow.
We are ending 2018 with an Investment Banking backlog meaningfully higher than where we finished 2017, notwithstanding a decline versus last quarter.
The remaining decrease reflected lower results in rates while the other FICC businesses were relatively consistent with last year's performance.
Second, we remained focused on leveraging our best-in-class Investment Banking relationships to better serve corporate clients.
Equities client execution net revenues were up significantly versus a challenged fourth quarter of 2017, with better performance in cash.
Our share of global equity market volumes increased by over 100 basis points versus 2017 and included growth across all regions, reflecting a multiyear positive trend.
For the full year, assets under supervision increased $48 billion resulting from $37 billion of long-term net inflows primarily in fixed income and equity assets and $52 billion of net inflows into liquidity products.
The improvement in the advanced ratio reflected 80 basis points related to lower credit risk weighted assets due to inclusion of the firm's default experience into the determination of probability of default calculation.

To drive long-term shareholder value, our strategy sets up three primary objectives; first, we aim to strengthen our existing businesses; second, we aim to diversify our business mix with new services to expand our opportunity set and increase the durability of our revenues; and third, we aim to operate more efficiently and effectively across all aspects, including expenses, financing and capital.
To achieve these objectives, we will endeavor to deliver one-Goldman Sachs to our clients; we will focus on growth where there is an adjacency to our existing businesses; we will expand our addressable market to deliver more products to existing and new clients; and we will pursue this expansion, via investments in talent, technology and platforms, all the while our emphasis will be on transparency with our stakeholders.
Ultimately, we believe the strategy will allow us to serve more clients with differentiated products and services, increase the durability and predictability of our earnings profile, deliver improved profitability, optimize our capital and deliver higher long-term returns to shareholders.
Last fall, as you know, we began a process of re-underwriting each of our businesses, including the development of three year plans for the firm.
Instead, this is an effort to invest in talent, technology, platforms and straight through processing to drive new sources of revenue, improve efficiency and drive higher margins.
Lastly, these efforts will help us to better serve corporate clients across the firm, including in adjacent areas like ICS and investment management.
However, our reviews have identified opportunities to cut expenses and capital from certain underperforming parts of the commodities business and increase investments in others.
Pivoting to investment management, we continue to grow assets under supervision in key strategic areas, including advisory, outsource CIO and ETFs, as well as in our world-class ultrahigh network business where we have modest share in a very fragmented market.
Overtime, as I mentioned earlier, we will seek to reduce the capital intensity of this business by managing more client assets in fund form and reducing our balance sheet investments.
We're also making a number of changes to reduce cost and drive long-term operating leverage by increasing use of shared platforms across our business, and migrating more of our efforts to locations like Bengaluru, Warsaw, Dallas and Salt Lake City.
Before moving to discuss the quarter, let me turn to Page 9, where we layout a roadmap for what to expect in the coming quarters in terms of performance targets, financial disclosure and a broader discussing of the strategic way forward for Goldman Sachs.
On Page 16, turning to investment management, we produced $1.6 billion of revenues in the first quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading PWM franchise.
For the quarter, our efficiency ratio was approximately 67%, up 100 basis point versus year ago largely driven by lower revenues.
Combined with our investment in platforms and scale this positions us to create significant value for the clients we serve and solid long-term return to our shareholders.
And as I said on the last call and we will continue to say forward our view is that we will encourage people to look at overall expenses both comp and non-comp, particularly as we roll out and build platforms that will yield higher marginal margin and that ultimately are less consumptive of comp intensive expense so much as OpEx intensive expense.
First question just on activity levels, I think one of the challenges is during the quarter, obviously, week first half and then that's improved but I think some of the things that you guys mentioned in terms of M&A, the pipeline weaker just given what completed but ECM better.
So just wanted to get a sense on what areas of the business you think can reverse relatively quickly versus what areas you may take a bit longer for that confidence to come back to where we were, say in September of last year?
In terms of market activity and client engagement, we saw significant pickup in the second half of the quarter.
Michael, the only thing I would add to David's comment is that I think in equities, we're seeing and saw over the quarter month-by-month increases in prime balances, which speaks to an increasing level of activity.
And I think if you look at the equity I&L line, though it doesn't necessarily skew to where the public equity markets fit, I think there is obviously the opportunity to take advantage of a positive environment just in terms of event driven valuation and the like as we play forward.
First, I think when you look at the efficiency ratio obviously it was up on the quarter, which was more reflection of revenues being down than it is expenses, because expenses obviously came down.
I think when you look at investments that are being made over the course of '19 and '20, we have a view as we're now developing three year models as to when we'll see or begin to see efficiency play through.
As a general matter, we are looking to make changes in the way in which we're engaging in FIC, all with an eye toward generating considering more revenue for the division and at the same time, optimizing to the deployment of capital and reducing down expense.
I would also say that if you look across all of the businesses within FIC, each of them has their own orientation and the work we're doing both to generate capital, consume less capital and equally be more efficient in terms of expense.
So for example, the Europe business has been in the bank, it benefits from lower cost funding that sits in the bank and we're looking at ways in which we can be more efficient in the deployment of capital.
I think what we've seen based on other efforts in this space is that this likely will be some mixed approach in the context of both technology and human engagement.
The way in which we look at overall trade flow from the beginning through to the middle and in the context of collateral management through to settlement, the place of operations in that chain now matters more than it's ever mattered in the past in the context of our engagement and the question of customer satisfaction and client satisfaction with the business.
I think that you have to expect if you just look at the size and the scale of their more traditional banking operations and their consumer banking operation, it's going be more elevated than their businesses.
And if you look at the growth rate of it, it's going to continue to push higher and it's much more sustainable in some of gains that you get in and out any the quarter in the other part of the business.
But we aim to be more disclosive going forward in terms of the overall context of disclosure around our investment spend in these various technologies.
As I mentioned earlier, client adjacent lending that serves a number of different businesses around the firm.
These elements are critical to our key growth platforms, including Marcus and mass affluent wealth where we will pursue partnerships to access large numbers of consumers; Marquee, our digital institutional platform where the ability to innovate can help us engage at scale with our institutional client base; and corporate cash management, where we can serve existing clients to the firm and offer differentiated products on a digital platform.
For our franchise, there is significant value in serving these clients, including lower deposit funding costs and additional foreign exchange revenues.
In credit where synergies with Investment Banking facilitate our high rankings in both trading and underwriting, we are building models and tools to facilitate faster inventory turnover and reduce drawdown risk as we execute client flows.
Finally, through our one-Goldman Sachs initiative, we aim to shift focus away from per trade returns, taking a more holistic approach to client relationships.
As I mentioned, alternatives is a key focus where client demand remains very strong with over $1.5 trillion of capital raised industry wide in the past five years.
Based on last year's results for every 100 basis points in efficiency ratio reduction we achieve, it equates to approximately $300 million of net income and a 40 basis point increase in ROE all else equal.
Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.8 billion down 11% versus the solid fourth quarter and flat versus a year ago as very strong advisory performance offset a sharp decline in underwriting.
Financial advisory revenues were $887 million, up 51% versus last year, driven by our leading market share.
Equity underwriting net revenues of $271 million declined sharply versus last year, driven by a lack of IPO activity.
Our Investment Banking backlog decreased versus the fourth quarter as revenues were realized.
FIC client execution net revenues were $1.8 billion in the first quarter, more than doubling fourth quarter levels, reflecting a better operating environment.
Results were impacted by significantly lower performance in derivatives, given lower market volatility versus the first quarter of 2018 when volatility was elevated and client activity was robust.
Commissions and fees net revenues were $714 million, driven by lower client volumes versus both last quarter and versus a year ago.
Securities services net revenues of $370 million fell by 14% year-over-year amid lower average client balances as hedge funds deleveraged, though balances have been recovering.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $847 million, reflecting net gains from private and public equities, company specific events and corporate performance.
As I have commented on the last earnings call, this seeming inconsistency is because our portfolio skews more to private securities than public holdings as shown on the slide, and there were less event driven valuation remarks of our private equity holdings.
Our global equity portfolio was $22 billion at quarter end and remains well diversified with roughly 1,000 different investments.
Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.6 trillion, up $57 billion versus the fourth quarter, driven by $20 billion of long-term net inflows in fixed income strategies and $59 billion of market appreciation, that being partially offset by $22 billion of liquidity product outflows.
Our total operating expenses decreased by 11% versus the first quarter of last year, reflecting lower compensation and benefits expense and lower activity related brokerage clearing exchange fees.
The ratios improved by 40 and 30 basis points respectively versus year end, driven by higher retained earnings.
[Operator instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
So you outlined efforts to increase fee-based recurring revenues and reduced the volatility in that principle investment line.
One of the interesting comments that was made is that you noted this would be ROE accretive overtime, which is something that many investors have questioned just given the significant gains generated within equity I&L.
I think that it's important to understand this transition as just that, which is a transition away from the balance sheet intensive investing to one which is predicated largely on managing third-party money and generating fee revenue, which itself will dampen P&L volatility and be less consumptive of balance sheet is going to take time.
So in the deck and in your remarks, you noted that $10 billion plus deposit growth target for year with that 100 basis point spread benefit by replacing higher cost wholesale funds with lower cost deposits.
Our next question is from the line of Michael Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Make no mistake that bring together Marcus with our investment management division had a strategic component to it, which was we were a business that for many, many years obviously managed funds and managed asset for high net worth individuals.
So first question here just on the mass affluent opportunity within Marcus, Ayco and other firm had corporate relationships, seem to provide a very strong customer acquisition channel.
",36.76,0.76974535
goldmansachs,q2,2019,"Switching gears, I'd like to provide some insights on two important strategic decisions we made in the second quarter and our alternatives in wealth management businesses.
Upon closing the transaction today, United Capital will become a powerful complement to our Ayco business, our leading financial executive counseling and investment advisory business, which serves many of the largest corporations in the United States.
Moving on to Page 4, Investment Banking produce net revenues of $1.9 billion, 3% versus the first quarter and down 9% versus a robust year ago quarter.
Moving to Institutional Client Services on Page 5, net revenues were solid at $3.5 billion in the second quarter down 3% versus last year, as our diversified business experienced low client activity in FICC, offset by strength in equities.
The environment notwithstanding and as I have said previously, we are investing heavily to automate our workflows, serve our clients electronically, monitor our cost base and deliver structured solutions in capital efficient formats.
Net revenues for the second quarter were $2 billion, up 14% sequentially and up 6% versus a year ago.
On Page 9 turning to Investment Management, we produced $1.6 billion of revenues in the second quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading Private Wealth franchise.
Incentive fees in the second quarter of last year were driven by the timing of realizations and performance across a variety of our alternative investment funds.
Also as we have noted in the past, as we grow more scale and platform driven businesses, it is our expectation that compensation will decline as a proportion of total operating expenses and the efficiency ratio will become a more relevant measure for the firm.
While we continue to assess capital return in the context of the market environment and opportunities for accretive investment in our business consistent with our long-held strategy, we are encouraged by the increased flexibility afforded by our strong capital position.
That said we continue to value the flexibility of share repurchases as they allow us to be more dynamic with capital allocations based on the environment and business opportunities.
We have spent a lot of time thinking about it because when you look at these businesses which in the past had been organized over multiple parts of the firm.
We have said publicly that when you look at the businesses that we operate here collectively, they make us one of the top five alternative asset managers in the world today.
So I think it's fair to say as a general matter this year CCAR clearly demonstrates the direction of travel that we want to go in terms of overall capital return.
And I think what played out in the context of CCAR is a reflection of what we are comfortable with in terms of what we're going to look to put out given where the market and circumstances are.
On the question you raised about FICC, the focus for FICC not borne of this quarter in particular, but since we came on and started to look and re-underwrite the business has been around capital efficiency and equally cost in the context of delivering into our clients.
When you look at FICC in particular, I would say that the business is focused on clients in the context of expanding out the corporates, transaction banking and the like.
We're going to continue to look at ways of accomplishing that and greater capital and cost efficiency.
Just given some of the investments and in the longer term to focus on the efficiency ratio, just wanted to get an update or run through some of the initiatives that are in place, and the progress you guys are making to lower the cost base and over time and improve the efficiency ratio.
These two are lowering the throughput of trades, it's lowering the ability or I should say the price point to engage with clients where they want to meet us, which is it's less human capital, it's more platform driven; it carries higher efficiency to it and that's the direction of travel.
On the expense base, I think in the near term there is sort of quick to be realized certain cost efficiencies in our trading costs, meaning what's happening on platforms that are introduced that underpin incumbent businesses that are not looking for, if you will, new flows to command, but we're transacting with clients in a different manner and form than what we've done in the past, just one really small example.
Now we're able to provide a platform where the client can engage and look to conform and develop a portfolio on a much more efficient basis cost sufficient basis than what has happened in the past.
But this is a risk business and we'll continue to look at it as we grow it out on a risk-adjusted return basis.
So if you have a 60/40 mix and market intermediation is softer, which it clearly was given the environment we had this quarter, your NIM portion or your non market intermediation portion has less volatility, but we continue to make investments as you highlight in some of these products and particularly in broadening out the client base, I'd ask Stephen to provide just a little bit more detail on how we think some of that's point through.
So the way we've been looking at it as we've been scrutinizing and re underwriting that business is we're focused on both the numerator and the denominator of the ROE calculation, meaning it's important that nobody lose focus that we need to mind how much revenue is coming in, i.e. how do we want to define the tangible market that we face.
First question just on the United Capital with the deal closing, just look to maybe get a little more perspective on how you're thinking about the business opportunity.
And we are in the process of that and as those plans come forward we will be more communicative and transparent as to what expectation we think you can have with that business over time.
And I think this business continues that secular growth and so as the environment evolves, I think there will be periods of time where we will see increased activity versus what we've seen in the first half of the year.
David will start with a high level review of our financial performance, the current operating environment, give an update on several recent strategy decisions and discuss our stress test results.
We reported second quarter 2019 revenues of $9.5 billion, down slightly versus last year, but nonetheless reflecting solid franchise performance amid a mixed operating environment.
Our equity market making business delivered its second highest quarter in four years, and our franchise continues to generate broad based market share gains across regions.
We produced the quarterly I&L revenues in eight years, aided by significant gains from our private equity investment - investing activities reflecting our ability to source opportunities for the firm and our clients, and record net interest income in debt I&L which annualizes the $3.5 billion.
Turning to Page 2, our second quarter results were generated on an operating backdrop that presented both opportunities and challenges.
In response, equity volatility then increased; global markets turned risk off, the US yield curve inverted, and client activity slowed across a variety of products as our corporate and investment clients stayed on the sidelines.
On a combined basis, Ayco and United Capital will serve clients with over $80 billion of assets under supervision, representing a strong base from which to grow our mass affluent wealth franchise.
This change reflects the board and management view that dividend growth is a critical component to delivering strong shareholder returns, and reflects our progress over recent years increasing more durable fee-based revenues to support the higher dividend.
Moving to underwriting, equity underwriting net revenues of $482 million improves significantly versus the first quarter which experienced the government shutdown and held roughly flat versus a strong quarter last year.
Year-to-date, we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting supported by $16 billion of deal volume across over 100 transactions this quarter.
The second quarter last year included a number of significant contributions from investment grade and leveraged finance activity, which did not repeat to the same extent this quarter.
Our deal flows in this quarter were consistent with trends across the industry, which reflected materially lower volumes in the loan market and lower activity in acquisition related financings, particularly with financial sponsors.
And while markets can change quickly, we are optimistic that our clients will remain active in executing strategic transactions in the coming quarters given healthy levels of client dialogue and continued need to access financing markets.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the second quarter, down 13% year-over-year reflecting both the mix operating environment and generally lower client activity despite notable strength in Europe.
We saw lower structured finance client activity versus a year ago, while closing credit came alongside a more muted origination backdrop particularly in investment grade debt and leveraged loans as I had mentioned earlier.
We believe our success reflects our continuing consolidation of global market share and a dedication to serving clients across a full suite of cash, derivatives and prime services in both hi touch and low touch channels.
Equities client execution net revenues of $772 million increased 13% relative to the first quarter and were up 12% versus a year ago.
Equity securities generated robust net revenues of $1.5 billion, driven by company specific events like IPOs and the performance of corporates in the portfolio contributing revaluations.
Second quarter results were up 20% versus a year ago, primarily reflecting higher net gains from public equities.
Turning to Page 8, net revenues from Debt Securities and Loans were $989 million, included $872 million of net interest income and modest mark-to-market gains.
Net revenues included management and other fees of $1.4 billion which were up 5% versus the first quarter and up 4% versus last year, reflecting continued growth in assets under supervision.
Our total operating expenses of $6.1 billion were flat versus the second quarter of last year, reflecting lower litigation and lower compensation and benefits expense, offset by increased expense for technology and consolidated investments.
Our year-to-date efficiency ratio was 65.6%, up 100 basis points versus a year ago, driven by lower revenues and ongoing investments, partially offset by lower compensation expense.
Year-to-date, the total pretax cost from Markus, Apple Card and our new transaction banking platform is approximately $275 million resulting in a drag of roughly 60 basis points on our ROE.
The ratio is each increased by 10 basis points versus the first quarter driven by higher retained earnings.
Our global core liquid assets averaged $225 billion during the quarter, which we continue to note may decline as we have opportunities to support client demand.
While our second quarter performance was solid despite the mixed operating environment, we believe as David said, the overall economic growth backdrop should remain supportive of our business.
In I&L, I'm curious I know you're going through the process of consolidating the businesses and I'm sure there's some challenges there, but my question is on you've always been good at this but I feel like managing conflicts between advisor, balance sheet investment, and third party funds will just even be that much harder as you bring this all together and grow third party.
As David pointed out and it's also worth noting that different sleeves whether it's credit, real estate with respect to for example equity carry different capital density and the opportunity to realize higher returns on the balance sheet deployed will be there.
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
How much of the strong NII growth that you guys have seen over the past few years has been balanced versus rate?
Your next question comes from a line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
",37.68,0.75593966
goldmansachs,q3,2019,"David will start with a high-level review of our financial performance and the operating environment, heÃÂÃÂll then provide a brief update on several strategy items including key investments we are making to drive future growth, the significance of the Applecart launch, specifically, as it relates to other technology innovation at the firm and recent personnel changes to align with our longer-term strategic priorities.
In investment banking despite lower results versus a strong third quarter in 2018, we continue to have the worldÃÂÃÂs leading franchise, ranking Number 1 in global announced and completed M&A and Number 1 in equity underwriting year-to-date.
These investments reflect our deliberate and disciplined approach in building new scalable businesses to serve a broader set of clients, including our markets consumer business, the recently launched Apple Card and a new transaction banking platform.
Starting on Page 4, Investment Banking produced net revenues of 1.7 billion, down 9% versus the second quarter and down 15% versus a strong year-ago quarter.
While the recent market reception for certain companies has been less favorable, over the long term, we believe investors will continue to invest in growing, innovative, and disruptive businesses that create value for customers and shareholders.
Given our healthy levels of strategic dialogues, our expanding client footprint, and the nature of our corporate relationships, we continue to be optimistic that our clients will remain active in executing transactions supported by well-functioning and liquid capital markets.
Moving to Institutional Client Services on Page 5, net revenues were solid at $3.3 billion in the third quarter, up 6% versus last year, driven by growth across our diversified FICC and equities businesses, and as David noted at the start, reflective of progress made across our businesses in terms of our clients and business mix and the development of electronic platforms.
Our equity investments generated net revenues of $662 million, down significantly versus last year, driven in part by a reduction in market value on our public investment portfolio.
On Page 9, turning to investment management, we produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the third quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading private wealth franchise.
Also, as we have noted previously, as we grow more platform-driven businesses, we expect compensation to decline as a portion of total operating expenses making our total efficiency ratio a more relevant metric for the firm.
As David discussed earlier, we continue to invest in a number of important initiatives across the firm both to build new businesses and digital platforms, as well as to enhance the firm's infrastructure.
To provide you some measure of that investment, a meaningful driver of the year-to-date growth in non-compensation expenses relates to firm-wide technology spending and expenses related to four key projects, Marcus, Apple Card, Transaction Banking, and United Capital.
Year-to-date, the total pre-tax impact of our organic projects, Marcus, Apple Card and Transaction Banking is approximately $450 million, resulting in a drag of roughly 60 basis points on our ROE.
We actually saw some opportunity to work with clients in the context of that and deploy balance sheet, and I think you framed it correctly, there's still work to do to move forward with respect to the short-term funding markets.
Thanks for the question, Christian and I ÃÂÃÂ you know I think, I understand, IÃÂÃÂd try to put it in, you know what, through the cycle context and also short-term context.
But as Stephen clearly articulated on the call, there has been about a 60-basis point drain on our ROE year-to-date given the investments that weÃÂÃÂre making across our three principal projects, the card, our markets digital consumer banking platform and also transaction services.
IÃÂÃÂd also point out that as the portfolio around Apple Card grows in throughout 2020, obviously weÃÂÃÂre building that reserve from, you know, a base of zero as it relates to the credit card portfolio itself.
Just wanted to get, you know, your perspective on like how youÃÂÃÂre thinking about that business going forward in terms of third-party funds?
Sure, Michael and, you know, I think we talked about this a little bit on the last call, but we see the opportunity for us as a significant manager of alternative assets both for ourselves and for our clients at the time ÃÂÃÂ at the current time, an opportunity for us to meaningfully grow the client fees that we have.
As I think we stated publicly before, and we talked last time that we were on the call, we will continue to invest balance sheet capital and people should not see or expect in the short-term a change in with respect to the way we deploy balance sheet, but over time the medium and long-term as we evolve this business and grow other revenue streams, weÃÂÃÂll certainly reconsider that and we evaluate what we think is appropriate.
So, I wanted to just start with a follow up to one of ChristianÃÂÃÂs earlier questions, itÃÂÃÂs one that weÃÂÃÂve been fielding from a number investors as well, which is this concern that you have a long timeline before some of the newer growth initiatives achieve scale, suggesting it could, a lot of time can pass before we actually see the benefits to the P&L.
WeÃÂÃÂre taking the opportunity to grow more fee-based durable recurring revenues, but that will take some time and weÃÂÃÂre thinking about building those businesses in the medium and long term for Goldman Sachs over a long period of time.
You know we think about getting real contributions from some of these investments that weÃÂÃÂre making over the next three to five years, but I understand in the context of short-term catalysts that that might feel like a long time.
Steven, the one other thing I'll add to DavidÃÂÃÂs comments is around funding optimization and liquidity management, which I think will yield much shorter-term benefit to the firm overall and that work, you know, has already begun.
I think all of those in addition to what David was speaking about in terms of efficiency and overall operating expenses will be two near-term elements that I think people can look to, you know, in the context of a longer-term profile to some of the bigger investments.
WeÃÂÃÂre building ÃÂÃÂ to the second part of your question in investment platform for the long run, private investment ÃÂÃÂ private investment, alternative investment activities, whether it's private equity or credit or infrastructure or growth capital, I think despite the fact that there can be dialogue around evolutions in that business or potential regulation of certain aspects of that, that will not change the opportunity in those businesses for us over a long period of time.
Two questions, one you cited the deposit is $55 billion, you know, obviously a very large number that youÃÂÃÂve been able to generate over the course of last couple of years in Marcus and others.
If we continue to do that over time and if over time because the investments that we make add more fee-based or durable revenue to our business mix and weÃÂÃÂre able therefore to move all the turns higher, I do believe over the time the market will reward us.
I think, Mike, maybe to address the question of timeline, so, you know, not all of these initiatives, you know, operate in the same set of time sequence.
You know what we've built to this point in three years, you know, is effectively a bank that has $55 billion of the deposits and $5 billion in loans and a new credit card platform thatÃÂÃÂs begun with Apple, but that can go in a variety of different places and partnerships.
Shorter-term, I would say you could look at, for example, transaction banking, where, you know, that platform is one where, as weÃÂÃÂve said several times, we are the first customer.
So right now, you know, weÃÂÃÂve processed more than $250 billion of payments for Goldman Sachs through that platform and equally we are on schedule to bring very consequential corporate clients to the firm onto that platform and I think given the nature of that spend, its ability to borrow on some of the technology that was built on the consumer side, you know, weÃÂÃÂll have a much faster sort of payback, if you will, relative to the longer cycle around consumer.
And so, when you think about a deal, I know you probably wouldnÃÂÃÂt want to talk about anything specific in a particular space, but how would you balance assessing tangible book regulatory capital hits versus long-term growth and maybe attractiveness of low-cost deposits and other benefits like that?
Well, itÃÂÃÂs difficult to predict kind of the forward trend because obviously, you know, weÃÂÃÂll be mindful of where the markets are and what risk looks like in the context of taking on accretive lending opportunities.
You know in the last year the run rate of net interest income that we are taking in on the book has gone from $2.8 billion on an annualized basis to $3.6 billion looking at the near $900 million that was generated in the quarter.
The approval rates early on have been lower and IÃÂÃÂd say that thatÃÂÃÂs a decision obviously Goldman Sachs is making as the bank, but weÃÂÃÂre doing that in concert with Apple and it is because weÃÂÃÂre quite vigilant from a risk point of view, but not being negatively selected out-of-the-box, meaning over time, weÃÂÃÂll start to see better credits appear, the approval rates will go up, but weÃÂÃÂve seen an enormous inbound.
But from an operational point of view, from a risk perspective, you know, skewing to the higher side of FICO bands, I think weÃÂÃÂre very, very pleased as is Apple with this sort of early month or two or three into this, and, you know, weÃÂÃÂll have more to say as we get further into the development of the portfolio itself.
Over time, I do think as you highlight there can be digital connectivity as we build a more digital two market platform, but thatÃÂÃÂs still something thatÃÂÃÂs often the future, and so we continue to focus on really penetrating a broader set of corporate clients where we have good relationships and access to their employee base.
I mean, I think much of the investing we are doing is consuming operating leverage that exist in the business, and the forward initiatives that David and I have talked about in terms of funding rationalization and expense reduction are all initiatives that need and must go on and they will continue to create operating leverage in the business, which will be put toward growth opportunities in the firm or shareholder return in the absence of them.
I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.
That said, global growth is not without risk as trade issues remain challenging.
While most CEOs remain focused on growing their businesses and capturing opportunities amid the disruptive forces of new technologies, geopolitical issues continue to give rise to some caution.
These include investments in our institutional client platform Marquee where we have seen strong growth to over 50,000 monthly active users and over 1 million API data requests every day.
Looking forward, as David noted, the ingredients for continued M&A activity remains solid.
Year-to-date, we ranked Number 1 globally in equity underwriting supported by nearly $50 billion of deal volume across more than 280 transactions.
Four of our five FICC businesses posted higher net revenues versus the prior year reflecting the continued strength of our client centric model and improved diversification of our business mix.
We also delivered solid performance in credit and mortgages where net revenues increased amidst improved activity from our broadening client base.
These results reflect our continued focus on improving the velocity of risk inventory supporting more efficient capital management in the business.
Lastly in currencies, net revenues declined driven by a more difficult geopolitical backdrop in emerging markets as volatility in Latin America and in particular Argentina offset strong performance in Europe.
For example, this quarter, we executed a number of sizable trades in U.S. investment-grade credit providing key financial and insurance clients access to our broad risk intermediation capabilities.
Equities client execution net revenues of $681 million were flat versus a year ago as stronger cash results offset lower derivative revenues.
Net revenues from commissions and fees were $728 million, up 8% versus a year ago aided by higher client activity.
Private equity net revenues of $929 million were driven by strong underlying corporate performance and events such as sales or additional capital raises.
Against that strength and performance, our private investment portfolio was also burdened by certain negative revaluations, including an approximately $80 million mark associated with our position in the [We] company.
Net revenues included record management and other fees of $1.5 billion, which were up 5% versus last year, reflecting continued growth in assets under supervision.
We also saw significantly lower incentive fees and modestly lower transaction revenues from our PWM client trading activity versus a year ago.
The ratios decreased by 20 basis points and 10 basis points respectively versus the second quarter, driven primarily by increased credit risk-weighted assets and roughly 10 basis point impact from our acquisition of United Capital.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
I know weÃÂÃÂve seen these things come and go before, but I just wanted to see if you could talk specifically towards those two big issues and just see if hopefully just overstating a short-term impact on the market?
Good morning and thanks for taking the questions.

goldmansachs,q4,2019,"David will start with brief highlights on our financial results, give an update on the broader operating environment, including developments related to 1MDB, and provide context for our upcoming Investor Day. Stephen will then discuss the recent enhancements we've made to our segment financial presentation, and cover fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results in detail.
On the revenue side, our Global Markets business produced stronger results in an environment that improved over the year, driven by strong leadership and a clear focus on client service.
While our operating expenses grew as a function of litigation and investments in our businesses, we actively controlled our costs across both compensation and non-compensation providing capacity to fund our growth.
We launched the firm's first ever credit card platform in partnership with Apple, and generated over $850 million in net revenues across our broader consumer banking business.
Lending related to our alternative investing businesses, including investments in debt securities and real estate credit is reflected in the Asset Management segment and lending to our individual clients across all wealth plans is in the Consumer & Wealth Management segment.
Additionally, we now report the firm's on balance sheet equity, credit, and real estate investing activities in our Asset Management segment.
To that end, this segment includes management and incentive fees associated with Asset Management clients across the full spectrum of asset classes from cash to alternatives, and will also include the impact of quarterly valuation changes, the balance sheet positions held in public and private equity investments.
Broadly speaking, and as I noted earlier, the new segments align with the client orientation of the firm Investment Banking, Global Markets and Asset Management encompass the firm's engagement with corporate, governments, and institutions, and Consumer &Wealth Management includes our engagement with individuals.
We also continue to see strength in our backlog coming into the New Year, notwithstanding solid revenue bookings from deal closings in the fourth quarter.
Net revenues were $599 million, up 14% versus the third quarter and up 37% from a year-ago, reflecting higher asset-backed and leverage finance activity.
These revenues relate to a net $28 billion funded portfolio of corporate loans now held in investment banking, as well as our portfolio of corporate lending commitments.
Moving to Global Markets on Page 5, net revenues were $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter up 33% versus last year.
Our growth was driven by a better market backdrop in FICC versus the end of last year, and strong performance in our equities businesses.
For the full-year, Global Markets generated $14.8 billion of net revenues, up 2% versus 2018 driven by stronger FICC and higher equity financing performance.
Four out of five of our FICC market making businesses posted higher fourth quarter net revenues versus the prior-year reflecting the continued strength of our client centric model, and improved diversification of our business mix, our environment effectively.
Collectively our Asset Management activities produced net revenues of $3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 52% versus last year, driven by stronger equity investment performance.
For the full-year, Asset Management generated net revenues of $9 billion in line with a strong 2018 as growth in equity investment revenues offset lower incentive fees.
Next our equity investments generated record quarterly net revenues in the fourth quarter of $1.9 billion, up significantly versus last year, driven by gains on our public and private investments.
On Page 8, turning to Consumer & Wealth Management, we produced $1.4 billion of revenues in the fourth quarter, up 8% versus a year-ago.
For the full-year, Consumer & Wealth Management generated net revenues of $5.2 billion, essentially unchanged versus a year-ago, as strong consumer banking growth and higher management and other fees offset lower incentive fees.
For the quarter, Wealth Management net revenues included record management and other fees of $967 million, up 17% versus last year, reflecting organic growth in the United Capital acquisition.
Consumer banking revenues were $228 million in the fourth quarter, up more than 20% versus last year, reflecting higher net interest income from strong growth in deposits and higher loan balances.
While still in early stages of growth, our consumer business generated a total of $864 million in revenues for the firm this year from a standing start just three-years ago.
For the full-year 2019, we reported NII of $4.4 billion, up 16% driven by deposit and loan growth in Consumer & Wealth Management, increased lending in Investment Banking, as well as more lending activity in Global Markets.
Our total operating expenses of $7.3 billion increased $2.1 billion versus the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting higher compensation and litigation expense in the quarter, as well as our continued investment for growth.
While investments in technology and new businesses, including specifically Marcus, Apple Card, Transaction Banking, and United Capital, added another 300 basis points.
For the full-year, the total pretax impact of our organic business projects, including Marcus, Apple Card, and Transaction Banking is approximately $700 million resulting in a drag of roughly 70 basis points on our ROE.
Now, turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the year at $993 billion, essentially unchanged versus the third-quarter and up 7% versus last year, driven by higher plan activity and areas of growth across the firm.
That initiative comprised a number of important efforts on which we continue to execute, including client expansion in investment banking, wallet share growth in global markets, consumer loan and deposit growth, lending and financing deployment and asset management growth.
As we go forward, we will continue to execute on these initiatives but our focus and communication will instead reflect more ambitious firmwide performance targets to be introduced on Investor Day. These targets will also reflect growth opportunities that were not included in the original $5 billion, such as transaction banking and credit cards.
In conclusion, our fourth quarter was strong, leading to full-year performance that was in line with the evolving macro environment and reflective of our continued investment in new businesses.
I think broadly speaking in lending, I would say mindful of the cycle; our clear plan is to grow financing revenues in both FICC and equities to answer your direct question.
But I think equally important Investor Day will be the beginning and not the end of a dialogue around this so that the numbers just don't stand alone and we give you context for rate of growth and how we're managing it.
About $100 million of that was found in the Consumer &Wealth management business and the vast majority of that was related to provisioning to the growth in Apple Card.
The balance of the $390 million call it $300 million or so related to impairments on loans across a variety of different segments, Asset Management being one, Investment Banking being the other, and that was around corporate wholesale credit, it involved impairments across a range of different industries, most notably in energy, some in manufacturing, none of which were material in the context of the firm.
In terms of your question on the height of investment, I have said and would reiterate here that 2019 is the depth of investment, when you look at investment across three of our discrete products, namely Marcus, Apple Card, and Transaction Banking, and equally I've made that reference and again, reiterate here excluding the reserve calculation which I obviously spoke of in the context of the prepared remarks.
Obviously, in the context of flat expenses year-over-year, our hope and expectation is that we'll start to see higher revenue generation from some of these investments, which will play out positively in the context of the efficiency ratio itself.
I was hoping you could speak to what inning youÃÂÃÂre in currently, just in terms of the platform build out and new investment for that strategy specifically and just through the cycle, how we could think about long-term pretax margin potential for that segment, as you continue to scale and maybe begin to run a bit closer to some of the peer comps?
I'd also say and I'll reflect on this here generally but more specifically in our Investor Day, our intent is not to leave you in the dark as to the Consumer & Wealth management segment in terms of overall margins, meaning, we want to give you a sense of where the wealth business sits that is the PWM business, which obviously demonstrates a much higher margin than what the segment reveals with the segment being in effect burdened by the continued growth in investment spend in the consumer space.
I would say a lot of that reflects continued growth in the Apple Card portfolio as well as lending more generally but again as you grow from a negligible level at the inception through to what we hold both in terms of roughly $1.9 billion of where we are and what that growth will be in the ensuing year.
But equally we obviously look at the totality of lending that's going on and the rate of growth as it relates to the overall balance sheet and the firm itself.
Yes, actually my question is related to that last one, which is looking at the Asset Management segment and the $22 billion of mainly private equity investments.
You also had a very strong fourth quarter for equity investment performance, which I would think I have a lower comp ratio to it.
I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr.
These conditions contributed to a supportive market making backdrop relative to a year-ago.
Secured or collateralized financing activity on behalf of institutional clients of our securities business is now reflected in FICC and equities financing within our Global Market segment.
This segment houses both GSEM and our merchant banking activities for Asset Management clients, supporting our third-party alternatives business expansion.
For the full-year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7.6 billion, our second highest ever down 7% from a record 2018 reflecting lower industry deal volumes.
Fourth quarter financial advisory revenues of $855 million were up 23% sequentially, but down 29% versus last year consistent with lower industry volumes.
For the year, we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting supported by $68 billion of deal volumes across more than 375 transactions.
In currencies, net revenues improved versus last year amidst a better geopolitical backdrop despite lower volatility.
Financing activity remains a strategic priority for the business, given it has historically exhibited attractive returns and considerable adjacent benefits to our broader equities franchise, particularly for our growing systematic client base.
Fourth quarter management and other fees related to client assets under supervision totaled $666 million, up 6% versus a year-ago offset by lower incentive fees.
Net revenues from lending activities in Asset Management were $427 million and primarily relate to loans backed by commercial and residential real estate.
Now let's turn to Page 9 for our firmwide assets under supervision.
And question two on that is how quickly can you expect those to a) grow and b) enhanced returns over the next year or two?
But when I look at sort of the NII disclosure on Page 10, it looks like only 15% of NII comes from Asset Management.
ThatÃÂÃÂs okay, thank you, helpful.
With respect to your second question, there were no material asset purchases that impacted global markets.
But just given expectations for a healthy step-up in provision, simply due to CECL implementation and some loan -- consumer loan seasoning, I was hoping you could maybe just help us frame a bit better, what's a reasonable provision level or run rate expectation if there's no change in the macro, but we simply have to reflect the impact of CECL with an assumption that you'll see relatively steady growth in consumer loans?
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
And then just one big picture question both David and you Stephen mentioned what functioning and constructive capital markets.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

goldmansachs,q1,2020,"For our part to help support corporate financing needs, we are proud that in recent weeks we have reopened markets and underwritten a record amount of U.S. dollar investment grade debt for clients.
We delivered solid growth in FICC and equities on high levels of client engagement as we extended balance sheet liquidity to clients during the most volatile markets in March.
In asset management, we saw direct impact from market dislocation as our on-balance sheet equity and debt investments experienced material mark-to-market losses from falling asset prices.
Turning to the operating environment on Page 3, the financial markets started the year on solid footing fueled by continued economic growth and strong consumer sentiment.
Given our strong financial position, we were able to commit our balance sheet on behalf of clients and support strong volumes across our global market franchise as investors sought to reduce risk exposure.
Looking forward, our economists expect a very significant near-term decline in growth followed by a rebound in the second half of the year when they expect us to get back about 50% of the decline in output that we lose in the first two quarters.
In our high net worth business, we completed our re-branding of United Capital, the Goldman SachsÃÂÃÂ personal financial management on schedule in March, and our strong growth in consumer deposits continues to underscore the strategic importance of that business.
During the first quarter, three of our four business segments produced revenue growth in excess of 20% versus the year ago period reflecting the strength of our franchise and the elevated level of activity in March.
These results were offset by losses in our asset management business due to the significant decline in the fair value of our long-term investments in equity, debt securities, and loans.
Despite the difficult backdrop, our overall revenue levels remained relatively flat versus a year ago, reflecting the diversification of our businesses.
Before turning specifically to our results, I want to reflect for a moment on the financial strength of the firm and the U.S. banking system coming into this period of volatility, in terms of capital, liquidity and risk.
During the time of increased market volatility and disruption, our ability to seamlessly serve our clients, while the vast majority of our employees work remotely demonstrates the dedication of our people, the strength of our engineering and our business resiliency in addition to the financial standing of the organization.
Given the new set of challenges facing a variety of industries, we expect client demand to evolve as they seek our assistance, bolstering balance sheets, hedging market and financial risks, and capturing strategic opportunities.
Our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our Number 4 global debt underwriting league table ranking and our ability to provide clients access to the investment grade and below investment grade markets, even through the challenging environment in March.
Of that, Goldman Sachs helped raise nearly $75 billion of financing for clients, capturing over 13% share, roughly double versus last year, evidencing our client engagement and commitment to market access.
Revenues from corporate lending were $442 million, nearly double the fourth quarter and up over three-fold versus a year ago, driven by approximately $375 million of hedge gains relating to our relationship lending book on wider credit spreads during the quarter.
Moving to Global Markets on Page 6, net revenues were $5.2 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially and up 28% versus last year.
Within FICC intermediation, we saw elevated client flows across all of our businesses, with four out of five business lines posting higher first quarter net revenues versus last year; again, reflecting the value of our standing commitment to a diversified FICC franchise.
In currencies, we saw a very active quarter with meaningful revenue improvement as higher volatility drove significantly higher client volume and strong performance in the Americas and Asia.
We continued to on-board new clients to our Marquee and eFX platforms during the quarter, and produced record results in this business, reflecting our significant investments in recent years, changing client workflows, and our willingness to provide liquidity during market stress.
Like in our currencies business, our technology platforms in credit enabled us to serve clients in period of market dislocation with both buyers and sellers benefiting from our global franchise, capital commitment, and the efficiency of our digital platforms.
Lastly in FICC financing, we saw a considerable strength in our repo business as we helped clients navigate dislocated funding markets, which have begun to normalize in recent weeks.
Moving to asset management on Page 8, collectively, our asset management activities produced negative net revenues of $96 million in the first quarter, first quarter management and other fees totaled $640 million, up 5% versus a year ago, driven by higher client assets under supervision.
Our equity investments produced $22 million of net losses in the first quarter as material gains generated on the pending or close sale of certain investments in January and February were more than offset by broader markdowns on our public and private equity holdings in March.
Gains from these dispositions were offset by approximately $500 million of marks on our private equity positions, reflecting the underlying operating performance of the businesses and roughly $500 million of marks on our $2 billion public equity portfolio including $180 million loss on Avantor and significantly smaller losses across the broader portfolio.
Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in Asset Management were a negative $868 million attributable to mark to market losses on debt securities and fair value loans.
That said, in the first quarter, the fair market value component of the portfolio managed by these teams incurred significant credit spread widening which more than offset the ongoing net interest income from the portfolio itself.
Turning to Consumer and Wealth Management on Page 10, we produced $1.5 billion of revenues in the first quarter, up 6% versus the fourth quarter and up 21% versus a year ago, driven by higher average assets under supervision, increased transaction volumes and incentive fees and higher consumer banking revenues from deposits and lending products.
For the quarter, wealth management and other fees of $959 million rose 21% versus last year, reflecting both organic growth and the United Capital acquisition.
Consumer banking revenues were $282 million in the first quarter, rising nearly 40% versus last year, reflecting higher net interest income from strong growth in deposits and credit card loan balances.
Going forward, we expect to see a more modest level of growth in both Marcus unsecured loans and Apple Card as we seek to manage our risk profile and reduce the pace of origination during this period of market and economic dislocation.
Total firm-wide net interest income was $1.3 billion for the first quarter, up 23% sequentially, reflected in global markets and consumer given the impact of lower funding costs and continued deposit growth.
In conclusion, our first quarter results reflected the volatile operating environment and our ability to navigate turbulent markets and support our client franchise.
In answering your question, I will point out what we did in this quarter, because I think it will reflect a process that we will continue to look at which is we weigh a variety of macroeconomic scenarios, one thatÃÂÃÂs optimistic, a base case and one thatÃÂÃÂs downside in a quarter in which we sat and if circumstances played we heavily weighted a downside scenario that doesnÃÂÃÂt rely exclusively on our economist, but takes a broad look.
And just to give you a little bit of insight into that, of that private portfolio, I would say 65% of it continued to perform well in the context of operating performance in the business, about 20% of that portfolio was impacted by COVID and was the source of a considerable number of the private marks taken and then 15% of portfolio was whatÃÂÃÂs on positive gains in the harvesting that was there.
In this quarter, you saw all people that operate the intermediation businesses benefit from higher volatility and more client activity.
And so I would just point out as an example in the context of the consumer book wherever committed to that business, but at this moment, in this environment we will be quite cautious in terms of credit extension and growing that book and will return to grow that book once this sort of circumstance and market volatility passes just as an example of how risk needs to be the governor in the context of managing this profile and the loan book overall.
And then just as a follow-up, results in trading and banking held up well and I realized itÃÂÃÂs impossible to predict or to have too much clarity, but can you help us out or provide some context or color on where you are continuing to see elevated activity versus the areas where we could expect some normalization or falloff just given some of the pockets that we have seen over the past 9 months?
And I think particularly in this market and most notably in March, this was a really good very stable source of funding for us, but I think the forward trajectory both as a strategy and then equally as it relates to our ability to harvest the kind of savings that we have talked about over the medium term is one that we are going to continue to adhere to and watch and achieve.
I guess first question here on just some of the puts and takes of the move in interest rates and obviously Goldman is going to be less levered to interest rate movements in some of the large banks, but just with the dramatic shift across the curve in the back half of the quarter, just if you can maybe help us think about some of the implications of the move on the model going forward whether it be on funding or revenues and then any other second derivatives, sounds like debt issuance might be one area of the benefits, but anything else we should be thinking about?
I will just come back to the commentary I made before, which is $19 billion of private equity positions, two-thirds of that portfolio in the context of our look and evaluation of their operating performance continued to perform well.
And I think the portfolio is obviously intended to hold up that well that way, but itÃÂÃÂs not immune by any means from broader macroeconomic circumstances and the marks will reflect the sort of assessment of performance as we move through uncertain quarters.
In addition, we launched a COVID-19 relief fund with $30 million commitment through Goldman Sachs Gives, including a special employee matching grant program to help healthcare workers, families and the most vulnerable populations.
Our business performed well in both January and February as markets notched new highs driven by client confidence in activity.
We also witnessed significant widening of credit spreads in both investment grade and high yield and de-risking from clients across all asset classes.
Helping clients access public market financing windows also enabled us to better risk manage our portfolio of acquisition finance commitments, as certain bridge in other facilities were taken out in permanent financings in the capital markets.
These deposit balances totaled $9 billion and weÃÂÃÂre now serving over 80 clients, reflecting the early diversification benefits of our new business growth strategy.
Growth was driven by significantly higher client activity amid wider bid-ask spreads and solid risk management in a challenging market.
Our rates franchise also performed well, given high levels of client intermediation and despite the challenge of managing risk positions through a significant jump in volatility as central banks around the world cut rates and the Fed and ECB launched significant quantitative easing programs.
We benefited from significantly higher client activity in more liquid index CDS products and notably in client portfolio trades, which more than offset the impact of wider credit spreads amid lower liquidity in cash product trading inventory.
Equities intermediation net revenues of $1.5 billion rose 32% versus a year ago aided by derivatives given higher equity market volatility and significantly higher client volumes.
This portfolio includes a range of investing activities executed by our private credit group and multi-strategy investing teams, which have historically generated solid contributions to firm performance over many years.
Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $128 billion, up $19 billion sequentially driven primarily by funded commercial revolvers in investment banking as I noted earlier.
In our consumer portfolio, provisions related to markets were higher versus last quarter due primarily to CECL reserve rates even though realized net charge-offs declined.
Additionally, we note out provisions during the quarter were impacted by higher levels of reserving for new loan growth under CECL which we adopted as planned.
Our total quarterly operating expenses of $6.5 billion increased 10% versus last year driven by significantly higher brokerage clearing and exchange fees attributable to higher client activity.
[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
I am just looking forward how are you thinking about loan growth both in terms of customer demand and your risk appetite to lend into global recession?
Good morning and thanks for taking the questions.
We have seen a lot of your competitors aggressively match the Fed rate cuts, but you maintained very competitive deposit payouts, certainly help contribute to strong deposit growth this quarter.
Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
I am sorry I wanted to circle back on the provision assumptions, I know you have spoken about it a couple of times, but itÃÂÃÂs just so little confusing to me because I am not ÃÂÃÂ you have referenced sort of what the Goldman Sachs economists think, but it seemed as though you suggested thatÃÂÃÂs not what was necessarily an input into your own provision assumptions?
Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Your next question is from the line of Jeremy Sigee with Exane BNP Paribas.
I just wondered if you could talk more about what your expectations are for total balance sheet assets expanding further in the next couple of quarters and also risk weighted assets.
