morganstanley,q2,2015,"Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
As recent market volatility, particularly driven by events in Greece and China has demonstrated, the near-term landscape can change quickly.
Notable transactions in the quarter include an advisory; Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor to Time Warner Cable on the announced acquisition by Charter Communications valued at $79 billion.
In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley as lead left book runner priced FitbitÂs $841 million IPO.
This transaction highlights Morgan Stanley's continued leadership in transformative technology IPOs. In fixed income underwriting, we acted as lead left book runner on AbbVieÂs sixth tranche $16.7 billion debt offering to finance its previously announced acquisition.
Underwriting revenues were strong at $1 billion driven by a pickup in primary equity issuance and an industry record for quarterly new issue volumes for U.S. investment grade debt, which was aided by an uptick in M&A related financing.
The pipelines are healthy and while the third quarter historically maybe seasonally lighter for capital markets; we think longer-term positive trends remain intact.
Equity sales and trading had another excellent quarter with $2.3 billion of revenue, driven by high levels of client activity across all products.
Other revenues were up versus last quarter driven primarily by fees and marks on our lending and event book.
Lastly, average trading bar for the second quarter was $54 million, up slightly driven by increased client activity and choppier markets.
Asset management revenues were up 3% from last quarter driven by higher fee-based client balances from positive flows.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
James noted the two notch upgrade may help in FIC.
We did benefit from activity levels being higher in China this quarter.
Okay, great.
So we hear some commentary about potential for FIC share gains obviously there was some press a few weeks ago about whether or not there was a strategic change.
That doesnÂt mean we are not going to be more efficient providers and it doesnÂt mean that we wonÂt pick up share and that does mean that as these markets continue to grow relatively low volumes there wonÂt be more opportunity for us on the revenue side.
A $1 billion increase in whatÂs allocated to Wealth Management whether we look at average common equity or common equity Tier 1 linked quarter, whatÂs driving that?
ThatÂs obviously critically important because as you remember from our January presentation where we laid out some illustrative asset yields you saw that our lending products were generating 150 to 250 basis points more of yield than our AFS or cash or short-term investments.
Well, Mike firstly I admire your consistency in coming back to this question every quarter and thatÂs obviously something which remains a focus for us.
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
But right now in terms of our deposit balances we have excess deposits that we can deploy without requiring deposit balance but weÂre going to continue to try to penetrate our client base and grow those deposits with some new products going forward.
Our fixed strategy remains unchanged and we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reshape fixed-income and commodities into a more focused business.
Finally, in Investment Management, we delivered a strong quarter that benefited particularly from investment gains in merchant banking and real estate investing.
The efficiency ratio was 72% in the second quarter and we remain very focused on expense management both in terms of comp and non-comp expenses.
We continue to be disciplined on risk weighted assets in end of the quarter at a $157 billion of FIC RWAs. A meaningful portion of this decline was driven by a reduction in risk as client activity decreased, while Greece dominated the headlines in the middle of June, as well as our continued passive roll off.
During the quarter, consistent with our strategy of exiting physical oil, we also announced the sale of our global oil merchanting business and expect that to close later this year.
Our view remains positive as recovery further plays out in the U.S. We see steady performance in our business with growth coming from our bank strategy and fee-based programs.
Consistent with the execution of our U.S. bank strategy, net interest revenue increased 7% to $737 million, driven by growth in lending and realization of the forward curve in our Investment Securities portfolio.
Wealth Management lending balances grew $4 billion or 10% from the prior quarter.
In Investment Management, revenues were up 12% sequentially driven by gains in the real estate and merchant banking business and total AUM ended the quarter at $403 billion.
And I know itÂs always hard to answer, but between Asian equities so strong and second half usual seasonality in FIC and the big results in merchant banking and real estate, IÂm just looking for any guidance on how much of that we should expect moderating in the second half, just on seasonality?
I think as you said, Glenn, the business was much more balanced in the first half across all of our businesses and all of our products, in all our -- all of our geographies in terms of seasonality.
Yes, I think as you point out in merchant banking and our real estate business, we did see good principal gains in the quarter.
Maybe can you help us understand how much of a tailwind that was and then also given some of the volatility we have seen since the end of the second quarter, how are clients reacting to that and what is your expectation for continued strength in the region?
First I will comment our Asia-Pacific results and business, we are strong across all our businesses, equities, fixed income, and investment banking this quarter.
I would say that was more broadly dominated with some macro headlines towards the end of the year, not just in China, so we did see as we said risk positions come down and client engagement slow down a little bit in the back half of June and early parts of July.
We are clearly focused on improving the ROE in that business and we think weÂve made real progress here in the first half.
And as others have observed in the global FIC investment banking sales trading marketplace, there is clearly more turmoil in other parts of world than there is in the U.S. and we think that there is potential for over a period of time for share gain for our business.
We are more focused on how weÂre moving this business over a four or five year period and obviously the more recent result suggest itÂs moving in the right direction.
So I think in our Wealth Management business the drivers are still pretty consistent with what weÂve seen in prior quarters both in terms of the fee-based businesses as well as the deposit deployment and the improvement in NII.
In terms of our deposit deployment strategy and our excess liquidity in our banks, we still think that has room to play out and that will be a continuation and the primary driver of our NII growth going forward.
We saw $4 billion of loan lending balances increases in the Wealth Management business this quarter.
We saw lending balances increase about $6 billion in totality, so we had about $2 billion of growth from our Institutional Securities client and we see that trends continuing as well.
So again, a nice steady quarter in Wealth Management and weÂd expect those trends to continue.
At the same time IÂm looking at capital balances in institutional and they are down about a couple billion dollars this quarter.
And thirdly what is true is that we have been through that process over the last several years and feel like we have a business right sized where the risk weighted assets have come down from I donÂt know, Guy, about four years ago there were 390 billion I think in FIC and there we just reported somewhere close in the 160s.
Is that as simple as what you talked about in the opening remarks, that the balance sheet was smaller at the end of the quarter and it was going to kind of bounce around that way, or is there something more strategic going on with respect to for example, run-off of some of those legacy positions that you were talking about thatÂs driving down that FIC RWA, that's driving the -- almost $2 billion reduction in capital NIS?
I know you addressed it a little bit at your conference a few weeks ago, but maybe you can talk a little bit about the decline in interest rate sensitivity that was evident in your Q, the degree to which that might have reflected just a difference in asset deployment strategy, securities versus loans, whatever and whether there are any risk management elements that we need to think about with respect to the change there?
First would just be our overall interest rate position and how we think about NII, and then the second part of the question really around the disclosures.
And then lastly just on our overall interest rate positioning, our NII growth and results are in line and consistent with where we were in the beginning of the year in terms of our views.
The second comment about that disclosure is you know itÂs a 12 month disclosure and weÂre clearly focused on a longer term view when we think about our balance sheet and our interest rate positioning.
WeÂre obviously focused on the overall PBT in that margin -- PBT in that business which came in at 23%, which is we said before was up nicely and we continue to hopefully make progress in that going into the future quarters.
So, couple of questions on the longer term prospects of the Wealth Management business.
Firstly the reduction in the comp ratio is overwhelmingly driven by the business mix as in non-compensable for revenues and by the cost structure, non-compensation expenses that we've realized some benefits and scale coming out of the integration a couple of years ago of the Smith Barney deal.
One, we've got a stated target of $180 billion of FIC RWA in that business, weÂre going to clearly operate within that target.
CCAR continues to evolve quarter -- year-over-year, and we're going to continue to do our best to manage our capital ratio so we can return capital to our shareholders as well as continue to grow our business.
So just, when you think about going forward, in a positive revenue environment, I just wanted to get an update on some of the targets that you had for like the comp ratios by segment and probably more importantly on the non-comp side, because that's been fairly well managed, thereÂs obviously been some volatility around legal in the past.
And I think we feel good about the growth rates that weÂve seen and our ability to penetrate our client base.
As I mentioned, we had about $2 billion of growth in the Institutional Securities balances this quarter.

morganstanley,q3,2015,"Please see our SEC filings including this quarterÂs earnings release and financial supplement at www.morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley.
Our wealth management franchise was impacted by a lack of new issue product and a general retail investor step back from markets, given volatility.
Besides the normal summer seasonality, the quarter was characterized by global equity markets trending lower, volatility metrics increasing, spreads widening, policy uncertainty and periodic bouts of risk aversion.
Equity underwriting revenues were $250 million, down 49% versus second quarter, primarily reflecting declines across all products, particularly for IPOs and follow-ons.
Fixed income underwriting revenues were down 29% versus the second quarter driven by decreases in both investment grade and non-investment grade loan and bond underwriting.
Notable underwriting transactions in the quarter includes in equity, Morgan Stanley acted as joint underwriter and joint lead manager on a $3.6 billion rights offering for Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
Coming off of two strong quarters, equity sales and trading again was solid, against a backdrop of significantly more volatility.
Prime brokerage revenues remained solid, although down from a very strong second quarter, which is seasonally high related to European dividend activities.
FX results were up modestly versus second quarter as increased volatility led to continued client engagement.
Asset management revenues were flat from last quarter with higher revenues from fee-based accounts, partially offset by lower mutual fund activity.
Global fee-based asset inflows were $7.7 billion in the quarter, continuing the trend we see toward client demand for managed accounts.
Transactional revenues were also impacted by subdued levels of retail investor activity, driven by ongoing uncertainty and global volatility.
And securities-based lending remains highly over collateralized and continued to perform well despite the quarter's volatility.
Total assets under management ended the quarter at approximately $404 billion.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
We think bringing it together with equities and having one sales and trading business is the most efficient and effective way to serve our clients and we'll come back over time with whatever changes that might imply.
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC.
Your final question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.
First, and obviously fixed income underperformed in the quarter, largely due to a very challenging market environment, in which we were significantly impacted given our business mix, particularly our focus on credit and rates.
Second, most of the investment management business performed solidly, but the aggregate results significantly underperformed.
Notwithstanding the challenges of the quarter, our core long-term strategy remains in place, namely, a balanced business model in which the consistency of wealth management offsets potential volatility in institutional securities.
Compensation expense was $3.4 billion, down 22% versus $4.4 billion last quarter, driven by lower revenues.
We saw underperformance in fixed income, driven by relative mix of our business, primarily by lower revenue in credit and securitized products in a challenging credit market, in addition to lower activity and rates given investor uncertainty on said action.
Equity sales and trading revenues were strong, as clients remained engaged across regions and products, and in advisory, we had our best quarter in several years, as M&A volumes remain strong.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 15%, driven primarily by increased litigation reserve, I mentioned previously.
In investment banking, we saw strong performance in our M&A business offset by weakness in the debt and equity underwriting markets, resulting in investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion, down 18% sequentially.
The business remained number one in the US, and we believe we continue to be number one globally, driven by our focus on clients and execution, which has led us to our leadership position.
Ex-DVA, revenues of $1.8 billion in the quarter were down 22% sequentially, but essentially flat year-over-year, as clients remained active and engaged.
Cash equity revenues were down versus the second quarter and year-over-year, driven by a more challenging environment, including a lighter primary calendar and periods of risk aversion.
Derivative revenues were down quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower corporate derivative activity, but remained strong and were up year-over-year.
For the quarter, fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenue were $583 million, excluding DVA, down 54% versus the second quarter.
Rates revenues in the quarter were down sequentially, driven by significant policy uncertainty, that led to sporadic client activity and engagement.
Investment revenues were up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by gains on business-related investments.
Over the past few years, our daily revenues are a good indication of the stability and consistency of our wealth management business and they have consistently been between $50 million and $70 million, with no day year-to-date below this range.
Net interest income revenue increased 2% quarter-over-quarter, driven by steady, prudent growth in lending, consistent with the continued execution of our US bank strategy.
Funded lending balances in wealth management grew approximately $3 billion during the quarter and $12 billion year-over-year.
Deposits in our bank deposit program were $139 billion, up $7 billion versus the second quarter, as clients moved into cash and a volatile market.
Wealth management representatives were up slightly versus the second quarter on lower attrition.
In investment management, the quarter was difficult, for Asia valuations in particular in China and monetization events, which resulted in revenues of $274 million, down 64% sequentially.
The vast majority of the sequential declines in revenue could be attributed to the reversal of previously-accrued carried interest in our Asia private equity business and no material gains in our other funds versus last quarter.
This quarter however, we had to reverse more than two-thirds of the carry that our Asia private equity funds had accrued.
I think in terms of our equities performance, as we said, we continued to maintain our leadership position and we are number one.
And then lastly, I think on the repricing question, I would answer by saying that we've been focused on the returns to the prime brokerage business, and we've done that in partnership with our clients and looking at the relationship holistically across the nine boxes that we've discussed before.
We've done this through a combination of better business mix, optimization and wider pricing, and we've seen the revenue per balance sheet usage increase over the last year.
I'll just add a couple of things to what Jon said, Guy. Firstly, if you look at the performance of fixed this year, you've seen three very different quarters.
I think combining the fixed income business with equities under the leadership of Mr. And we continue to watch this space very carefully.
We're by no means complacent about this, and but at the same time, there are elements of our fixed income business which are essential to everything else that we do in investment banking with our wealth management and so on.
We'll give him a little time to get his arms around the business with the management team there, which they will do, and I'm sure in the New Year, we'll be saying a lot more about it.
It is obviously a significantly smaller business for us than equities or wealth management.
What I would say, Mike, is if you look at that line in our supplement there in terms of the investment, it was negative $235 million this quarter versus a positive $232 million in the second quarter.
The two drivers of that is one, virtually all of that negative number can be attributed to the reversal of carry from our Asia PE business, and two, in the second quarter, we saw significant monetization events across the entire fund complex and we didn't see any material monetization events in this quarter.
We delivered 23% margin on lower revenues in wealth management, which is exactly what we said we would do in strategy.
Jonathan, just on the wealth management business, if we look at the transaction revenues not just for the quarter, but even year-to-date, looks like they've been weaker.
But really want to understand the mix of that business, because when we're in more volatile environments, we can see some quarters where some weird things happen.
For the full year, right, there is an adjustment period as the geographic mix, there is the actual mix of earnings based on legal entity versus a managed business, as well as sort of a look forward of what we think that mix is going to look like.
But as Â sort of has been alluded to, equities and wealth management has seemed to have gone well and this is the one business that has continued to draw attention.
Listen, I think we've said what we've wanted to say about this quarter.
One was on the wealth management net interest income, where in the previous couple of quarters, certainly Q2 you mentioned the realization of the forward curve and your investment securities proposal has been a factor.
",46.51,0.88490695
morganstanley,q4,2015,"While weÂve been reshaping fixed for several years, the volatile and shrinking revenue pool coupled with the steady increase in capital requirements led us to take further significant action at year end.
We believe our robust equity base coupled with a derisk balance sheet and a transformed business mix, provides a strong foundation to support our current plan.
Notwithstanding considerable efforts to reduce the capital required to support FIC, further regulatory changes in recent years and a prolonged difficult environment led us to believe that much more radical actions were necessary.
Even closer integration with equities and banking within Institutional Securities, and in partnership with Wealth Management against our core client base, will allow us to enhance asset velocity and ultimately optimize wallet.
In addition to our focus on compensation discipline, we have launched a major company-wide initiative called Project Streamline, an effort lead by our CFO Jon Pruzan, and COO Jim Rosenthal, which is designed to identify and implement significant infrastructure expense reductions by the end of 2017.
Now letÂs turn to Wealth Management on Slide 15.
We continue to see strong high quality loan demand on our Wealth Management client base.
A highly scalable business like Wealth Management enables us to add sources of revenue with lower compensation payouts such as net interest growth.
The challenging fixed income markets against which weÂve carried outsized capital levels.
We continued to see pressure from volatility in fixed income underwriting volumes and revenues were $346 million, down 7% versus the third quarter, driven by decreases in loan fees partially offset by investment grade bond fees.
Fixed income and commodity sales and trading continue to under-perform in a difficult environment, characterized by spread widening in various products and lower levels of client activity.
Deposits in our bank deposit program were $149 billion at year-end up $10 billion versus the third quarter reflecting normal seasonality in deposits as well as clientÂs moving to cash in a volatile market.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
But weÂre setting ourselves up for increasing returns over the next several years at the same time letÂs make investments across the rest of the business.
Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
Last quarter we saw that kind of negative accrual I think on the Asia private equity your Merchant Banking fund [ph], just what type of exposure unit in the investment management business have Â those types of products so we can see those swings.
And then in wealth management I feel like the transaction revenues have been pretty weak for a while and thatÂs more of an industry trend but just wanted to figure out are we stabilizing here, meaning are there pressures there somewhat coming to a slowdown?
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Good morning, thanks for taking my question.
Good morning, thanks for taking my question.
But I guess IÂm curious how youÂre thinking about what appears to be a greater level of regulatory scrutiny both in areas like leverage lending, but also in commercial real estate which seem Â which where youÂve grown quite visibly over the last two years to three years as youÂve pushed on your bank growth program.
Okay, thanks for taking my questions.
Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
So on the other hand, investment banking has been operating at a high level as you highlighted, a choppy market could impact those businesses.
And then just within the Wealth Management comp target that improvement to less than 56%, is that and entirely driven by leverage off of higher margin revenues like NII or are there other core comp expense reductions that they can occur within GWN, the GWN that we should be thinking about?
Your final question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC.
We acted on those things within our control by initiating a major restructuring affect, conducting a large reduction in force in December, reducing our compensation-to-revenue ratio, launching a large scale firm-wide expense initiative, more on that later, significantly reducing RWAs impact to $136 billion, well below our target of $180 billion, and closing the sale of our oil merchanting business.
In our Institutional Securities business, we have maintained our leadership positions in Investment Banking and equity sales and trading, as illustrated on Slide 4.
In banking, we continue to see strength and finished second in global announced M&A and number one in IPOs. Slide 5 recaps what we laid out last year and our results.
In Wealth Management, we achieved a full-year profit margin of 22%, with pre-tax earnings of $3.3 billion, a record for this business.
We maintained our focus on expense management and achieved a full-year ISG compensation ratio ex-DVA of 37%, below our stated goal of 39% or less.
These include capital sufficiency, expense efficiency, Wealth Management revenue growth and capital returns to shareholders.
Given the cyclical, and in some cases structural challenges facing fixed income, driven by the work Colm and Ted did at the end of last year, we took the decision to downside headcount by 25%, along with our ongoing balance sheet and capital focus.
As such we have set a net target ratio of 74% in 2017, which translates into $1 billion in expense reductions over the next two years.
To be clear, we do not expect the revenue environment to apply, especially given ongoing growth initiatives like Lending and Wealth Management; however, we believe this assumption is appropriately conservative.
In a volatile environment, we benefited from the strength of our equities, investment banking and wealth management businesses.
In a challenging environment for some of our institutional security business, overall revenues ex-DVA were $3.5 billion, up 2% quarter-on-quarter.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 13% driven by lower litigation costs.
Turning to underwriting, equity underwriting revenues were $352 million up 41% versus the third quarter, primarily reflecting increases in IPOs. The fourth quarter was a continuation of the strength we have seen all year in equity sales and trading as clients remained active and we delivered across products and regions in a volatile market.
Given the sale of our two large physical oil businesses, we would expect to see less seasonality in our first quarter FIC results going forward.
In our wealth management business, we continue to see steadiness, for the quarter and for the full-year 2015, we saw average revenues per day of approximately $60 million with no day below $50 million.
Revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion, excluding the impact of differed compensation plan investments in both periods revenues were approximately flat sequentially.
Let me start by saying first, weÂve laid out RWA targets, so there Â for I think the last three years and going back I still remember a number like $392 billion or there about in around the third quarter of 2011 in FIC.
I guess is there any way that we could think about revenue or you could maybe help us to frame how to think about revenue, because obviously if you are going to take that much capital out, right.
You talked about focusing on some of the strengths a few business lines maybe you could help us think about which businesses you are going to be deemphasizing and how much revenue you think realistically could come out as a result of that.
I think the basic position we are in was we had more balance sheet and more capital in the business than we were generating revenues on.
So we donÂt think thereÂs going to be great revenue diminution from this point given where we finished 2015, which frankly as we said we are very candid that was disappointing.
Yes, the one thing I would add is just to give you a better sense of some of the things we are getting out of as James mentioned, most of that is not in the U.S. Things like sovereign CDS, some of the non-core European currencies, Asia distressed trading, some of the bespoke [ph] correlation products as well as all of the work weÂve done on our commodities business in terms of the oil merchanting businesses as well as the announcement regarding our European power and gas last year.
Obviously, itÂs with the appropriate caveat which you would expect if we have a major outsized litigation expense or penalties that are unforeseen if the markets completely collapse here if we have no revenue growth, if the Fed responded very differently to our capital plans than what we intended it gets harder.
We were happy to see the litigation expense go down in the fourth quarter, but in terms of breaking out those individual numbers, we have historically not done that but again itÂs Â it does require no major single individual event.
In terms of the Â what I would say is the slide in the deck is only in the wealth management segment so itÂs not a total lends on the bank.
WeÂll be coming back to you with more detail throughout the year but in terms of the 2016 number that loan growth that you see out of wealth management would be consistent with those targets.
And if we think about a backdrop where thereÂs 4% annual revenue growth, a 74% efficiency ratio, 32% tax rate, and flat preferreds and non-controlling interest, it gets to you about $6 billion of net income to common and if I even take just the low end of that 9% to 11% ROE range, the implied common equity is about $66 billion which suggests payouts in excess of 100% over the next two years.
So as we laid out on the page, first of all the compensation, the billion dollars plus of compensation and non-comp savings are assuming a flat revenue environment so if we get out two years and weÂre flat to today our ratio will be 74%.
As James mentioned we do expect revenue growth throughout this period and therefore the efficiency ratio should be lower than the 74% because we do have operating leverage in the business.
And Jonathan, I think you spend a lot of time talking about capital and obviously itÂs going to be contingent on the feedback you get from regulators and presumably they would be inclined or incentivized to reward actions to reduce your systemic risk footprint or exposure system with more risk intensive activities, based on your discussions have you been given any indication that they would be perceptive to higher payouts for those that are willing to shrink more aggressively in those areas.
No, I donÂt think thatÂs possible but do I believe that weÂre going to be in a position where we increase our returns, absolutely.
WeÂre doing it because we think these businesses should be run with returns at or above 10% and nobody in this world predicted the last four or five years of whatÂs gone in the markets and the amount of capital that would be required to support these businesses when I took this job our capital base was $40 billion, today itÂs $69 billion.
We believe there is revenue growth across many parts of our business over a two year period and we believe we are sufficiently capitalized given the world that we operate in so if you add all those pieces together putting it in terms of a target to help investors have a framework rather than open ended seem to be the right transition point for Morgan Stanley.
James, just on the FIC side of the business, post restructuring, I know itÂs tough to gauge but when you mentioned and you look at the revenue environment and kind of where your run rate now, you wouldnÂt expect much of a drop-off.
No, I think of that in terms of the full year, obviously the second half but our revenue run rates of $500 million were incredibly low.
But we look what the total market size is what our share is, and what our expected share is, and expected market size in the next couple of years and thatÂs why we say we believe weÂre right-sized for revenue rate equivalent to 2015.
This quarter it was $100 million that return to a positive number was driven by all of our Â most of our investing businesses both private equity infrastructure and real estate that was more balanced.
Before getting that page in front of me, I think the results this quarter, we did see Asia was down, but it continues to be a strong and important part of our business.
Just this minute, but that you should also know is managed, the way we look at the business is on a managed basis, and so those revenues donÂt necessarily tied back to the tax rate that I talked about earlier regarding the geographic mix of earnings.
Okay, thank you, and then a little closer to home, how are you thinking, it seems that youÂre assuming that lending both in the corporate side of things, as well as Within Wealth Management is going to continue at what appears to be roughly similar growth rate as you saw this year.
So, Matt, IÂm not sure, I wouldnÂt agree with that statement, I think historically over the last couple of years, weÂve seen good growth in both the ISG lending product as well as the Wealth Management lending product and those have been the key drivers along with deploying our deposits away from securities into these loans.
When we think about the 3% to 5% revenue growth with ROE target, yes, some items like NII should increase without the backdrop changing and hopefully will be above that.
",46.34,0.72917074
morganstanley,q1,2016,"The securities businesses were exposed to a number of these factors, which led to a more challenging revenue environment than what we have come to expect in the first quarter of the year.
The S&P level at the end of the first quarter will help with asset pricing in our Wealth Management business, where we continue to grow our lending book and see flows into managed accounts.
As part of Streamline, we are reshaping our expense base, and have embarked on an aggressive evaluation of our global infrastructure costs, reviewing each product, business and geography globally to convince ourselves that we need our footprint as it is currently configured.
As James said, the beginning of 2016 got off to a challenging start as negative sentiment and volatility prevailed in the global markets, undermining the traditional strength and client activity we have typically seen at the start of the year.
Advisory revenues for the quarter were the strongest post-crisis at $591 million, up 15% as the deals announced last year continue to close.
Prime brokerage revenues were higher this quarter as we work closely with our clients and continue to focus on the efficiency of our balance sheet and returns.
As a reminder, 40% of our approximately $15 billion funded and unfunded energy exposure is fair value or held for sale, where we mark-to-market daily and have taken markdowns this quarter.
The first quarter for commission revenues were the lowest we have seen in the last five years, reflecting the very cautious attitude of investors in this highly uncertain environment.
Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $526 million, up 5% versus 4Q, reflecting the steadiness of this revenue line, and AUM was essentially unchanged at $405 billion.
Investment revenues in the quarter were a loss of $64 million, driven by volatility and particular weakness in emerging market investments, resulting in mark-downs and some reversal of carry.
Lastly, in the quarter, as you will see in our supplement, we modified our segment common equity allocation disclosure to base it on fully phased in regulatory capital, as the market has focused more on these ratios than the transitional ratios.
Turning to the outlook, across sales and trading, we do not believe that the backdrop we saw in the first quarter will become a permanent state and have already seen some improvement in market conditions.
In Wealth Management, we would expect to see the stability and trends seen in the last several quarters to continue.
So when we think about those targets in that revenue range of up low-single digits to down 20%, how much of the cost structure can be managed, particularly, if we're not Â obviously, not down 20%, but even if we're plus or minus 5% on the revenue base, is that still an environment where, by the end of 2017, the targets are still attainable?
I think it's Â I know we're going to get a lot of calls on this, because that's the perils of putting out a target is you get asked about it every time, every quarter until you finally get there.
We're going to work with our clients to provide solution to their investment needs, and I think, by the end of the day, overall impact to both our clients and our financial results are very manageable.
We've got about $800 billion in managed accounts now, about 40% of our assets, and we think we can continue to grow that.
And then, with respect to trading, particularly in FIC, it sounds like the quarter ended on a better note, so can you just maybe help us think about that as it carry into April and is it Â across businesses and really within credit specifically, it seems like that was one area that was a little bit of a headwind, so how are markets there and how's activity started this quarter?
We did see a pickup towards the end of March that sort of followed through a little bit here in the first couple of weeks of April, although, obviously, the events over the weekend and what we've seen in Asia and some of the commodities is just a stark reminder that we're going to continue to see periods of volatility here.
Obviously, a lot of moving pieces with a weak macro, restructuring that you're doing, but as you think about kind of more of a steady state or a typical first quarter, and I can appreciate it's very hard to frame, but are you thinking leverage of kind of 50% higher from where we are here or how are you right-sizing the cost base?
Since also the first quarter of last year, we continue to restructure and reshape this business both in terms of its footprint and capital intensity.
In the first quarter or at the end of last year, we had about $190 billion of RWA dedicated to the business and, today, that number is closer to $130 billion.
We were going to try to maintain the revenue footprint and, therefore, it was obviously going to improve the overall profitability of the business.
I guess my question on the back of that though is there any change to the expectation that FIC, as a result of the strategic actions that you took late last year, that it could free up more than $5 billion to $8 billion in capital over time?
Listen, I think that the plan that we laid out in January in terms of the actions around the balance sheet and SLR footprint leads to about $5 billion to $8 billion of freed-up capital.
We said in the past that we might reinvest some of that back into other ISG businesses, so that line item might not move as people would expect, but, again, we're going to evaluate all of our businesses and all of our assets and investments to see if we can be more capital efficient.
Maybe a follow-up on that is as the fixed income business continues to evolve, it would seem that it is going to evolve to be more of a digital market business with probably less of a human, but also probably over time still less of an economic capital footprint associated with it.
The speed in which that happens is obviously going to be determined over time, and we do think we are well-positioned given our leadership that we've shown in digital and electronic products in the past.
So, I think we're going to continue to manage it tightly.
I think the fact that we no longer have the physical oil business should reduce the seasonality that we saw in this business, clearly, but also many of the changes that we've made are going to try to hopefully improve the consistency of this business.
This quarter is a decent starting point, because we didn't have the physical oil business in it, but we obviously had a difficult macro backdrop.
We need to get the ROE of this business up, and one of the ways we're going to do that is being much more efficient in our expense management.
But I think the real growth in NII for us within the Wealth Management business is going to come from the fact that we expect the average earning assets to grow probably by Â in the bank to grow probably by $10 billion to $15 billion this year.
Hi, the new CEO letter talks about progress with the business mix, banking equities and other areas, but the ROE, as you pointed out, was only 6% in the first quarter.
But, as I said, and they weren't caveats, they were just reality, they implied that we hit our expense targets on a flat revenue environment, that our total revenues grew somewhere between 3% and 5%, and that we did the right thing around right-sizing our fixed income business and freeing up the right capital.
So, listen, we're making steady progress, we're committed to our goals, we'll continue pushing on expenses, we'll do what we can to free up excess capital, and we believe the environment is likely to improve from where we saw the bottoms of the first quarter.
So in the first quarter of 2015, you saw the 19% Wealth Management ratio, I think the better comparison, the change in any capital allocation, if you look at the middle two columns, the business went from 14% to 12%.
Again, the ROE targets are for the firm Â for all of our capital and, as we've mentioned in the past, we are clearly trying to drive improved profitability in that business by maintaining the revenues, reducing the capital and reducing the costs.
We laid out a plan just this past January that said we were going to try to maintain the revenue footprint that we've seen in the past, reduce the capital intensity and reduce the costs.
Just trying to understand better how we should think about the run rate of the cost line with this Streamline Project coming on.

Good morning, this is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
Markets were challenging, equity issuance was effectively non-existent, and retail activity was extremely subdued, reflecting the many uncertainties with which investors grappled.
These included negative interest rates internationally, questions around the pace of Fed activity in the U.S., the growth rate of the Chinese economy, and growing concerns about geopolitical issues like the migration crisis and potential for Brexit, among others.
M&A was robust, equities once again delivered a strong performance, and Wealth Management generated a pre-tax margin greater than 21% despite market headwinds and fewer trading days.
We made real progress in our expense discipline ahead of our broader initiative called Project Streamline, which, as we said, will play out over the next two years.
In order to drive capital returns to shareholders on a more substantial base than our current CCAR submission is asking for, we must continue to reduce those parts of our business that give rise to the high stress losses and capital deductions and/or balance sheet usage.
During the first quarter, we early adopted the accounting guidance that requires that DVA be presented in accumulated other comprehensive income as opposed to net revenues.
We are building the next-generation Wealth Management desktop and mobile suite for both our financial advisors and clients, while optimizing and automating our operations and work flow.
In particular, there are opportunities across our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management businesses where we have the ability to drive efficiencies while improving collaboration.
Equity underwriting revenues were $160 million, down 55% versus 4Q, driven largely by the significant decreases in IPOs. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $239 million, down 31% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting a slowdown in high-yield and leveraged loan markets.
This translated into ongoing muted levels of client activity across our Fixed Income & Commodities business.
Other revenues were down versus fourth quarter, driven by an increase in our allowance for loan losses for our held for investment portfolio.
Our loan-loss provision on our HFI portfolio of $127 million this quarter was predominantly against our energy portfolio.
Wealth Management revenues for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, down 2% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting muted client activity in an unfavorable market environment as well as fewer trading days.
Funded lending balances in Wealth Management grew approximately $2 billion or 5% during the quarter and $12 billion or 30% year-over-year.
Non-compensation expenses were down 5% versus fourth quarter, driven by seasonally lower expenses in marketing and business development.
The increase reflects a low fourth quarter spot asset level given lower client activity at the end of the year as well as higher levels of liquidity in the first quarter.
Pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $386 billion, down from $395 billion in the fourth quarter.
So making sure we have good products and services across that full spectrum is going to be important and I think the recent hire that we made on our digital strategy to lead that in Wealth Management is really going to yield some interesting innovations going forward.
Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.
Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. I think there's still quite a bit of benefit to come from your initiatives there.
Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thank you very much.
And could you talk about your vision for fixed income now that Ted has been overseeing it for a long enough time to maybe start to think about how it becomes more digital?
And then, thinking about the loan book here, you all saw NII grow faster than loans here this quarter in Wealth Management.
Yeah, sorry.
You had 5% annualized buybacks this quarter, which is decent, but you also mentioned on the call now that you can reduce the impact of businesses with high stress losses.
We made some really good progress against non-comp expenses and maintained comp discipline before we really got into the meat of Project Streamline.
So we think we can build from 13%, but this business does require capital given our lending focus.
Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc. And one of the questions we're getting quite a bit is how we should reconcile the revised fully phased in capital allocations that you have with essentially a CCAR required or spot required capital target; potentially, the minimum level of capital you'll need for CCAR to get through the test unscathed while also supporting higher payouts.
Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc. As it relates to your G-SIB scores, clearly you've made significant progress in reducing your RWAs. And some of your peers have noted they've moved into lower buckets.
It was on the fixed income RWAs. But also recognize that that number might bounce around a bit based on client activity, but we're pretty happy with the progress we've made.
I guess really nice margin expansion in Wealth Management, but organic growth just remains poor or weak, whether measured by fee-based flows or financial advisor head count.
I'm just curious if you think organic growth is necessary for the long-term health of this business?
I just want to understand, specifically within FIC as it relates to your broader guidance, would the business have been profitable at the current run rate of revenues given the expense reduction?
Good morning, thanks for taking my question.
Jon, at what point this quarter, if at all, did you all think about utilizing the de minimis exception to potentially increase your buybacks this quarter since they've been pretty steady at the $625 million level over the course of this current CCAR cycle?
",49.99,0.8363679
morganstanley,q2,2016,"We made particular progress in fixed income and commodities where we generated approximately $1.3 billion in revenue, up significantly from the first quarter.
Profit before taxes for the quarter was $2.5 billion versus $1.7 billion in 1Q 2016 highlighting the operating leverage we have in the business model.
Fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenues were $1.3 billion, up 49% versus the first quarter.
Wealth management performed well in the second quarter with revenues of $3.8 billion, up 4% sequentially.
First just a question on fixed, obviously a very solid result, and you alluded to post Brexit activity, but generally, if you could comment on the ability to produce $1 billion plus quarterly revenue in say despite as youÂve pointed out the sale of the oil merchanting and the 25% headcount reduction, at the end of last year, is there any warning on sustainability here that you want to issue and if not, maybe just give us a sense for how it is that you could have done a headcount reduction that wasn't as significant as it was and still see revenue in that kind of range.
I think as you know when we laid out our plan in the beginning of the year, we talked about being a critical incredibly size fixed income business that was relevant to our clients, but also supported are other businesses.
Year-to-date, our performance is at around $2.1 billion to $2.2 million so it's in-line with that revenue footprint.
Oil prices going from 38 to 48 versus the wild swings that we saw in the first quarter, so broadly a very strong performance.
We made a lot of changes that we think will help this business and this will take time, but we've been pleased with the progress that we have seen to date.
Listen, my view was that there was a general overreaction to the underperformance of FIC and from the middle of last year through the first half of the first quarter and I saw very little downside risk to the business.
And we came to a fundamental view at the end of last year to do two things, one is to realign the staff for what we thought was a $1 billion run rate business and maybe it's more and maybe we're not going to get ahead of ourselves obviously there's more this quarter.
And with that come lots of operational synergies, risk management synergies, overall management client coverage synergies with our SRM our senior relationship management program and I think that wasn't going to evidence itself in the days and weeks following the realignment, but we felt pretty confident in the months and years following it, it would and maybe we're starting to see some of that.
Thirdly just on the particular mix of our business, obviously we're more credit centric to macro, but we do have a very good FX business that benefited, you have seen a lot more volatility in rates and clearly the credit markets as Jon said recovered not just in the core fixed income business, but in commodities.
So, the combination of all of these things said that yes it's a good number this quarter.
And again just to add to this one because it is a critical question, I think that one has to take into account that the wealth management market in this country is actually extremely diverse.
Do you think that that opportunity allowed you to over earn somewhat in FIC this quarter or at least present a more unusual and robust revenue opportunity, which is why you were able to punch above that $1 billion per quarter run rate, and as we think about that run rate seasonally, when we look into the back half, should we think about that being lower or is it going to be less seasonal because of the changes you made to the business?
So, the way we would describe Brexit in the impact, I think in the first quarter if you recall and then through sort of the conference season we said that January and February were very challenging markets.
So good luck with that, but we take a slightly longer term view and again, our base case is billion dollar run rate a quarter we think is what the business should be producing in this time and environment and if it does better than that great, and that's kind of where we are at.
As you think about this business a bit longer term, as well and you think about some of the changes that are coming, from a regulatory perspective, how much do you anticipate your product shelf for commission accounts may be impacted?
And we also saw this quarter some of the streamline initiatives that are ultimately going to help this business.
But we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow this business going forward, even though we have seen lower levels of engagement given the uncertainty in the market.
And then last question, you had a good quarter, but still just an ROE of 8.3%, I think I heard you reiterate the 9% to 11% target for 2017, so what's left.
It feels good in this environment, but the 8.3% also recall as Jon pointed out the tax rate was pretty high this quarter.
Obviously, we have a pretty concrete game plan on the quarter around going forward around what we can do in wealth management where rates ultimately will impact the pipeline that we have in the investment banking calendar, and I think the broader changes going on in the global investment banking industry.
I know you're not going to give us the number, but I'm looking for anything directional on, profitability must have improved a lot given headcounts down 25%, RWA is down a lot and revenues are now well.
Part of that was the commodities business and you have since sold Oil Merchanting, IÂm just curious, not for next quarter, but just as a general comment the pacing of that $4 billion a year target goal, whatever you want to call it.
At the end of the quarter, we saw a spike as you said supporting our clients, a lot of that was in sort of low intensity RWA assets and that sort of drives the discrepancy there.
On the second point, I think the target that we laid out is the 37% - ISG comp ratio year-to-date 36% I think looking over the total year is more important than any given quarter but we are also benefiting from the headcount changes that we made in the fourth quarter.
If we do get some opportunity as we get into next year that you get to release a chunk, when you think about where that ratio is, where your SLR is, and if you are able to release capital from a business mix standpoint, do you feel like you guys are where you need to be and the gist of it is if you are able to release the capital obviously you will see one can come down but your SLR will be somewhat impacted.
You guys hit on cost and the margins, I think James you mentioned in terms of the transaction part of the business, theyÂre relatively low just given retail engagement.
We feel good about the investments that we are making around the GOL but I think itÂs still little early to say.
You have continued good loan growth this quarter, deposits were down a little bit versus last quarter but still up nicely year-over-year.
So as I mentioned, $3 billion of loan growth this quarter, $5 billion year-to-date, continued good growth there and I think we feel pretty good about that trend.
I think the investments that we are making into digital and some of the cash management products make us feel good about our ability to continue to grow broadly our deposit base and again I think the bank strategy has been a real bright spot for us and we would expect that to continue going forward.
May be we could just sort of dig into the RWA decline this quarter, I think you were down $20 billion, FIC was down $8 billion, so you actually had more outside of FIC.
I think the composition of our book as you said we are making some minor, we continue to bring down our FIC RWAs but we made a lot of progress there, so I would expect it to be pretty comparable.
And given the reduction that we've seen over the last couple of quarters and many of your more risk intensive assets, where do you believe the surcharge is today and how you are thinking about managing to that going forward given some of the opportunities not just to mitigate but potentially to even grow in some of the trading areas as competitors return?
As we said in the past, we're going to continue to try to manage and mitigate that if we can.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
IÂll make a few brief introductory remarks and then Jon will take you through the numbers and of course we both as always look forward to your questions.
Our team had several objectives coming into the quarter as follows: managing the uncertain macroeconomic environment; continuing the momentum we are building in fixed income while preserving stability in our other businesses; maintaining expense discipline; and obtaining approval for our capital plan under CCAR.
We saw continued stability and progress in our core businesses with each performing roughly in line with expectations given the environment.
On expenses, we remain focused on our cost discipline but tactically and through project streamline.
As we said publicly, we consider this outcome suboptimal, but it did indeed provide us with a live stress scenario as we endured record high volumes and spikes of volatility, our liquidity remains strong, our systems ran smoothly and our clients access the market quickly and in size.
Commodities benefited from better credit performance and market conditions, specifically a stabilization in energy credits resulting in an increase in client activity.
Other revenues were up versus first quarter, primarily driven by better credit performance for a held for investment and held for sale relationship loans.
Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $517 million, essentially flat versus 1Q.
Investment revenues in the quarter improved to $50 million versus a loss in 1Q 2016, driven by improved performance across a number of funds including private equity and real estate investments.
Investment revenues remained volatile as global markets and asset prices adjust to the changing political landscape and growth dynamic.
As the coming months unfold, we will remain nimble where we see client opportunities, while staying rigorous to our project streamline and other expense initiatives.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski, with Autonomous Research.
Hey Guy, itÂs Jon. I highlighted SBG tightening spreads help, strong performance in agencies, FX was aided by the volatility we saw from Brexit, commodities clearly better credit performance we had a much more stable backdrop.
Okay that answers the question quite robustly thank you.
Secondly, efficiencies around automation; that will be helpful not only from an expense standpoint, but also giving FAs and clients more time to be together and not focus on paperwork and doing other things like that.
Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
Second question, retail clients on the sidelines due to Brexit, have they come off the sidelines what are you seeing among retail investors now?
Okay Jon. 15% year-on-year, but GAAP assets had actually increased, I think in your prepared remarks you said something about supporting client activity related to Brexit, but just curious if you could expand on that a little bit, RWA following GAAP assets up more...
I'm not sure if I caught this right, but on the cash equity business, did you say it was up sequentially, pretty surprising given industry volumes were lower just I was curious if you guys gaining share or any particular initiatives anything you can buck the general industry trends.
And your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
Our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
But I think the critical point to recognize here is we did increase our capital return this year and our minimum ratios through the stress test actually improved across the board, both the Tier 1 and RWA ratios but also the leverage ratio was up about 30 basis points.
Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Nomura.
Again, I think I tried to answer this question clearly not as well as people had liked.
Thanks, Jon. James, actually at the Morgan Stanley financials conference, you made a comment regarding loan penetration levels among some of your retail clients.
The 16% number actually struck me a bit high and yet we continue to see really strong growth within that channel.
",55.41,0.77332306
morganstanley,q3,2016,"While some of that benefit is related to lower revenues, the vast majority of the 200 expense initiatives identified internally are yielding results and will continue to be carried out through year-end 2017.
We also said we wanted to maintain the revenue footprint while reducing the balance sheet, the capital, the expenses, and the headcount in this business.
If you look not quarter-over-quarter but year-over-year around occupancy, around T&E around some of the professional services that $800 million I'm not going to go line by line there is some benefits from the fact that revenues are down a bit, but we feel confident that we're going to hit both or the $1 billion target which obviously includes compensation savings.
You had a great result in capital return but capitals buildings is this high class problem you have, I think you'd be at the high-end of your ROE target range now if you had a similar capital ratio to the peers and you're above 10 on a tangible so.
We have the GSIB buffer coming into play obviously there is going to be some netting against that, if I read the speeches right around the shape of the balance sheet growth and around whether one is told to buyback commitments for the nine quarters.
But this has been a multiyear restructuring, I don't think any bank has wanted to try and get ahead of the capital ratios given that all of the rules have not been fully baked in as Jon just said we're dealing with the Volcker dispositions that will happen and whatever extensions we get from June 2017 but obviously we got some dispositions going, we've got the GSIB buffer in action, the resolution plans are still working, working their way through, all the banks are resubmitting those, so there is a still a lot of moving parts.
We did take out 25% of the total headcount cost and people in December of last year and we're currently on track for the $1 billion run rate in fact a little above it but again we're not too focused on the quarter-to-quarter moves and I think the question underlying it is, the teams do something on the risk front which was sort of further standard deviations out from what we have typically been doing the last couple of years, I think the answer is clearly no.
And we can, Jon, will take you through some more details if it's more to add to it but this is the business which, as you know, and if you look at the street numbers, I think all of the banks surprised on the upside but it was a better macro environment, there was more volatility post-Brexit, there was more volatility around rates because of the Fed multiple talking voices of the Fed and the credit markets turned out.
Listen I think what we've generally said is that we feel very comfortable with our competitive position, you can see our ranking quarter-to-quarter share is sort of hard to look at because as James mentioned these businesses move around.
So we are seeing the benefit of being the number one in the world and I think you're going to see just like in many other financial services products the concentration of market share among the top players and that's what you're seeing in equity.
So we're going to continue to manage that business, we're going to continue to run those down overtime, and I think we're pretty close to the ultimate targets in that on our balance sheet perspective as it is today.
And at the low-end of the range that is 23.1% -- excuse me 23.2%, you should also recognize some seasonality in this business in terms of the expenses in the fourth quarter but again as James said and I said in my prepared remarks given the flows in managed money given the lending progress that we've made, we feel good about the margins and sort of the progress that we've made here.
And then I think in the past, you guys mentioned that you didn't expect any significant impact on revenue or expense meaning like the margin, so I just wanted to confirm that as we get more information and you guys continue to work on strategy.
Mike as I said, I think the team is going to be saying some here the next couple of weeks, so really to be fit, I don't want to get ahead of it, I will give you a lot of details.
And Mike on the second half of your question obviously there were drafts to the DOL rule out last year so we were informed when we gave you the 23% to 25% margin target.
And so just wanted to get a sense on you have more flexibility in terms of frontloading it and then when I think about I think Glenn had the question on just where the capital ratios and the ROE, you James, having too much capital definitely in this environment is a good spot to be, when you look at the global firms.
So when you look at what you guys are doing strategically in terms of focusing on wealth management, you're taking down some of the risk on the balance sheet is that starting to resonate with the regulators and so did you have the potential to get that CET1 ratio back I guess around the industry average -- versus at these elevated levels?
So for 2017 what James has said and what we said at the beginning of the year is that we were capital sufficient and we would like to try to return capital above the current levels that we have and we're going to continue to do that follow that strategy in '17.
We continue to look at inventories and manage those businesses and try to shrink where we can I mentioned that in my comments.
No again I think the way I would look at it is, we have been able to increase our capital return quite dramatically over the last several years and our ratios in CCAR last year ended up higher than the year before.
But again these things are going to bounce around quarter-over-quarter and we feel very good about the $1 billion target we set for next year.
So if you look at the 9% to 11% target, all right, what is the equity assumption underlying that relative to where we are today, is it continue to capital accretion and net income is just expanding ahead of that accretion or is it some expectation of reduction?
Well again I think when we laid out the 9% to 11% for 2017 in the beginning of the year, we said we had sufficient capital and therefore we wanted to try to maintain that capital level.
May be quick follow-up in the ROE targets the 9% to 11% next year you are sticking with this but as we look at the presentation from January you were sort of under the expectation that revenue growth would be 3% to 5% annually obviously year-to-date that -- we haven't hit those numbers.
Listen, I think we've shown some really good progress against the goals as you do mention the revenues are down '16 versus '15 year-to-date.
As I mentioned some of the flows and where we are in terms of our assets under management and our lending progress helps position our business for '17 continued leadership in equities and IBD where we like our positions in our global footprint.
I think CET1 clearly very strong but the SLR I guess is where if you look at your progress to-date, it's been not as rapid on the RWA side in fixed income is that what's driving the slower progress on the SLR and you still feel confident you can get to the targets?
Fixed income is on course for an annualized quarterly revenue run rate of $1 billion per quarter and project streamlines progress is evidenced in 73.3% efficiency ratio this quarter.
We remain on track to achieve our objective of reducing expenses by $1 billion by year-end 2017 on flat revenues.
Year-to-date non-compensation expenses have decreased by approximately $800 million or 10% versus the same period last year.
Further last year's restructuring of fixed income sales and trading continues to be a tailwind through the overall non-compensation expenses base.
ISG net revenues were $4.6 billion essentially unchanged on a sequential basis.
Compensation expenses were $1.7 billion and year-to-date our ISG comp ratio was 36%.
Revenues were down 12% versus the strong second quarter impacted by a lack of specific macro events, a muted underwriting calendar, and light volumes that are traditionally seen over the summer months.
Third quarter results were driven by continued strength in derivatives as performance was aided by a number of meaningful corporate transactions underscoring the collaboration and cooperation across our investment bank.
Other revenues were up versus the second quarter primarily driven by gains on our relationship and event held-for-sale loans as a result of an improved credit improvement.
Asset management revenues increased 2% quarter-over-quarter reflecting positive flows and generally higher indices.
Transactional revenues of $791 million this quarter were largely unchanged from Q2 but down sequentially when excluding the impact of mark to market gains on our deferred compensation plans as client engagement remains subdued.
Asset management fees for the quarter were $508 million essentially unchanged versus 2Q 2015.
Investment revenues in the quarter were $51 million essentially unchanged versus last quarter reflecting a more stable investing environment.
Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.
Number two the premise around streamline was a $1 billion expenses assuming a flat revenue environment.

morganstanley,q4,2016,"The restructure in fixed income made a year ago was consistent with our objective to have a credible and critically sized business that was relevant to our clients and supported adjacencies that exist with our ISG and wealth management franchises.
The FedÂs actions in December and expected rate increased in 2017 and 2018 combined with a more positive investor sentiment lead us to believe there is real upside to the business over the next several years.
As you know, with Project Streamline last year, weÂve committed to reducing $1 billion of expenses by 2017, assuming flat revenues.
All three of our major business lines produced strong results with total net revenues of $4.6 billion, essentially flat to the third quarter.
In investment banking, we generated $1.3 billion in revenue, a 15% increase over the third quarter.
As you pointed out, you met a lot of your objectives for the year, and I guess it points to the question specifically in fixed income, given that youÂve maintained that target at $4 billion, or a billion dollars quarterly, and even in what was a terrible year last year, you managed 4.3, I think, and this year you did 5.1.
By the same token, looking at Slide 13 where you show 23% to 25% margin target in wealth management and then youÂve got a question mark on 2018 and 2019, it looks as if youÂve drawn the 2018 bar a bit higher, though.
Let me try and take that one, Guy. I think as you point out, the wealth business and the NII in that business is clearly the most sensitive to rates.
I think what weÂre saying for 2017 is that we still expect NII growth, albeit at a somewhat slower pace, and itÂs probably going to be more mixed in terms of where that comes from.
I canÂt exactly remember, but in the first quarter of Â16, I think the forward curve was showing maybe one or half a rate increase.
We said a billion dollars of expenses should add about 100 basis points of ROE, and therefore the revenue growth was going to generate the difference.
So again, I think in light of the last three quarters that weÂve put up close to $9 billion and sort of, as James said, on average about an 8.5% ROE, we see a clear line of sight to that 9 to 11, and we feel pretty confident about it.
Just looking at the business, the comp ratio did tick down slightly this year, about 50 BPs, so continuing to grind that lower, but admittedly the mix, particularly towards higher margin NII, would have suggested that maybe we should have seen a little bit more progress.
We would expect to continue to grow NII, not--itÂs obviously a bigger number and so growth rates will slow down, but we feel very good about the margin and the net interest income opportunity, and that will clearly drive an increase in our margin.
So you know, while we could probably accelerate the comp ratio decline, IÂm not sure that would be good for the medium and long-term growth of the business, which weÂre all focused on at the same time.
one of them was 3 to 5% revenue growth, one of them was continued progress on our capital return, because obviously ROE is a function of both the equity and the earnings, and the third was no one-time large enforcement-slash-litigation--you know, financial crisis-type events.
Obviously if thereÂs a very difficult revenue environment this year, we stand by our original predictions that weÂre subject to, and I donÂt think weÂre going to need to be at the 3 to 5% revenue growth to get there, but certainly if we had a negative revenue environment, thatÂd be a different issue.
Then as far as your progress in trading, youÂre gaining market share in equities for sure, and it looks like a little bit in fixed income.
The equity pool in terms of the revenue or the wallet looks like it will shrink for the year - we havenÂt seen everyoneÂs results yet, and we had the opposite phenomenon in fixed income where it looks like the pools have been getting a little bit bigger sort of quarter to quarter.
In terms of where that share is coming from, itÂs sort of hard to discern, but I would say one of the things that weÂve been very proud of and very focused on is keeping the global network intact as we restructured and changed our businesses around the globe, and I think that global network is accruing benefits to us as weÂve seen others around the globe sort of disrupted or distracted, based on the events going on.
So I get it that there is some uncertainty in the revenue environment, but you guys highlighted it seems like momentum continues to improve, specifically FIC looks stable, exceeding targets with lower capital, equities strong, and II starting to benefit from rate uplift, and risk appetite is expanding and transactional revenues are starting to improve in wealth management.
The second point I would make on your Tier 1, I think it was your CET 1 question, itÂs just around we had--our buyback and our preferred and common dividends sort of offset our earnings, and then you saw a movement in our AOTI.
Just a few on wealth management, and some of these are just clean-ups; but I think, Jon, you mentioned some expense items in this quarter.
You will see that in the results in the wealth management business, that weÂve taken that number from under $2 billion a couple years ago to $3.5 billion in NII, and we would expect that to continue to grow, and that will obviously help the margin in that business.
We donÂt think in the certainly short, medium, maybe even long term itÂs going to be a large part of our business - thatÂs not our presumption.
I guess the two parts of my question are, on the one hand, as long as the CCAR process exists, obviously there will be constraints on how much capital presumably can be returned in any given period of time; and on the other hand, youÂve sort of right-sized your fixed footprint and so itÂs now consuming less RWA than it has historically.
Clearly over the last couple years, our balance sheet has sort of been flat to down, but as we see some increased activity and client activity across the globe, there is an opportunity to invest that back into our core businesses, so thatÂs another area that potentially looks like there could be an opportunity this year, whereas I would say last year it didnÂt feel like we were in that same spot.
Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets.
On the beta question, thereÂs obviously been a lot of discussion around betas, mostly because weÂre now in an environment of rising rates where we havenÂt seen one in eight years, so everyone is sort of using models that are based on historical practices, and we obviously have seen also money market reform and some changes in the structure of the markets.
Again, I think itÂs very hard to look at net interest income in ISG, particularly the sales and trading businesses.
WeÂre actually trying to keep common equity flat, as we think we have sufficient capital to run our businesses based on the current size, shape and risk profile of the company.
Yeah, but if interest rates keep rising and if the impact is similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter, your common equity is going to continue to fall.
Our capital--our average equity was down $400 million, I think, quarter over quarter, so again on a roughly $70 billion base, it wasnÂt a dramatic decline.
First of all, Jon, in investment management, obviously the fourth quarter numbers were a little bit skewed by the loss, but first of all, can you tell us a little more detail as to why you took those charges, and in the bigger picture youÂre still above the 40% target for comp to net revenues in that business, and how confident are you, you can get to that by 2017?
They were investments that were made going on 10 years ago when we made the risk decision to exit those positions, and we did and sort of took the charge that you saw in the fourth quarter of $60 million.
In terms of the comp ratio, to be fair, as you know, carry runs through that line item, so the comp ratio target that we put out there, itÂs really quite volatile and I donÂt think weÂre going to--you know, depending on what the investment environment is, it sort of perverts if we have a lot of carry gains.
The one thing I will tell you is that if you look at--you donÂt have the ability to parse this through the different line items, but the non-carry related comp expense is actually down as a percentage of the fee-based revenue, so we are exhibiting good expense discipline in that business, but it will be volatile based on carry and investment gains.
No, IÂm saying weÂre going to continue to try to make progress in those line items, but--and we feel good that there are probably some more opportunities.
We have taken them down pretty dramatically from the 417 into the 340s, so we think there is still some optimization there; but we feel good about the size of this business and the results that its generated.
Good morning, this is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations.
On relatively flat annual revenues in Â16, we reduced non-compensation expenses significantly and continued to exercise discipline on compensation.
We also achieved record pre-tax earnings of $3.4 billion in the face of a number of macro headwinds, including sustained low interest rates and muted retail investor engagement.
Assuming normal market conditions prevail, as they did over the last three quarters when our ROE averaged 8.5%, we remain on target for our 9% to 11% goal for 2017.
This should help us realize the remaining savings potential in 2017 and maintain operating leverage in a rising revenue environment.
This includes deepening our relationships in prime brokerage as well as focusing on providing content, capital, and execution services to clients in flow trading.
Over the past few years, weÂve consistently increased our dividend and significantly increased our total payout to approximately $5 billion while also growing our common equity base.
We have noticeably reduced marketing and business development costs by actively managing discretionary spending combined with price renegotiations.
We continue to benefit from shutting down the two North American data centers and remain on track to close two additional ones last year.
Sales and trading revenues were flat sequentially, weathering seasonal trends, demonstrating strong and consistent performance throughout the quarter.
Revenues in the Americas has particularly strong growth as investor optimism and trading activity improved after the election.
Q4 revenues of just under $1.5 billion were seasonally strong and essentially unchanged from the third quarter.
The business reported asset management fees of $512 million and AUM of $417 billion, both essentially unchanged versus 3Q.
Our capital position remains strong.
We did this by improving our cost discipline and executing strategic initiatives, including our bank strategy and our fixed income restructuring, while retaining leadership positions in areas of traditional strength of equities and investment banking.
Recently, increased investor optimism and more constructive markets are positive signs for our businesses.
Clearly mortgage will probably slow down a little bit given the increase in rates, but SBL and the tailored lending product continues to show good growth, so weÂll see some average earning asset growth that will drive that.
YouÂd previously indicated at the last strategic update that hitting the 9% was really contingent on delivering mid-single digit revenue growth per year, and it looks like consensus is modeling somewhere closer to low single digit, so instead of your 3% to 5%, somewhere closer to 2%.
But given the significant progress youÂve made on the cost side, IÂm just wondering whether you can still hit the 9% even if revenue outlook materializes more in line with consensus.
Just wanted to get a sense as to what factors have impacted your ability to drive more meaningful comp leverage, and maybe how much incremental margin upside we could see from higher rates, alluding to GuyÂs question about the rising column chart in terms of margin progress beyond 2017.
Within that, IÂm curious if thatÂs just all-natural progression as youÂve basically doubled the fee-based assets over the last seven years, and where you think that natural resting ground will be as DOL may be coming into play in a couple months.
I think you did something along those lines in the 1Q fixed income presentation last year, so perhaps you can give an update on that.
Hi. There has been a lot of focus on the asset sensitivity within the wealth management unit specifically, but I was wondering if you could comment on how the overall balance sheet is positioned for rising rates, including the institutional securities unit and investment management.
You guys have made great progress on the FIC RWAs, I think almost at your end state already, well ahead of schedule.
",52.46,0.8377493
morganstanley,q1,2017,"TodayÂs presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
Other priorities included achieving a wealth management pre-tax margin of 23% to 25%, delivering on project streamline and improving results across our fixed income division.
These priorities were consistent -- were contingent upon modest revenue growth, a continuation of our capital distribution plan and the absence of any outsized litigation expenses or penalties.
Wealth management recorded a pre-tax margin well within our target range, and the fixed income division delivered revenues meaningfully north of our $1 billion average quarterly goal.
These public markers, combined with continued strength in investment banking, leadership and equities and improved returns in investment management, all contributed to one of the strongest quarters in recent history.
Given Morgan StanleyÂs very strong capital and liquidity position potential modifications could substantially impact us over the coming years.
Compared to the fourth quarter, non-interest expenses of $6.9 billion were up approximately $160 million or 2%.
This increase was driven by higher compensation expenses, which rose 9% sequentially due to higher revenues and the impact of mark-to-market on our deferred compensation plans across the firm.
Year-over-year revenues were up $2 billion while non-compensation expenses increased by only $100 million over the same period.
Our businesses built on Q4 momentum and produced strong results with total net revenue of $5.2 billion, up 12% quarter-over-quarter.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 7% sequentially driven by lower seasonal expenses, partially offset by higher execution related costs.
The increase was driven by strong underwriting results across both debt and equity, partially offset by a decline in advisory revenues.
Turning to underwriting, continued investor optimism combined with stable capital markets characterized by low volatility and tighter credit spreads, translated into strong underwriting activity in the first quarter.
While equity volumes are still well below peak levels, Q1 represented a more constructive new issue market with low overall volatility and fewer specific risk events.
Against this backdrop and with a strong pipeline coming into the new year, equity underwriting revenues were $390 million, up 73% versus the fourth quarter.
Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 26% sequentially to $531 million, driven by strength in investment grade bond and high yield financing issuance in attractive credit environment.
Now turning to Wealth Management .In the first quarter, we reported record revenues of $4.1 billion, representing 2% sequential increase.
We witnessed increased fee-based asset flows, additional lending, better client engagement and eliminate FA attrition.
Higher asset levels and positive flows were largely offset by the effect of fewer calendar days in the quarter.
The steady increase in fee based assets position us well to build our annuatized revenues.
Market appreciation and equities and fixed income, and positive flows and alternative products, contributed to a modest uptick versus 4Q16.
Asset management fees for the quarter were stable at $517 million.
Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $360 billion, down $10 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by lower operational risk RWAs. The reduction in RWAs contributed to a 70 basis point increased in our pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.6%, bringing it more in line with our pro forma fully phased in Basel III standardized common equity Tier 1 ratio.
Our M&A and underwriting pipelines remain healthy and macro events should continue to provide opportunities for our trading businesses.
May be a quick question on -- you guys seemingly loss but gave up little market share when you trim 25% of the workforce, but it's obviously a strong momentum.
Maybe IÂll try a little bit more color on FIG business, and obviously the great growth over the last four quarters.
In addition to the obvious uncertainties, there are two notable policy areas that could meaningfully affect us in a positive way in the next several years; first, the potential for reduction of the domestic corporate tax rate.
Importantly, we produced results characteristic of constructive markets and we controlled expenses, highlighting the operating leverage in our business.
As I mentioned earlier in the year, we had the capital capacity to increase our balance sheet if the client opportunities and returns justify the usage.
As James said in the opening, the strong results this quarter provide support that our strategy is working.
However, questions around timing and achievability of the new administrationÂs policy initiatives, resulted in more sporatic client activity towards the end of the first quarter.
The 2017 plan is we've had I think four or five years of dividend and capital increases.
On the regulatory front, there's huge moving parts, I mean -- and on fiscal policy; first the corporate tax rate, as we said, we have a large business that is almost entirely in the U.
S. financial system is demonstrably healthier than it was going into the crisis and in the years following, weÂve reached a point where the amount of capital burden and regulatory burden on the system and some of the elements of that and some of the lack of transparency elements are right for real change, and that has been acknowledged all the way from board members of the federal reserves on down.
But I think there are a number of very specific fixes that both relieve the expense and time consumption, now that the plans are relatively mature, without attracting all from the regulatory rigor that is necessary for strong and healthy banking system.
And do you think that that should continue to provide a nice tailwind on to the equities business broadly, just given the non-box approach.
And making it A, more consistent with the Europeans, I think there is also an argument by the way bringing the ratio, which is currently 5% of capital to the growth that balance sheet to the European level, I suppose 3%.
But I donÂt want to predict, and I'm pretty sure Jon doesnÂt either, on how that might affect our equities business and what that implies about our prime, so itÂs a little early for that.
And do you think that momentum in market share can continue given where you are currently?
And I think we feel confident that we will continue to be relevant to our clients, support other ISG businesses.
So broadly speaking, a good quarter for the businesses and the strength was pretty much across all products, except for really FX.
So want to kick things off with a question on CCAR in the capital stack, your CET1 ratio is clearly very strong.
And with the inclusion of the SLR in this upcoming test and also given the latest preferred issuance you announced, I was hoping you could just shed some light on how the introduction of the SLR constraint actually informs your thinking in terms of excess capital; and how we should expect you to manage the capital stack going forward, whether we should see some incremental pref issuance from here.
So I think that change in the second one was the balance sheets grow during the times of financial stress.
I guess the question that I have been now that is what kind of visibility might there be to reducing excess capital over time, quite apart from regulatory change, which is of course hard to forecast at this point.
We did continue to derisk the balance sheet over the course of the year, and fixed income and then you can see the results that we brought down capital in that business.
We increased our investment and the balance sheet this quarter, as I mentioned, in the sales and trading business.
So we continue to see roll down of long-dated stuff, but I think at this point, itÂs not really material and itÂs not really part of the management of the business.
I think if you're looking at the asset sensitivity or the net interest income in our wealth business, which is generally where most of the asset sensitivity is, a couple of things.
What we've seen now that we've been through three, I guess, rate hikes in the last year and change, is that the model data has been higher than what's actually happened, in terms of the deposit base.
But again, it's a model and we haven't really seen that many rate hikes over a long period of time, particularly given money market reform and digital products in terms of deposit behavior.
But our performance in wealth NII is strong and we still feel confident that we can grow that business, because of the lending products that we're offering to our clients, as well as the benefit of the forward curve this year and the potential for future rate hikes.
And we allocate liquidity to those business, so that sort of that dynamic there; but again we're number one; we feel very good about our position; our performance was very strong, particularly in Europe this quarter; its global; weÂve got a good product set and we feel very good about our position and our continued momentum there.
And our next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets.
And ultimately, do you think this kind of a risk for the business or do you see an opportunity for Morgan Stanley to take more market share?
Again, I think as you highlighted, itÂs been a good product and an important product for our clients.
",43.46,0.8663775
morganstanley,q2,2017,"TodayÂs presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
Investment banking showed continued strength, reflecting diversity of our global M&A and capital markets franchises.
Compensation expenses are in line with our stated targets and higher accruals year-to-date reflect higher revenues.
We also saw some seasonal increase in professional services, marketing and business development and higher volume driven expenses.
Net revenues across institutional securities businesses of $4.8 billion were down 8% sequentially.
The trading environment slowed from the first quarter, market moving events were episodic, volatility in many asset classes hit multi-year lows and activity was sporadic.
Turning to underwriting, our continuation of stable capital markets with low volatility and range down credit spreads contributed to another strong quarter for underwriting.
We expect activity levels to remain healthy although near-term issuance windows maybe impacted by macroeconomic uncertainties and a typical summer slowdown.
Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased 5% sequentially to $504 million, a market wide decline in volumes relative to strong first quarter was partially offset by market share gains across both investment grade bond and high yield financing.
In our credit businesses revenues were down quarter-over-quarter driven by lower levels of activity.
These results were achieved despite a normalization in activity following a strong first quarter as retail sentiment reflected the same uncertainties faced by our institutional clients.
Second quarter revenues were $4.2 billion a 2% sequential increase.
The PBT margin 25% slightly above our full-year 2017 target range reflected growth in fee based revenues and operating leverage.
Net interest income of $1 billion was up 2% over last quarter, that benefit a higher rates and lending balances was partially offset by lower deposit levels.
This reduction in deposits reflects both typical seasonal client tax payments and deployment of cash into the markets.
Lower compensation expenses were offset by seasonally higher marketing and business development and professional services expenses.
Annuitized revenue continue to grow with fee based assets and increased loan balances.
overall, AUM grew 3% to $435 billion driven by investment performance with particular strength across our active equity strategies.
We also saw positive flows across our equities, fixed income and alternative businesses with strong capital raising internationally.
First question on wealth management, I noticed the deposits down 7% I think, sometimes its seasonality and then sometimes itÂs cash deployment.
As such depreciate assets run off, new businesses not gathered, it would be hard to imagine in fact during the crisis in the years following of our own balance sheet obviously shrink dramatically both through our actions and through market activity.
Maybe an equity is trading here, weÂre six months away or within six months of method to in Europe IÂm sure there is lot of corporation at the firm right now.
In addition, there are three tailwinds worth calling out, each of which has the potential to impact our long-term performance in a material and positive way, capital, tax reform and interest rates.
Non-competition expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 6% sequentially driven by the UK VAT expense, as well as higher execution related costs due to a shift in business and geographic mix of client activity.
Historically, low volatility, a rally in interest rates over most of the quarter and fewer market events contributed to a slowdown in overall performance, while the revenue showed a sequential decline given the market backdrop, weÂre pleased with the results.
Wealth management lending in the U.S. banks grew by about $3.5 billion in the quarter or 6%, as clients drew on their SPL lines to manage liquidity needs, a trend we often witnessed in the second quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis total spot assets of $841 billion were up $9 billion and average assets were up $12 billion reflecting continued support of client activities within the sales and trading businesses.
After years of headwinds for the industry, we are finally starting to see some tailwinds that can be promising for our business in the long-term including the potential for tax reform, sensible regulatory change and a rising interest rate environment.
So thatÂs been a positive, weÂve also, if you go back to the first quarter, remember what the curve looked like, I think weÂve gotten rate hikes faster than we thought back then.
Can you give us a sense for the different business lines now that the business has been adjusted and can you also - I know you mentioned Jon that commodities were down sequentially, but was this quarter extraordinary from your perspective weÂve heard some mixed things from some of the competitors some additional color there will be great.
You know I think the way I would look at it is the results clearly just reflect the environment that we were operating in.
So, when we look at the individual product mix, as I did mention our rates business given the low volatility is down, yet our FX did a little bit stronger particularly in the emerging market areas.
So we feel good about the business, commodities are also down a little bit, less activity and a tighter trading band there, but the results reflect the moves and the changes that we made and the results reflect that the business is really starting to come together and jelling and I think we feel pretty good about the results in light of the environment.
So, wanted to started up with the question on wealth management and pre-tax margin, certainly encouraging to see that you guys eclipse the 25% target for the quarter.
IÂm just wondering as we look ahead to the second half, given a number of favorable trends for the business that Jon you had cited whether itÂs strong fee based conversions, healthy loan growth and NII expansion.
Right now, with the rates and higher markets those are good trends that will drive our asset base fees as well as our NII, our lending growth has been solid, I think the one area of potential volatility or softening is around transactional.
We saw really nice operating leverage here, we saw really nice growth across all products in the lending book and we feel very good about the results, I mean the PBT at $1 billion plus is obviously a record and itÂs a really important contributor to the overall franchise.
On the first part of the question I think clearly the reform around SLR would be helpful for a variety of reasons whether or not itÂs our binding constraint this quarter or next quarter is certainly not a foregone conclusion.
So there could be some benefit from that but we also think there is just general benefit with that calculation in terms of what it means for their overall sales and trading businesses.
But I do think there are several changes have been discussed or that are being discussed that would clearly help our position including around the balance sheet and how you think about capital actions going forward.
So I think itÂs a little early on 2018 CCAR to sort of have a prediction, but clearly we were pleased with the results, if you look back at year ago where we were versus what came out of the report a couple of weeks ago with a 100%ish payout and a 33% increase in capital return and a clean report weÂre very pleased.
I would just add on the leverage ratio, specifically, we have argued for a number of years and present to regulators for a number of years that the fact that a balance sheet growth during the time of financial stress is hard to understand how that happens.
So the leverage ratio constraint is made more acute by the fact that the denominator is growing at I think itÂs about 4.5% a year for the nine quarters.
But I donÂt think, the point of setting the target to establish, what we needed to prove to ourselves on an average run rate for the business to justify the expenses in capital balance sheet that we put behind it at that level.
You saw the RWAs bounce a little bit this quarter, that was consistent with sensible business growth, there was opportunity clearly Tier-1 capital ratio is another constraint or no way near it.
I think clearly, I think there is a general recognition from the regulators all the way through the treasury that the Volcker Rule as it play out overtime straight a fair bit distance from Paul Walker initially envisaged, which was a simple restriction on the amount of capital put into proprietary invest and proprietary trading and but then frankly constrained on the ability of institutions to make markets and effective market liquidity.
Maybe first here just in wealth management, youÂve recently outlined the digitalization strategy, which was very helpful and with respect to the [robo] (Ph) offering, it sounds like youÂre not going to be able to focus on the children of the existing clients and some lower balance accounts which does seem to mark us with this generation of wealth transfer coming here and where the money is going to be over the next several decades.
So as we think about that process, how do you protect against maybe some cannibalization of existing business as clients look at the lower price point.
You know I guess the question is a revenue opportunity here just much more of an offset or do you just not think this as something that would appeal to some of your existing higher net worth clients for a portion of their accounts, itÂs a just a different bucket.
We had the same issue last year around DFAS and people sort of concerned with our outcome and about 100% payout ratio continue to increased capital return, part of our core strategy.
And our view is that, the way we calculate our capital needs to run our business, we continue to have excess above that, but weÂre waiting for the outcome of the white paper and the various efforts from the regulators to see what changes take place, there are clearly going to be changes.
And the next question comes from the line of Gerrard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
The real story for us is as you mentioned has been in the wealth business as we continue to increase the penetration of our client base with lending products.
And we feel like weÂve got good momentum in the growth last quarter at $3.5 billion was pretty balanced across the business a little bit more skewed towards SPL and tailored versus mortgage given what happened in rates, but again that lending story we feel very good about, our levels of penetration of how many of our clients have lending products is still probably a bit below peer level.
",45.43,0.7924663
morganstanley,q3,2017,"While the third quarter was impacted by the typical summer slowdown across many of our businesses, our results reaffirmed that we can generate solid returns against a more subdued backdrop.
These investments include not only our digital build-out but also further enhancements to our advisory platforms, lending cash management products and integrated, goal-based planning solutions.
Sales & Trading was impacted by the environment, characterized by a seasonal slowdown, muted client activity and low levels of volatility.
Fixed Income remained above our $1 billion run rate per our average quarterly revenue goal, and Investment Management exhibited steady performance with a combination of positive flows across our actively managed strategies.
Often an underappreciated part of our firm, Investment Management represents a high-returning business with a complementary mix of traditional and alternative platforms.
Incremental revenue is expected to generate higher margins, assuming we continue to manage our cost base with discipline.
Despite this somewhat uninspired trading environment, results remained solid with strong performance in Investment Banking and Investment Management and consistent revenue growth in Wealth Management.
Fixed Income underwriting revenues decreased 12% sequentially to $442 million, driven primarily by lower investment-grade issuance.
High-yield markets have continued to be very receptive to both acquisition financing and opportunistic refinancings, aided by range-bound credit spreads, low volatility and significant market liquidity.
In Sales & Trading, we supported our clients when opportunities presented themselves and prudently managed risk throughout the quarter.
Sequentially, Europe was weaker coming off a seasonally high second quarter, but continued strength in Asia buoyed our results.
And cash revenues remain stable as lower volumes and subdued volatility were combined with a more benign market-making environment.
Our macro businesses were negatively impacted by sequentially lower results in foreign exchange and persistently low levels of volatilities in rates, where client activity remain muted.
Lastly, average trading VaR for the period was $43 million, down versus $51 million last quarter, primarily driven by lower market volatility across both equity and fixed income markets.
Turning to Wealth Management, which reported further growth in both revenues and pretax profits relative to last quarter's record levels.
Our business continues to benefit from a shift towards an advice-driven model with a decreased reliance on transactional activity.
This quarter's results further underscored this trend as growth in asset management revenues more than offset the seasonal slowdown in transactional revenues.
Investment Management witnessed another solid quarter with continued growth in asset management fees and strong investment results.
We will continue to opportunistically evaluate tactical acquisitions across our Investment Management platform as we further grow this high-return business.
Maybe just on the Wealth Management side, you guys had very good growth -- sequential growth in deposits.
We have a relatively narrow but very productive active asset management business on the long-only side.
And when you think about balancing not only the payment for research but also the enhanced liquidity throughout European trading operations, how do you manage the potential impact of spreads through that enhanced transparency?
And maybe a broader question on how you're thinking about capital management and some strategic growth initiatives.
Incremental revenues will continue to drive margin improvement, subject, of course, to decisions to invest in initiatives that have the potential to further accelerate growth.
We continued to see signs of operating leverage across our business model, not just in Wealth Management, where it's most apparent.
Going forward, our focus will be on ensuring that the savings achieved to date are kept permanently out of the expense base in an effort to maximize operating leverage across all of our businesses.
Our year-to-date compensation to net revenue ratio was approximately 35%, in line with our target of 37% or lower.
We expect healthy activity levels in the fourth quarter, subject to issuance windows remaining open, which may be impacted by macro-economic uncertainties, geopolitical events and a typical seasonal slowdown at the end of the year.
We have continued to support our clients and have generated revenues in excess of the $1 billion goal for 6 consecutive quarters against a variety of market backdrops.
Fee-based asset inflows were $16 billion in the quarter, contributing to a record year-to-date flows.
Higher asset levels and strong quarterly flows contributed to asset management revenues of $2.4 billion, representing 4% growth relative to the second quarter.
Net interest income of $1 billion is up 2% over the last quarter, reflecting the benefit from both higher rates and lending balances.
Wealth Management lending in the U.S. banks grew by about $1 billion in the quarter or 2%.
Continued strength in loan production offset the impact of higher paydowns in the quarter.
With year-to-date net interest income of $3 billion, up approximately 19% year-on-year, we remain on our way to generate full year NII growth in line with the guidance we had provided.
This quarter's performance clearly demonstrates the strength of the franchise and the powerful combination of a highly annuitized revenue mix and the operating leverage that comes from a scale platform.
We continued to enhance this business profile by investing in our advisory platforms, digital capabilities and banking and lending products.
Can you discuss where you saw deposit rates in Wealth Management business and how you were able to attract, I think, about $10 billion sequentially on deposit franchise?
So we've built out those products, particularly around our cash management engaged initiatives around savings products as well as CDs and other products to sort of supplement our deposit base.
We did, at the end of the second quarter raise our rates across the platform in the broker deposit channel.
And maybe, just the follow-up, just on your asset management acquisitions, you've got sort of a new tone, I guess, or more aggressive tone about further acquisitions.
I think there are a bunch of areas across the asset management platform we could continue to build out.
So I think what we're signaling, and Jim, you're picking up on it, is we're open for business to find inorganic pieces that can help build out parts of our platform that make sense.
I think in terms of stickiness, as James has mentioned and I have mentioned, we are seeing more of our clients engage with us on the advisory platforms.
Number one, we are the #1 equities business globally with a sort of -- with an integrated platform and a leading research product.
And maybe a question on the margins inside Wealth Management, obviously a big number this quarter.
I guess, that's sort of the early question around, ""Are we going to change our margin targets or whatever?"" Listen, the incremental dollar revenue is coming on with an incremental higher margin than the embedded margin.
And what the management team in that business is doing is looking for ways in which we can drive further growth over the next several years rather than trying to grind out a particular margin in a particular quarter.
We still have some, given that we've just raised the deposit number from the $144 billion to $154 billion, we do have excess liquidity today to continue to fund lending growth going forward.
We do -- we would like to continue to build out this cash management engaged initiative, which should bring in savings deposits, some mix.
And especially in light of DOL implementation likely to be delayed and potentially tabled, how should we think about the pace of fee-based conversions from here as that seemed to provide a nice tailwind to some of the acceleration that we saw in recent quarters?
Number two, as we continue to build out the goals-based platform, as we continue to build out digital and our other services, I think our clients are attracted to the value-added proposition of a managed account and we see that trend continuing.
Well, again, I would say that we've seen continued growth in the lending product across Wealth Management across the 3 products, mortgage, securities-based loans and tailored product.
Based on market data, it suggests that our penetration rates are lower than some others, so we think that we continue to have room both on the SBL and on the mortgage product.
We've hit that each quarter; efficiency ratio driven by Project Streamline of 74% expense to revenue, and we've been below that for the 3 quarters; Wealth Management margin, 23% to 25%, and we're now operating above that level; and the fourth, of course, was the Fixed Income division's revenues, which we thought, given what the team did with the restructuring in the fourth quarter '15, I think it was, we thought that the business model stood on its own with about $1 billion in revenue.
I don't think there's a lot of point in trying to nail ourselves to a specific revenue target for a business as volatile as that.
I guess I step back and I think that your businesses are higher expense-based in general, but you also have leading market shares in a lot of what you do, have been executing well, as you pointed out, in getting the efficiency ratio down, you're exceeding your plan this year.
Wealth Management is obviously higher because of the payout structure in that business, but it's been grinding lower over time as non-compensable revenues come onstream.
The non-comp expenses in Wealth Management, I think, Jon, were down a little bit this quarter on significantly higher revenues.
And I think what you're going to see with every $1 of incremental revenue, you will still see a higher incremental margin coming on even with those investments.
As I said, we saw a lot of engagement with our clients with the cash and money market balances going down.

morganstanley,q4,2017,"Page 3 of the strategic update shows our reported results and our results adjusted to exclude the aggregate impact of net discrete tax provision in the fourth quarter that resulted from the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act and other intermittent net discrete tax benefits unrelated to the Tax Act. These adjusted operating performance metrics will be utilized throughout the remainder of this presentation in order to assess our strategic objective established in 2016.
Looking forward, with these targets achieved and a solid strategy in place, our management team will continue to work towards generating sustained high returns by investing for growth while maintaining fiscal vigilance and capital sufficiency.
Slide 9 shows as we look forward and outline areas for organic growth and further operational improvement.
This lending growth is supported by a high-quality deposit base, which is sourced predominantly from our existing Wealth Management client footprint.
At the same time, we continue to optimize our expense base while still investing in future growth initiatives, including our digital offering.
Transactional activity, historically a more volatile source of revenues, has been significantly reduced and offset by growth in net interest income and fee-based revenue.
Slide 13 summarizes the future growth and margin opportunities in Wealth Management.
This target was premised on an expectation that we would be able to grow both net interest and noninterest revenues while maintaining expense discipline.
Achieving this revised target will be dependent on executing on a number of revenue and expense initiatives that are outlined on the right-hand side of the page.
Recall that we expect the margin to be positively impacted in excess of 100 basis points as the Smith Barney retention notes will be fully amortized by January of 2019, also at the same time we will continue to invest for growth.
Investment Banking, it had its best year post crisis, driven by strong performance in all businesses, including our ECM franchise, which ranked #1 globally in a resurgent underwriting market.
Slide 16 outlines our Investment Management business.
As I've noted before, Investment Management represents a high-returning business with opportunities for future growth.
As illustrated, a meaningful portion of our revenues come from businesses such as alternatives, high-conviction equities and emerging markets.
Approximately 2/3 of our 2017 gross sales have come from outside the U.S. Strong positive net flows from these markets represent a differentiated contributor to assets under management growth.
The examples outlined at the bottom of this slide illustrate that funds with differentiated strategies and strong investment performance tend to deliver significant AUM growth.
Optimizing our expense base has been a key driver of this approach as demonstrated by the multiple efficiency ratio targets we have set for ourselves over the years.
The increase in capital return has been executed while we've concurrently invested for future growth and maintained adequate capital levels.
Whereas the impact to the overall economic backdrop and activity levels within our business segments will only become clearer over time, we expect an immediate positive impact to our financial results in 2018.
So Slide 21 summarizes our key strategic objectives over the course of the next two years, and they include, delivering a Wealth Management pretax margin of 26% to 28%; expanding our ISG penetration and leadership across the businesses; positioning Investment Management for growth; and finally, realizing a firm efficiency ratio of 73% or better.
Together with an attractive capital return profile, the fulfillment of these targets will enable us to continue to drive ROE growth higher.
This management team is committed to executing on our strategy while looking for compelling growth opportunities in order to bring these objectives to fruition, which will provide both future profitability and performance.
Corporate clients, however, remained active, driving strong results in Investment Banking.
We have remained disciplined around compensation, achieving compensation ratios for Institutional Securities and Wealth Management below our targets of 37% and 56%, respectively.
Net revenues in our Institutional Securities business of $4.5 billion represents a 3% sequential increase.
Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion, bringing our full year compensation to net revenue ratio to 35%, an approximate 200 basis point reduction compared to 2015.
Looking at the full year, Investment Banking results benefited from the broad-based rebound in underwriting activity.
Our full year revenues were approximately $8 billion despite much of the year being impacted by historically low equity volatility.
Credit results exhibited stability against a favorable backdrop for risk assets, and our lending businesses continued to be a source of stable revenues.
The expense leverage has enabled us to maintain a substantial level of investments into our future capabilities, including our digital, banking and advisory platforms, while at the same time increasing our margins.
Full year NII growth of $576 million or 16% was driven by an increase in average loan balances of approximately $10 billion and higher rates.
In 2018, we would expect NII growth to slow based on our anticipated funding mix and higher deposit betas than we experienced in 2017.
Our AUM of $482 billion in the fourth quarter grew 8% with positive net flows across all strategies, including strong seasonal flows in our liquidity business.
As James discussed, we continue to see increased investor interest for strategies where we deliver differentiated value and strong investment performance.
Or put some numbers around it or somehow help us think about what you're efficiency target means in the context of that change.
You guys have done a very good job in increasing your market shares, particularly in trading and equity trading, even though the total wallet size has declined.
So I think you're right that there are probably a couple of institutions that would move forward in these businesses more aggressively than the last several years would suggest.
And I'm just wondering like as you step back, can you think about kind of the new regulatory environment, global growth picking up, what other areas are you thinking about strategically investing, maybe one you wouldn't before?
Investment Management is still an area that we'd like to continue both organically and inorganically look at opportunities; and if something comes around, like the Mesa West, which was a good cultural fit, good product fit and fit very nicely into the franchise.
But Wealth Management in recent years, it's certainly been helped by your strong expense discipline.
But level of engagement with clients across the complex, as James mentioned, the 10-year now backed up over 20 basis points in the last 2 weeks.
So on the NII within wealth, you -- as you know, we've actually grown that line pretty dramatically over $2.5 billion in the last 5 years, so averaging about $500 million per annum.
As illustrated in this slide, our primary focus in the early years was to put the troubles of the financial crisis behind us and to complete the full integration of the Wealth Management business.
Additionally, we will look for ways to realize the potential of our Investment Management platform, leveraging our attractive business mix, global client footprint and top-tier performing strategies.
We've witnessed material growth in our two main sources of annuitized revenues, fee-based assets and client liabilities, which produces, of course, net interest income.
In Equity Sales & Trading, we maintained our #1 position for the fourth consecutive year, with a wallet share in excess of 20%, allowing us to maintain revenues of approximately $8 billion despite a smaller wallet.
In Fixed Income Sales & Trading, we've gained share while resizing our business to one which is both critically and credibly sized and more appropriate for the wallet opportunity, and it generated more revenues than prior to the restructuring.
Going forward, our goal is to continue to drive efficiencies across the businesses and maintain a ratio below the 73% level.
As a result of our significant U.S. earnings contribution, not least here, our Wealth Management segment, we expect to see a meaningful reduction in our effective corporate tax rate.
That said, given our growth initiatives, maintaining expense discipline and recent changes to U.S. corporate tax law, we are increasing our target ROE range to 10% to 13% from 9% to 11% over the medium term.
For the fourth quarter, total noninterest expense was $7 billion, a 5% sequential increase, driven by higher compensation expense on higher revenues and seasonally higher marketing and business development and other expenses.
The 460 basis point increase in our pretax margin achieved over the 2-year period provides the best illustration of the success of the project.
Fourth quarter revenues were $4.4 billion, a 4% sequential increase contributing to a full year revenue growth of 10%.
Higher asset levels, combined with strong flows, contributed to asset management revenues of $2.5 billion, representing 3% growth relative to the third quarter.
The full year compensation to net revenue ratio was 55.6%, in line with our target.
On a full year basis, asset management fees increased 6%, in line with the growth in our average AUM.
In terms of numerator and denominator, as we said in the past, we think we're capital sufficient, and we'd like to continue to increase our capital return over the 2-year period that we talked about that.
But we're pretty confident, based upon our business mix, our presumed corporate tax rate, taking into account there's still a lot of questions around that, and where the global economic growth is that we will generate above 10%.
Again, it's going to be a function of activity levels and expenses related to deals, which is what's driving the biggest change, but sort of in that 40 basis points, which is about $400 million plus or minus both to the revenue and the expenses.
We got to -- a lot can happen in these markets, and I don't think we serve anybody well by just focusing on our margin.
And I think that's also going to lead to some of the growth momentum that we have in the margin and in the revenues.
So again, I think the betas are going to start to look a lot more like our expected modeled betas of about 50%.
I think -- what I was suggesting was, given what's going on in the business, the bottom end of that range, we think, is very doable and we should achieve it.
In my recollection, and maybe I'm wrong, but I think there's only one firm in the history of the Wealth Management business, and I'm aware of its size, that has generated margin above 28%.
That said, we put the range out there because that's what we think we will achieve over these 2 years.
It remains -- I don't think a lot is going to change in 2018.
And then, yes, if we got some serious change, we think, as an institution, we're over capitalized.
And frankly, on a global basis, I think there's a lot that would support that.
One, that there was a lot of operating leverage built into the system if it began to grow again, and then one that I think James made during the strategic presentation to the effect that -- and it sounded like you believe that, at this point, the wallet could expand, I guess, on normalization of vol or something.
I think what we're seeing in fixed -- what we said in Fixed Income was, if we couldn't generate on average and we fully expected we'd have quotas that wouldn't meet the average, in fact, fourth quarter didn't meet the average, but on average, $1 billion a quarter, we had a real open question about whether we've taken the right strategy when we downsized 25%, was it enough, was it too much, et cetera, et cetera.
On average, for two years now, for 8 quarters, we've generated $1.25 billion, I think, on average.
I think we have one quarter in there maybe a year ago where it's around $1.7 billion.
And we think that in an improving market, which again, early days, if you just look at the 10-year, if you look at rate expectations or [indiscernible], they've all picked up a little bit here.
We think that we are investing at the right level for our businesses, but we don't know that.
If we have good revenue growth and invest behind the business and still keep our efficiency rate under 73%, that would be a terrific outcome.
So just given the range of the 22% to 25%, just -- how are you guys thinking about all that drop to the bottom line versus reinvesting in the business and the employee base over time?
So again, I think people feel pretty good about the global growth picture, and we see significant client dialogues and engagement.
",44.48,0.78069806
morganstanley,q1,2018,"This activity combined with the rise in U.S. interest rates and changes in inflation expectations contributed to strong fixed income results.
Investment management again witnessed net long-term inflows over the quarter as the team continues to produce strong investment returns across both alternatives and public markets.
Global markets were active, our institutional securities businesses benefited from increased trading volumes and a return of healthy volatility across many asset classes, while wealth and investment management businesses delivered solid results weathering softer asset prices.
The increase was driven by a combination of higher compensation expenses and execution related costs associated with higher revenues and business volumes respectively.
Turning to underwriting, new issue market conditions were more challenged during periods in the quarter, despite doubts of heightened equity volatility, rising interest rates and wider credit spreads, results remain solid.
Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 4% sequentially to $518 million.
A combination of higher client balances and increased engagement generated a sequential rise in prime brokerage revenues.
And cash revenues also saw quarter-over-quarter increase benefiting from strong volumes globally particularly in Europe and Asia.
Fee-based assets continue to be a source of long-term organic growth for the business supported by both conversions from brokerage and net new asset flows into the firm.
Net fee-based asset flows of $18 billion were strong.
Asset management revenues were $2.5 billion.
Lower suite deposit balances also impacted NII as retail clients have continued to deploy cash into the market.
Retail engagement was strong in the quarter as investors actively repositioned portfolios and responded to market volatility.
Although we saw outflows in our liquidity business as clients manage their cash balance needs around the turn of the year, our long-term strategy saw continued positive flows.
Invested revenues were $77 million, down by 31% relative to last quarter, impacted by lower market performance in certain private equity related funds.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Nomura.
As a very comprehensive response, I will switch over to the business side specifically wealth management, itÂs certainly encouraging to see continued robust fee-based flows, improvement in pre-tax profitability probably the one area that maybe fell a bit short of our expectation was NII driven in part by slower loan growth.
The good news is that we still capture those assets when they go into advisory accounts and other transaction-related accounts, but it has brought down our sweep accounts and we have replaced those with higher cost deposits and you are seeing that on the net interest expense line item.
So yes, I mean again within fixed income there are lots of businesses macro and micro corporate trading commodities are within our FPG business, a larger percentage of that that line item over time will be coming from these lending activities.
ItÂs been a good risk return profile with healthy yields and very strong credit characteristics.
For the quarter, the combination of continued advisory growth supported by secular trends and the businesses scale driven operating leverage produced record pretax profit of $1.2 billion.
We have often said that wealth and investment management give us balance and our other businesses make up the engine that drives this going forward in more active markets.
In institutional securities alone, the dominance of equities, the strength of fixed income and the breadth of investment banking generated over $6 billion in revenue.
In investment banking, we have generated revenues of $1.5 billion, a 5% increase over a strong fourth quarter.
Our sales and trading businesses produced revenues of $4.4 billion, up 64% quarter-over-quarter, increased market activity, strong client engagement and more favorable bid offer spreads particularly during the first half of the quarter drove the improvement in results.
Turning to wealth management, revenues of $4.4 billion were down 1% quarter-over-quarter as continued growth in asset management was offset by the impact of mark-to-market un-deferred compensation planned investments.
So I was hoping to just unpack James some of your comments surrounding the recent proposed changes to capital regime, as we think about the capital constraints that you are looking to manage to longer term, historically you have been a bit more leverage constrained, we now have this enhanced SLR and SEB proposals that are out there and there are some expectation that risk based ratios could once again become a bit more binding.
Historically, you are right, our constraint has been our leverage ratio itÂs been Â I think are constrained on every tests going back and maybe not the first one, I canÂt remember exactly, but I am pretty sure.
I know you had spoken if some of the factors, including the migration of mortgage originations in-house, but how should we think about the outlook for loan growth in the coming year and maybe against the backdrop of rising funding cost, how does it inform your outlook for the NIM trajectory from here?
I think what we have talked about coming into the Â throughout last year as well as coming into this year was a couple of factors that we suggested would slowdown NII growth in this segment and thatÂs what we obviously saw this year or this quarter excuse me.
So, we will grow probably at a slower pace for the reasons you highlighted the transition and sort of rising rates, but we still think thatÂs healthy growth on a $70 billion portfolio.
Is some of this funding that you are doing for CDs being used to fund some of the institutional loan growth, whatÂs the plan for how long that would stay on the balance sheet and does this provide a pipeline for some DCM activity here in the coming quarters?
So, the follow-up would be then I would expect that at least what was certainly volatility supported some of the trading strength here this quarter, there is also some annuitized component to some of the revenue strength here in trading that sits on the balance sheet and another component which you might not have touched upon, so I want to try and get out it different way, is the CD or is the CD is being used to fund this and are those deposit costs being born in the NII line in wealth, but not necessarily getting the benefit of the NII and so itÂs just a geography issue, so we are all going to Â my focus on the wealth NII, but you really are generating economics this is not pulling through that line?
Just a question historically the whole industry, but Morgan Stanley specifically had big seasonality in the first quarter, I thought a chunk of that had to do with the physical commodities business which is no longer there, but putting aside that this was a more active first quarter in general, you talked about securitized products, you also talked about some structure transactions and commodities, I know itÂs an impossible question, but should we be expecting seasonality of the past given that the higher activity levels and those specific components this quarter?
And generally speaking though, if you look back over 5, 10 years of first quarter has generally been seasonally strong, particularly in ISG sales and trading and whether thatÂs just because people have new money to invest or they are repositioning for the year or the start of the measurement period in terms of their performance, but there generally has been real seasonality in sales and trading.
So, I think the range of this firm is kind of a worst case scenario without the market completely imploding around $7.5 billion a quarter.
So, thatÂs what we are playing for is the sort of balanced and then the speed obviously in a good market, the seasonally strong market, an active market, which we had in the first quarter slightly lower tax rate, slightly lower preferred that we have every other quarter, then you are going to be at the highest end of Â or towards the higher end of your ranges.
The other question I just wanted to pick up on that was something that Jonathan mentioned in his remarks was the concept of the bid offer which was up very strongly in the early part of the quarter, I guess across a wide range of products and I would just be interested in a little bit more color on what you saw, where you saw it and in terms of products and areas and to what extent should we think that this has probably normalized already?
Hi, this question might do on the category of no good deed goes unpunished, but you have the biggest gap between your return on equity and your targeted return on equity, so the fact that you are not raising estimates or targets yet, I guess it could be because itÂs seasonal or you donÂt extrapolate some results because of something you see or because you compete away the tax benefits or you just want to be super-safe especially after your first couple of years and CEO, James, you got started, but you missed a couple of targets and now you are exceeding them and you are exceeding them by wide margin, so why not increased target?
So, when we put in a target range, we donÂt anticipate firstly we would never change it after one quarter and you wouldnÂt expect us do it, so itÂs I think we called it a medium-term range, so I think about those for a couple of years.
Again, I think from the overall credit quality, there is a couple of components, one is obviously mix, a good portion of that or itÂs the vast majority of the wealth management loans, virtually all are secured in one way, shape or form whether that be via house or our bigger portfolios around the security-based lending where we have good LTVs and good data protections.
Jon, can you share with us your thoughts on you talked about the mortgage production and moving it in-house may have contributed to some of the slower growth, but I know itÂs early, but your clients tend to be obviously higher net worth type of clients.
As rates rise, we will also see presumably less runoff, but again we feel good about where we are in terms of the lending growth slower first quarter, but as expected.
Jon, you guys generated good operating leverage in the quarter, comp ratio lower, just on the non-comp side, we expected somewhat with just the activity, but maybe just some color on whatÂs being driven by activity versus what you guys mentioned on the investments in wealth management like what we should be expecting is more ongoing?
And then just as a follow-up on the capital ratios in the stress capital buffer, I just wanted to give or take given that it will be more variable or volatile going forward, do you expect some more transparency in the calculation of the test and if you get that then can you better manage like the current kind of portfolio in the business to maybe navigate that better over the next few years and I know itÂs early, butÂ?
Good morning, just a follow-up on that, you guys, James as you said you have built more stable you think stable kind of revenue producing business model you had when we look at the stress test, you get hit the hardest in terms of starting point to stress minimum in terms of loss rates that seems, it doesnÂt seem to jive with what you have built and just therefore you get hit hardest in this SEB even though you have plenty of capital.
Some of that this year is going to be a function as you know are of significant portion of our revenues in wealth comes from our fee-based flows and if your markets are down 65% and they donÂt ever recover, that obviously has an impact on our business.
On the wealth management side, just want to follow-up on the NII questions, I guess just to wrap it all up, how should we think about sequential quarter progress going forward, should we be thinking about growth for Q1 base and also if you have the deposit, the brokering deposit number for the quarter that would be helpful also?
Sure and again the way I would describe this first of all I think you have heard James talk a lot about this business being balanced, so itÂs not going to move quarter-over-quarter sequentially very much, thatÂs why we like it a lot, it sort of grinds it out.
Just had a quick question on the wealth management space, we saw that the reps were down 1% year-on-year, I mean going forward is that just the right way to think about your advisors in that business, there is going to be a declining based from here or will there be a some point we can actually see growth in advisors?
",35.28,0.6588649
morganstanley,q2,2018,"The segment generated a pre-tax margin of approximately 27%, while continuing to invest in the business.
Going forward, we expect to be able to continue to invest in our business and offer our shareholders an attractive capital return while maintaining a prudent capital base.
Year-to-date revenues were $21.7 billion, a firm record after excluding the impact of DVA in prior periods.
Continued strength across investment banking, equities and fixed income has contributed to year-to-date revenues of $11.8 billion, our strongest first half of the year excluding DVA since 2007 and a 19% increase versus the same period last year.
In investment banking, all products and regions performed well, generating revenues of $1.7 billion.
Revenues were $4.3 billion for the quarter as continued growth in asset management was offset by slowdown in transactional revenues.
Year-over-year, revenue has grown 13%, driven by continued strong investment performance and positive flows, particularly in our active fundamental equity and multi-asset strategies.
All of our businesses are positioned for growth and to support our clients if activity levels remain high.
How about -- on the net issues income front and wealth management, I think down sequentially for two quarters.
So, good growth year-over-year, which I think is a better metric to look at.
And we do expect to continue to grow NII in that sort of 4% to 5% range, which is where weÂve been growing it year-to-date.
Again, certainly in the wealth management channel, the new CD promotional rates and savings rates have been for new money, as you said and weÂve seen really good uptick on that.
So, weÂre going to continue to see this trend of a diversification away from the sweet deposits, which are lowest cost funding source into some of these more higher cost products, and thatÂs what really is going to drive interest expense going forward.
I think itÂs a little premature, I mean, not to duck the question, Guy. But weÂre still on the comment period.
And I think everybodyÂs kind of taken a little pause on that and trying to figure out what is the right level of capital you need in the financial system to fund the economic growth and whatÂs right leverage of the institutions.
So, I think, as I said in the opening comment, weÂre in the transition period.
The bottom line is where weÂre distributing I think thatÂs $6.8 billion of capital through the first six months of this year, I believe weÂve had earnings of $4.8 billion.
I guess, first question here just on the retention loans and wealth management where I think the balance was $3.6 billion at last quarter.
And IÂm just trying to kind of think about the moving part here because I know itÂs important to the kind of the forward margin story.
It sounds like itÂs across the business but just a little bit of more color there and just confluence of moving parts that you mentioned on trade retentions and Brexit.
We have risk weighted assets in fixed income of I think $380 billion; we had a balance sheet of $1.2 trillion; we had capital of $30 billion.
As to where weÂre making changes, obviously, the investment in technology and thank you for the comment about the tech expo the folks did is real.
ThatÂs not trivial; that is a real evolution within both, wealth management, the trading businesses that weÂre very focused on.
The potential for growing revenues in asset management given the diversification of the base, the range of products and the alternative space and the traditional space and the performance of that business is real.
The share gains that weÂre seeing across banking, equities and fixed income is real thatÂs happened last year, and itÂs happening again this year.
All of those things are real, and the bank and what weÂre doing with the deposit strategy and also respecting the questions that came earlier around net interest income, the bank will remain a very important source of growth over many years; and then, our geographic repositioning, particularly in Asia where weÂre investing stronger than we need to for example in the U.S. So, a huge amount going on.
So, if you had 80 years of change in the last eight years, I guess my follow up is your appetite for deals, your appetite to more aggressively reallocate capital to fewer areas, I think youÂve kind of answered that but -- or maybe tax spend, are you looking to ramp up, how much you spend on that?
But the most important thing is we just see a lot of growth across our businesses and a lot of our opportunity for share gain, and thatÂs what weÂre focused on.
Corporate lending is generally a relationship in the bank weÂve seen particularly on the commitment side, continued growth in that area.
But broadly speaking in the ISG business, weÂve seen good, attractive investment and growth opportunities.
But, itÂs not going to be a big area of growth and thatÂs not where we try to generate excess returns.
Just wanted to give your sense, when that starts to come on line, like what youÂre seeing and like what are the goals in terms of bringing in new clients, new assets, improving efficiency over time.
And although weÂve made significant investments and have that lot of technological change within the business, these trends are going to play out over a significant number of years.
And then probably more importantly, just how youÂre thinking about managing risk, because it does seem more consistent than a lot of the peers in the industry?
But I think our expectation is that there will be some changes here coming forward.
Number one, I think Jon hit on something very important that the sort of equities profile of the wealth management business is suggestive that itÂs more volatile than our actual business is because of the scope scale weÂve built in and the other sources of revenue.
I think, you said something like wealth management NII growth, you expected 4% to 5% kind of yearly growth.
So, is the right way to think about that youÂre going -- the capital ratios should be increasing over the year or irrespective of client activity?
And if there are opportunities to support clients and invest that capital into the business at a good return, weÂll do that.
TodayÂs presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
Investment banking and equities reported very strong results and fixed income continued to perform well.
Each year, the test has become increasingly more demanding and in fact has yielded results significantly more severe than what we and many other banks experienced during the 2008 global financial crisis.
Investment banking performed very well as new issue markets remained open and receptive to corporate strategic activity.
Equity sales and trading was buoyed by active global markets and fixed income benefitted from strong client flow.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.9 billion for the quarter, a 4% sequential increase, driven by higher professional services expenses.
The results represented 12% increase versus the strong first quarter.
New issue market conditions remained favorable in the quarter with significant investor demand across both equity and fixed income, supporting strong underwriting results.
Equity underwriting revenues of $541 million were up 29% sequentially as favorable backdrop allowed us to convert a strong IPO backlog and convertible activity also remained robust.
Fixed income underwriting results increased 4% sequentially to $540 million with stable results across both high-yield and investment grade issuance.
Whereas the effects of U.S. tax reform and rising rates have weighed on investment grade flow issuance, this has been more than offset by increased strategic financings.
Prime brokerage revenue saw sequential increase, aided by seasonal factors in Europe and stable client balances.
Fixed income continued to perform well with quarterly revenues of $1.4 billion.
Net fee-based flows remained strong at $15 billion, contributing to record fee-based assets of $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client assets.
Net interest income was $1 billion for the quarter, down 2% sequentially, driven primarily by lower prepayment amortization gains.
This increase was partially offset by outflows in the quarter, primarily driven by tax season and continued market deployment.
Whilst lending in the U.S. banks grew by 2% to $70 billion in the seasonally strong quarter as client choose their SBL lines to manage liquidity through the tax season, year-over-year, loans have grown approximately 8%.
A flatter yield curve has also shifted clients investing into shorter duration products at lower commission rates.
Our sources of annuitized revenues continue to grow with consistent fee-based flows and record balances for both fee-based assets and loans.
Additionally, we believe our investments to create a modern client and FA experience supported by integrated digital capabilities will enhance growth and further operating leverage over time.
Investment management witnessed another solid quarter with a continuation of positive long-term flows.
Our Basel III standardized common equity Tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios are expected to increase to 15.8 and 6.4% respectively as we accredited capital in the quarter.
Our first half results have been strong with two consecutive quarters with revenues greater than $10 billion.

And itÂs generally been redeployed mostly back into their investment accounts in both fixed income and equity.

morganstanley,q3,2018,"Investment banking benefited from continued strategic activity and new capital formation globally.
Wealth management delivered another solid quarter and investment management saw continued positive long term net flows although investment results were impacted by weaker emerging markets.
Investment banking reported revenues of $1.5 billion down 14% relative to the second quarter reflecting a normal seasonal slowdown in activity.
New issue market conditions remained favorable in the quarter supporting strong underwriting results.
Activity remained healthy across products and regions with particular strength in IPOs. Americas were strong throughout the quarter while Asia and Europe saw some seasonal slowdown in August before a strong September.
Increased results in investment grade issuance partially offset a slowdown in high yield financing relative to a very active second quarter.
Event driven transactions remain a significant driver supported by the active M&A backdrop and our ability to leverage our global franchise to provide holistic client solutions.
Fixed income revenues of $1.2 billion were down 15% versus the second quarter.
Total client assets of $2.5 trillion is up $85 billion or 4% compared to last quarter as markets showed gains and clients continued to add new money to their accounts.
Net fee-based flows also remained strong at $16 billion contributing to 3% growth in fee-based assets which now stand at $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client assets.
In addition to the traditional decline in retail engagement during the summer months, we saw clients continue to focus more of their fixed income investing into shorter duration products at lower commission rates.
Investment revenues were $40 million down 27% sequentially impacted by continued market volatility in FX and emerging market equity performance.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
There was a comment in your press release on institutional securities that the other sales and trading net losses were down quite a bit versus year-ago reflecting lower net funding costs and I was just wondering, I mean it was a big enough numbers that itÂs meaningful and it sounds like a great thing but how do you reconcile that with higher interest rates?
Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
The first half of the year was characterized by strong market environment and increased levels of client activity.
Year-to-date revenues of $16.7 billion are up 17% versus the same period last year benefiting from active global markets, increasing revenue pools and stable to improving wallet share.
Sequential revenues declined across each business line as the quarter was characterized by low market volumes and more subdued volatility compared to the first half of the year.
Year-to-date results demonstrate that we can steadily grow this business while continuing to make investments into tools to support asset growth, increase client engagement, and improve cost efficiencies.
In investment management, we saw continued positive long-term flows $3 billion in the quarter supported by strength in overseas distribution.
On a year-to-date basis, asset management revenues are up 13% on strong investment performance and positive flows particularly in our active fundamental equity strategies.
My first one is on deposits, they've been definitely in focus for the wealth management side and I know you gave some comments on that Jon, thanks for that, but we had the first wave I believe of CDs, your CD program that was scheduled to mature over the summer, so it would be great if you could maybe let us know what sort of customer behavior you've noticed with that money and what portion of that cash are you retaining and what kind of products are customers moving into with that cash?
We have seen a little bit more of a shift into the fixed income investing than we did probably what we saw in 2017, but all in all it has been sort of both a nice way to supplement liquidity in the bank, but also bring in new assets to the firm.
It sounds like itÂs off to a good start this quarter, but as you look at the stock it's obviously been under a lot of pressure this year and I think its concern over the sustainability of revenue.
This firm is positioned for resilience through cycles, thatÂs exactly what we demonstrated in this quarter, to deliver $9.9 billion of revenue in a summer quarter that was unheard of a couple of years ago.
But in a normal downtick in the market, yes we pick up some volatility and then over time our revenues would trail off a little bit, but the fundamentals are very strong.
And I think the other concern obviously is the capital deployment and the results from 2018 CCAR, but it seems like youÂre addressing that or trying to building capital, I donÂt know if that was simply the Â what's going on in the market or specifically response to the CCAR results if you could comment on that and then if there is still further optimization that you can do to the CET-1 after going up 90 bps this quarter?
But I canÂt imagine a scenario over the next several years where we donÂt have significant buyback programs just because we are accreting so much capital and weÂre Â and unless you can find ways to invest that in the business to generate those kinds of returns, I think it is shareholder friendly to have a strong dividend, have strong buyback and make the appropriate investments to build growth into the business.
In the fixed income space we have picked up share over the last several years since the restructuring which is why weÂre so confident that the position of the business is in such good shape.
We expect to continue to maintain and grow our share given the stability and the momentum in the franchise and itÂs always going to be a competitive market.
I guess as a quick followup, given the volatility that weÂre seeing in like the EM and Asian markets start 4Q, can you give us an update on what how this impacts your business maybe specifically in IM or itÂs like the investment line?
As I mentioned earlier the investment line was impacted this quarter because of some of the volatility in both the rates in emerging markets.
But I think again thatÂs the sort of the tail on the dog, the primary driver of revenue growth for us in that business is going to be around the fee-based assets and we continue to see continued good flows into our long-term assets.
So, yes I would say, I mean modestly I wouldnÂt there is not some massive jump likely across wealth and asset management in a flat market environment, but there is definitely operational improvements that can be made.
So I just wanted to start off with a question on equity market sensitivity and James it was interesting to hear your perspective on some of the factors weighing on the stock and maybe some of the underappreciated revenue stability.
I mean listen, we had a more challenging third quarter, both from market activity and just seasonal volumes and we delivered an ROE of 11.5% in that environment, so and tax adjusted that's probably [10% to 0.25%] [ph] for what it would have been last year.
So we're not as correlated to equity market movements as I think is sort of believed if you actually look at the stability of the franchise across each of the businesses.
I was just wondering from your perspective, how you think about balancing the need to continue to deliver margin improvement versus some of the higher investment needs as you look out to other growth opportunities?
I mean, there's obviously operating leverage in a business that has the scale that we've got across wealth management, across the prime [brokerage] [ph] space, the core large investment banking businesses the incremental dollar revenue is coming on at a much higher rate than the embedded dollar revenue across all of our businesses.
Under the current thinking around the SEB structure, our balance sheets would not grow, that obviously makes both intellectual and intuitive sense, and secondly I believe that the capital what you would be required to continue to distribute would be just dividends for one year.
If I could just maybe ask one thing unrelated to capital, just on the - I think there has been a lot of concern about NII growth from here, is your sense that at least could you update us on kind of the pick-up in yields in growing the loan book versus the securities portfolio as you kind of see that loan growth, should we expect and margin can continue to move a little higher?
I think the last quarter we mentioned that we saw NII growth in the 4% to 5% range for the year, we are still comfortable with that.
Remember a lot of the young clients don't have as much wealth as our older clients, so it's going to be a slow build, but we continue to make the investments in the digital strategies and the stock plan program to be able to position ourselves to bring in more assets over time.
And then just a followup here would be maybe good to get a little bit more perspective on just the investment banking activity levels in the various businesses and then clearly, some concern in the market just around kind of being late cycle.
That was really a function of just a lot of activity in the third quarter and we expect to continue to sort of rebuild those pipelines and be active in those markets.
We have seen a little bit of consolidation with MiFID going into places people to reduce the number of counterparties they deal with, but I think the general comment was generally the top providers, top three or top four or top five depending on the market where the products have generally been gaining share and we would expect that trend will continue.
",45.93,0.75687027
morganstanley,q4,2018,"Regarding Investment Management, it's fair to say we are positioning the business for growth, but it's still early days.
In the future, subject to regulatory approval, we expect to increase our capital return while simultaneously investing in our business for growth.
We believe that the stability of our team and business model compared to an industry, much of which is still going through change, should enable us to continue to take market share.
Shifting the page to Investment Management, as we noted last year, Investment Management is a business positioned for growth and we're executing on that opportunity as evidenced by strong growth in our asset management fees since we refocused our efforts on Investment Management in late 2015.
Within the year, we saw patches of over-performance as well as underperformance, obviously, in the fourth quarter.
Lastly, while not a point of growth, we reiterate that given our business mix and model and our capital base, we will look to achieve 100% payout ratio going forward, subject obviously, to regulatory approval and any acquisition opportunities that may come our way.
I'm going to now turn the call over to Jon, who will talk about the fourth quarter in detail, the annual results, and then, of course, we'll take your questions.
Our Institutional Securities business reported revenues of $3.8 billion in the quarter, a 22% sequential decline.
Sales and trading and underwriting results were both impacted by violent market swings at the end of the year.
Volatile market conditions, including the severity of intraday and intraweek movements, impacted performance in cash and derivatives in the fourth quarter.
Wealth Management finished a strong year on a weak note, impacted by the decline in asset prices and the impact of market volatility on investment banking revenues.
Over the last several years, the impacts from our employee deferred compensation plans have had limited impact on both revenues and pretax margin, but this quarter, losses on deferred compensation plan investments had an outsized impact of over 5% to the revenue line.
The growth in annual revenues and the limited increase to non-comp expenses while still investing in the platform highlight the business' extraordinary benefit of scale.
Higher asset levels at the end of the third quarter helped insulate these revenues against the market decline in the fourth quarter.
And on a full year basis, Asset Management revenues increased 9%, a function of higher fee-based client assets driven by markets and flows.
Given the number of factors that can distort any individual quarter, we continue to manage this business with a long-term lens.
Asset management fees of $628 million grew 4% versus the third quarter, driven by a significant amount of the year's performance fees being recognized in the fourth quarter.
The first question I wanted to ask was just -- I recognize that, in Wealth Management, there were some moving parts that had to do with two different deferred comp programs, one being the one that affects both the expense and the revenue lines equally, and we've seen that before.
It obviously brings up your comp expense and affects the -- and given that's an adjustment for the full year, the fact is hits in one quarter affects that quarter disproportionately.
And again, over a long period of time -- excuse me, over the annual basis, the deferred comp plans have generally been pretty -- have not really impacted the PBT, but we did obviously see a 14% decrease in the S&P in the quarter.
And within Wealth, based on the mix of how those employees invest their assets and the deferral schedules, you saw a bigger revenue impact there.
In any one quarter -- and I would -- as I mentioned in my script, if you take those as well as the seasonality as well as some of the volatility we saw in the Investment Banking or I guess, in the calendar revenue, which you can see in the supplement, the margin would have been closer to the full year margin, had those impacts not occurred.
So, we plan all of those, and if we can drop in a series of -- sort of string-of-pearl type acquisitions across the platform while we're driving organic growth in the actively managed, which is the higher margin business, get better scale in the fixed income platform and do this over a period of years and not look for a single answer but a series of answers, I think there's a lot of space in there.
You guys referred to this a couple of times, and James, I believe you referenced how you all made a change to the deferral schedule for comp a few years ago, which was also to bring in line with peers.
I think, Brennan, that's a fair question, but to be totally clear, I mean, the change we made several years ago was a big deal.
It's just something that given obviously the disappointing sort of sticker at a price numbers of some of this stuff; it affects things like the margin in Wealth Management because, as I said, $40 million, $45 million is a point of margin.
I certainly don't see it as the B, which is the Morgan Stanley of old, if you will, the sort of episodic volatile shifts, overdependence on propositions, big marks, misplaced trades, major integrations going on at the same time, selling businesses, writing stuff off.
The year averaged at about $1 billion in a quarter, but yes -- no, that was not a good result.
As we said, we put up $5 billion of revenue in each of the last three years in a shrinking market, so it's not the business of old.
As I said, we had good client activity, part of facilitating our market-making businesses standing in between flow.
And again, we think it's a real nice opportunity over the medium to longer term to bring in more clients and more assets into the business.
And then, I guess, specifically within the Institutional Securities, you've had really nice market share gain in the investment bank as well as across the trading businesses the past couple of years.
We make thousands of incremental business decisions that drive expenses every day, and yes, that is something we will be hyper focused on as we get through about the first half of this quarter and get a better sense of where we think things are really heading.
And then with that volatility, as we're entering 2019, it will be great to get a little bit of perspective around the dialogue with clients, either on the equity issuance side, where I think there's been some enthusiasm around potential for IPOs this year and then also on the M&A advisory side as well.
Since some of the volatile like line items -- when I think about the Institutional Business, like the other line that credit flows through, investment line that was negative and then even the deferred comp, was there anything in the fourth quarter that was more like realized losses versus mark to market that if the market continues to stabilize, we would expect some normalization there?
And we just want to continue to build-out and obviously, doing deals in wealth and asset management is a completely different ball of wax than doing them in trading businesses or in banking businesses.
So, I think going into the quarter, we felt very good with the book that we had or the exposures we had.
And we feel very good about sort of that book of business and being able to bring that to market, assuming these conditions continue to hold.
It probably outperformed our expectations a little bit although again our expectations was it wasn't going to have a material impact on the business.
Our clients like most products and we would expect to continue to grow them going forward.
By design, the increased contribution to firm-wide revenues from these sources should help support a base level of profitability during periods of extended market disruption.
Our existing strong footprint in Institutional Securities, coupled with our growth initiatives, will position us to capitalize on this expected regional growth and wealth creation, particularly as capital markets become a more important source of financing.
Scale advantages don't improve the story, resulting in a material increase in average sale in revenues over time.
Higher average daily revenues, supported by scale and the added benefit of U.S. tax reform, have improved the segment's contribution to the firm's net income.
Across our business lines, we're seeing strong investment performance while managing client partnerships and distribution and continued product innovation.
We will continue to focus on driving further operating leverage and increase expense management.
Namely, sharp losses to the investments associated with employee deferred compensation plans had a considerable impact on transactional revenues in Wealth Management.
Although these factors are not material to the annual results, adjustments can be amplified in any given quarter and impact the segments in slightly different ways.
Non-compensation expenses of $1.9 billion increased 8% versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by execution-related costs and seasonality.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion declined modestly from the prior quarter, consistent with lower industry volumes.
Advisory revenues increased 44% versus the third quarter.
Sequentially, equity and debt underwriting revenue saw declines, consistent with lower new issue volumes in both products.
Fixed income results for the quarter were weak against a challenging market backdrop.
Both seasonal factors and increased economic uncertainty related to growth and rate outlooks for 2019 and beyond influenced markets, resulting in rapid movements in spreads and asset prices.
Full year results highlight the business' operating leverage.
Asset Management revenues were unchanged versus the prior quarter.
Total client assets of $2.3 trillion in the fourth quarter decreased 8% sequentially, reflective of broader market movements.
Total U.S. Bank deposits of $187 billion increased 7% versus the third quarter, driven by higher deposit sweep balances.
Net interest income of $1.1 billion increased 2% versus the prior quarter and 4% over the full year.
Increased lending penetration, the adoption of digital tools, fee-based asset flows, and minimal attrition indicate an engaged financial adviser population and a business positioned to grow.
Investment Management reported revenues of $684 million, a 5% increase sequentially.
This increase was a result of the revenue recognition accounting rule change implemented early this year.
Other revenues were impacted by an impairment of a legacy, non-controlling interest in a third-party asset manager.
Although the asset pricing witnessed at the end of the year will have an impact on first quarter results, markets have settled into tighter ranges and historical relationships that broke down in the fourth quarter have realigned.
Our first question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.
And then maybe how you think about investing in that business versus say buying back stock at book value?
I heard all your comments on equities, but -- I know we won't get numbers, but in general, could we -- could you comment on like how much client deleveraging and lower volumes impacts things versus trying to stand up and facilitate for clients and just taking some hits along the way when the market is falling like a rock?
Part of reengaging is having products to buy, so new issue coming to market, the banking calendar being a positive.
Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.
Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Why don't I start on this and let Jon talk about how to think about the Institutional Business and expense management versus growth.
Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
I guess first question here just on Brexit and the uncertainty that's been increasing over there and just how we should think about either risks to Morgan Stanley around potentially personnel movements or maybe indirect, just related to kind of how you guys are thinking about the outlook for the institutional business given that uncertainty is pretty high right now.
Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.

morganstanley,q1,2019,"In the first quarter, our business has produced solid results and rebounded from the fourth quarter's market dislocation and idiosyncratic events.
Across the board, ROE, ROTCE, the firm efficiency ratio and Wealth Management margin are in line with or at the higher end of our strategic objectives, ensuring a very solid start of the year.
Institutional Securities generated revenues of $5.2 billion in the first quarter, a 35% sequential increase.
Non compensation expenses were $1.8 billion for the quarter, a 3% decline from the prior year.
In Investment Banking, we generated revenues of $1.2 billion, a 19% increase relative to the fourth quarter, after a slow start momentum and confidence picked up.
Strong non-compensation expense discipline and the benefit of the retention note roll-off more than offset the effect of lower asset values, resulting in a margin of 27.1%.
As we have mentioned before, as a result of the revenue recognition accounting rule implemented in 2018, a significant amount of any year's performance fees will be recognized in the fourth quarter with a small amount being recognized in this first quarter.
And again, we continue to see opportunities and levers if needed, in those sort of more controllable, if you will, line items like marketing and business development and professional services.
We did also see, as you would expect, year-over-year, a decline in some of the execution related expenses given the decline in revenues, but again, a nice quarter for us on the expense side, 71% efficiency ratio, well below our target of 73.
We also then saw over the course of the quarter, increasing build up of the pipeline in the IPO product.
I mean, the bottom line, the business has scale of point margin on $4.4 billion of revenues, $44 million.
And the first quarter was just shows the benefit of scale and our ability to pull levers and sort of manage between growth and investment.
Question on just what to expect, even though you can't expect too much, on fixed seasonality in the first quarter, I'm sure is as strong as ever been, you put a very good result.
And then on the flip side of that, in equity trading, I think public volumes are overall light, but my question is, what are you seeing on reengagement of PB client balances on margin?
As I mentioned in the call, a nice rebound from a disappointing fourth quarter and the business.
Sort of fit into capital, I mean, now that you've kind of taken a look at the new, the fast scenarios, how are you feeling relative to last year with respect to the CCAR submission?
I think you saw in January what we said is, and we continue to say we have sufficient capital, and we would like to return 100% of our earnings going forward.
So again, we feel very good about the mid single-digit guidance on loan growth and NII, even though, clearly, expectations around rates and the forward curve are different than when we started the beginning of the year.
And we -- as you saw what happened in those line items, the second one on other sales and trading you mentioned or just other?
But as James mentioned, this is really a scale business and we have the ability to really manage that expense base tightly.
Again, I'm not, that's obviously huge given just the size of the business, but that may make down some numbers around a little bit over the next couple of quarters.
And one of the real exciting things about the Solium deal is our ability to use those digital investments more broadly with this younger demographic and this sort of emerging investor, demographic, as people build wealth in the workplace.
I mean, it's a -- I think it's a very interesting strategic play that will play out over a number of years and puts us squarely in the space we want to be in, but at a small.
That is the main game, driving the margins in that business, shifting the assets on to new types of platforms, building out the banks and lending products.
I mean, I think, first and foremost, I would just say one of this has been less movement of people both in and out and that's good for stability of the platform, the ability to build relationships and continue to invest, so that's a positive.
And those three lines, other revenues, other sales and trading, investments, I think you have to look at the broadly in context and then we try to call out what we think the biggest drivers of the changes are.
We also saw that's where we have a lot of our hedging activity, and obviously, spreads tighten, so there were losses there on the flip side and the other revenue line.
Obviously, we're just looking at one quarter here, and you're optimistic on the revenue outlook.
On the ISG side, you saw the comp ratios sort of consistent with last year's first quarter.
We want to be competitive in compensation and retain and attract the best people and we think we have the flexibility to do that within the context of the of the comp ratio in that business.
But if again, comparing year-over-year, we've been investing in the business, and in terms of both people and comp levels.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
In our Institutional businesses, client participation and balances steadily improved alongside confidence and asset prices.
Our Wealth business absorbed lower fourth quarter asset levels and delivered strong results.
Broad client relationships have driven net inflows in our global equity strategies, where long-term performance continues to attract investors.
On a year-over-year basis, total non-interest expenses declined 4%, even as we continued our investments.
Consistent with our objective to investment growth, we announced our intent to acquire Solium Capital, a leading global software provider for equity administration, financial reporting and compliance.
Through Solium, we gained a new scalable channel and direct sales force getting us the ability to target another client population, particularly a younger demographic and its wealth accumulation phase.
On a combined basis, we will now have direct exposure over 2.5 million individuals by Solium's workplace services, complimenting the other three million wealth management clients, our financial advisors already served in our traditional business.
As all of you know Colm was the Chief Financial Officer during the global financial crisis and was critical in helping navigate the firm through those challenging times.
Clients took time to regain confidence, and industry volumes declined impacting our ISG businesses.
Lower asset values at the end of 4Q impacted Wealth Management and Investment Management fee revenues.
Revenues of $10.3 billion declined only 7% year-over-year compared against the strongest quarter in the firm's history ex-DVA.
We remained committed to funding investments to tight focus on our more controllable expenses such as marketing and business development and professional services.
Compensation expenses were $1.8 billion, resulting in compensation to net revenue ratio of 35%, consistent with last year's ratio.
We saw an increase in bond issuance volumes across investment-grade and high-yield, while our leveraged loan activity remained muted.
CEOs remain engaged the global equity pipeline has built through the quarter, particularly IPOs, and market volatility is subdued.
Revenues in 1Q were $1.7 billion, more than doubling weak fourth quarter results.
The market was generally characterized by tightening credit spreads, declining interest rates, low volatility and uneven client activity across business lines as well as benefits from structured client activity.
Tightening credit spreads and increased secondary trading activity resulted in higher client revenues.
We saw increased velocity over the balance sheet in the quarter Commodities had strong broad base results with solid trading performance and lower structured revenues in Q1 '18.
Despite lower starting asset levels, the business produced the PBT margin of 27.1% demonstrating resilience despite large market drawdowns in the fourth quarter.
Asset management revenues were $2.4 billion.
Net interest income growth of 3% to $1.1 billion was primarily driven by the benefit of the December rate increase and the corresponding impact on our investment portfolio yields.
Total expenses increased by 3% quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher carry compensation, which offset a decline in non-comp expenses.
Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets of $876 billion increased 3%, driven by client activity primarily in equity sales and trading and ISG lending.
Pipelines are healthy in Investment Banking, and higher asset levels will support fee-based revenues in our Wealth Management business.
James, I know you've referenced it and provided some high level context around how you're thinking about it strategically.
But maybe -- could you help us think about how you see this fitting in a bit more granularity in the different businesses?
I was just wondering if you could provide any inside into how much of that fee strength that we saw in Investment Management, transactional activity in Wealth and other sales and trading is sustainable.
We have a $17 billion revenue business in Wealth Management that has nothing to do with Solium right now.
As you know, most advisors now work in teams, and we've gotten a very good program in place to help them transition their book of business to a younger member of their team and continue to retain those assets, even though people are leaving the business or retiring.
It's a strategic question regarding your technology investment, especially given that you've already locked into acquisitions like Solium Capital.
",54.46,0.8397104
morganstanley,q2,2019,"Our year-to-date efficiency ratio of 71%, below the 73% target, reflects our commitment to managing expenses tightly given the risk to global growth.
While results do have the potential to be lumpy in this business, obviously, to put the growth in perspective, revenues over the last 12 months are up nearly $900 million since full-year 2016.
We continue to invest in the business, and looking forward to sharing more about Investment Management in the months ahead.
In addition to increasing our return of capital to shareholders, we were able to invest in the business and completed the acquisition of Solium in the second quarter.
Focus on our more controllable sources of spend, particularly marketing and business development and professional services continues to help self-fund our ongoing investments, including at the technology, workplace enhancements, and the integration of Solium.
Now, to the businesses, Institutional Securities generated revenues of $5.1 billion in the second quarter, a 2% sequential decrease.
In Investment Banking, we generated revenues of $1.5 billion, up 28% sequentially, with advisory, equity, and debt underwriting all improving versus the first quarter.
We now expect NII ex-prepayments in the third quarter to be largely in line with the third quarter of 2018 with potentially a more material impact in the fourth quarter if the forward curve is realized.
In terms of the actual deposits, remember there are three buckets that sort of impact NII which is really the mix of deposits, the rate profile, and then obviously the balance.
In terms of our deposits we saw about $10 billion of outflows in BDP, some from lager tax payments as we mentioned, some other just as people continue to look at their cash as an investment vehicle and they've seen some higher yielding alternatives, but they are still pretty defensive.
The one thing that we would say on the deposit side that was positive is that the replacement of those $10 billion of deposits, although at a higher rate, were primarily driven from our wealth channel, so we had a lot of demand for our different products as we continue to build out that product set.
We've seen post the tax payments, probably the last five or six weeks of stabilization in those deposit levels, but again customer behavior, the forward curve, what happens to rates and the competitive dynamic will drive ultimately that outcome, but I think we feel very good about the deposit products that we've been rolling out.
Another point that we had -- questions we had heard from investors on the back of the results were around the mark in Investment Management that seemed strong again this quarter.
And so the forward curve has sort of by July 30 basis points, but September I think around 50, and then almost three full cuts by the end of the year.
And what happens to actual betas will be, as I said, a function of really sort of the competitive environment, what alternative investments look like, and what not.
That's not GAAP, it's helpful for the fixed income business, if it improves people's view of the world that there were going to extend the economic expansion, and people want to press that view in the equity markets, it could obviously help in the PB activity levels, it could also lead to repositioning of portfolios, which we haven't really seen a lot of.
My second one, sort of bit of a nerdy accounting question here, but in the release, you kind of mentioned in other sales and trading, revenues increase due to a shift in funding mix and balance sheet composition, I also think in the Q.
And I know we've talked before that James, you can always take it higher, but there's a trade-off between investing for growth and making sure you have the revenues coming in over the next several years?
The reality is, Mike, as you know, the incremental dollar revenue in that business comes on with a much higher margin than 28% today.
So there's almost no way in which you can, if we are growing revenues, you're not going to grow that margin in the business unless you have some sort of, operating issue, et cetera.
In other words, if the stock market stays at this higher level what impact would that have on the pre-tax margin in the third quarter?
Again, we would expect given where the market closed the prior quarter that asset management fees are going to go up in the third quarter.
First question just on wealth management and customer engagement, the transaction activity has been muted even with markets at highs and that's normally not the case.
We are at all-time highs in some -- in the market levels, but I think as I mentioned earlier, there seems to be a lack of conviction around that in terms of both where is it going from here and given all the uncertainty around the rate profile as well as the growth profile, I think the retail investor is inundated with information every day.
And what we've seen in our portfolios is sort of a little bit of a defensive posture in the sense that there is a decent chunk of the investment assets in short dated fixed income securities more so than we've seen in the last couple of years.
And I know on this call and in June you had cited your ability to really support high levels of investment and wealth as you noted and the higher incremental margins that each additional revenue dollar that's coming through all, what that supports in terms of improved profitability.
I guess if I look back over the last five to six years a lot of the pre-tax margin expansion has been facilitated by stronger growth and higher margin NII.
And as we look to NII now becoming a headwind versus a tailwind, do you think beyond 2019 you can still hold the line on that 26% to 28% or does the pressure on the NII revenue source in particular impact your ability to really sustain that level of profitability?
So it's not what drives the numbers it's not just NII, we've had there are lot of moving parts in here more money going to annuitize the accounts, the average velocity on those accounts, I think is about 20 basis points higher than the transaction accounts and that's for both fixed income and equity accounts.
So that is the guidance on the third quarter and as you know mortgage prepayments is going to be impacted by the rates in sort of the five to 10 year shape of the curve and so I just gave you guidance ex-prepay if that those numbers go down dramatically, you'll see the prepayments hurt us and if they go up you'll see a reversal of the prepayment.
And right now it's just some of that's just really a function of whether the assets in each of those accounts are growing faster or slower because the composition of those two buckets are little bit different brokerage versus fee based, but we do still think that that number will increase over time.
Maybe just a quick follow-up on the equity front, I hear that you are number one in maintaining share, but in PB I think you mentioned something -- or actually ask the question of are client balances also muted just because market keep hitting high?
Yes, again I think any given quarter is just a very short timeframe to look at, but I would say our PB business is obviously is very healthy and very strong.
I mean -- well, we have clearly seen lower levels of leverage finance activity which is a higher margin business.
In investment grade, it's a little bit lower but still pretty healthy, but yes, sort of the chunkier, higher margin stuff is really going to be sort of the delta if you will in those numbers.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ materially.
Despite the challenging environment, Institutional Securities' results were solid, with aggregate revenues over $5 billion.
Our Equity Underwriting franchise performed well, and continued to bring new companies to markets.
Higher asset levels and strong loan balance growth more than offset the effects of lower interest rates.
Investment Management had very strong second quarter results.
Moreover, increased net long-term inflows should aid asset management fees going forward.
Despite lower completed M&A industry volumes, advisory revenues increased 25% quarter-over-quarter to $506 million.
Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 3% sequentially to $420 million despite lower industry issuance volumes in investment-grade bonds and leveraged loans.
This represents a decline of 34% from a seasonally strong one quarter which had significant structured activity compared to a more challenging backdrop this quarter and limited structure activity revenues.
While credit complex results declined sequentially, they were strong by historical standards driven by securitized products performance.
Commodity revenues declined quarter over quarter on lower trading results.
Asset management revenues were $2.5 million.
Total bank lending ended the quarter at $74 billion, increasing $3 billion from 1Q on strong growth in SPLs and continued progress in mortgages.
Other revenues were $120 million, increasing 48% sequentially as a result of realized gains from our investment portfolio.
Investment revenues of $247 million were driven by continued strong performance across our private funds including in our private equity Asia, real estate, and infrastructure businesses.
Market-related growth and positive net flows across all of our asset classes drove the higher long-term AUM.
Asset management fees of $612 million were essentially flat to the first quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets rose to $892 million as we continue to support our clients.
Wealth Management's fee-based revenue should benefit from higher asset levels, and investment management remains focused on growth and delivering increased value to clients.
",48.98,0.78140205
morganstanley,q3,2019,"Fee-based client assets and lending balances continue to build in wealth management, contributing to a 28% margin.
A $2.6 trillion of assets annualizing over $17 billion in revenues and margins at historic highs, the business is clearly stabilized in the firm.
This segment made $5 billion in revenues and for the fifth time out of the last seven quarters, and it underscores the strength of our client franchise in all three lines of the business, investment banking, fixed income and equities.
Overall, we remain cautious today as trade talks swirl and interest rate paths continue to be debated, but expect us to look beyond the next few months and focus on continuing to enhance the stability of the franchise and growing the business.
All of that said, I donÂt want to take away from the strength of the quarter and IÂll now turn it over to Jon to discuss the results in greater detail.
As we continue to invest in technology, workplace enhancements and the integration of Solium, we remain focused on controlling more discretionary expenses, particularly marketing and business development and professional services.
The business produced a PBT margin of 28.4%, while continuing to absorb expenses related to technology investments and the Solium integration.
As we look ahead, weÂre cognizant of the seasonal patterns of the fourth quarter, but we are encouraged by client engagement and activity levels and are off to a good start.
What sort of confidence do you have that revenues will grow faster than expenses, if not just for the quarter, but for the next year and how are you thinking about that relationship?
And youÂre right, in any given quarter obviously, youÂre going to see bumps and bounces a little bit.
And while we are having to -- and wanting to spend on some of the new technologies that are obviously coming to the market, weÂre also taking costs out from what has been a legacy system that hasnÂt been terribly efficient over the last 20 years.
So, I think, IÂm not going to give you an expense ratio number now.
And as you point out Brennan, I think,, the commission activity of buying and selling stocks and bonds in our wealth management business is a very small percentage of that business, and obviously, half of that for the whole Firm, given that itÂs less than -- itÂs about 40% of the firm wealth management.
I mean, at the level, the clients are paying, I think itÂs in the mid 70 basis points, Jon will correct me for advice on dollars of assets.
And in terms of the economics and how we think about this business, it was really to get access to a younger and different client base.
I think, IÂve argued for a long time publicly and privately that a simple leverage ratio is a constraint when itÂs not looking at what is the intrinsic quality, and liquidity of the asset on the balance sheet does not make sense, levering illiquid security versus a treasury.
And we think that youÂll continue to see consolidation of share in that business, and thatÂs an opportunity for us.
We were pleased with the flows and we continue to think that weÂre very-focused on attracting both new assets, and weÂre continuing to see that secular trend of people wanting to convert their accounts into the fee-based format because of the services provided and the value proposition.
When we look at the global market, weÂve grown share over the last couple of years and itÂs stabilized over the last year or two in sort of the 21% share type numbers.
WeÂre not going to see the lockstep jump that weÂve seen historically, but there are share consolidation going on, particularly in the cash market.
And I think the build out of the wealth management which is -- was clearly part of that strategy, build out of asset management of strategy and the stabilizing revenues within the institutional business as weÂve gone away from the prop trading and the more volatile parts of the fixed income franchise.
And, I think for 4Q, given that weÂve already had two rate cuts last quarter, the benefits of the higher loan growth -- or excuse me, the higher loan balances as well stabilization of the BDP will be more than offset by where rates are, in terms of the absolute level.
If NII is moving lower, how should we think about, I guess, the comp ratio in wealth management, all else equal, just given kind of the positive comp dynamics that creates?
WeÂre clearly trying to grow assets, both in the investment management and the wealth management business.
Institutional Securities revenues were $5 billion with solid performance across all divisions, despite a mixed trading backdrop and investment management, assets under management surpassed $0.5 trillion as strong performance continues to attract positive long-term net flows.
Further expansion of our services across the wealth spectrum from the highest end family offices to employees service through Morgan Stanley at Work provides us with the potential $4 trillion asset opportunity, also international opportunities, particularly Asia and continued growth of our loan portfolios are among the exciting opportunities that remain in this business.
Finally, our asset management business is well-positioned in the most attractive growth segments in the public and private markets with our leading active equity strategies and significant alternatives and solutions platforms.
One ongoing challenge of our continued pursuit of higher ROE performance has been the amount of equity weÂre required to hold, despite how weÂve repositioned the firm to benefit from the more stable revenue streams.
Despite a mixed market backdrop, revenues of $5 billion were the highest for a third quarter excluding DVA in 10 years.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.9 billion for the quarter, increasing 5% sequentially on higher volume-related costs driven by increased client activity.
In the context of fluid markets including trade and political uncertainty, economic growth concerns and central bank responses, we remain focused on serving our clients, while actively managing our risk.
Investment banking revenues were $1.5 billion, increasing 4% sequentially.
While equity underwriting saw a sequential decline, it was more than offset by the strength and share gains in our debt capital markets business.
Fixed income underwriting increased 39% sequentially to $584 million on the strength across both investment grade and leveraged loan issuance.
Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased 26% sequentially to $1.4 billion, driven by the strength in the credit complex.
Sequential results benefited from increased client activity, including structured transactions.
Commodities revenues improved quarter-over-quarter driven by North American Power and Gas. Investments declined $212 million sequentially.
Asset management revenues were $2.6 billion, up 4% quarter-over-quarter, benefiting from the improved asset levels we saw at prior quarterÂs end.
Seasonally slower client activity, a weaker equity calendar and negative movements in our deferred compensation plan investments impacted results.
The business saw a strong and broad-based positive net flows and assets under management surpassed $0.5 trillion.
Our equity strategies continue to deliver strong investment performance, driving net inflows.
Asset management fees of $664 million increased 8% sequentially.
Total spot assets rose to $903 billion, driven by increased client activity which also drove growth in RWAs. As a result, our common equity Tier 1 ratio declined to 16.2%.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.
You are certainly making progress over time with the ROTCE 13%, but youÂre doing that when you look at year-over-year where expenses grew faster than revenues.
Do you think that might impact a little bit of the potential returns on that investment or was this part of the scenario planning that you guys undertook when you made the acquisition that eventually commissions would head in this direction and competitive pressure would take you there?
And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
I think, fee-based asset flows of $16 billion were pretty strong relative to what we saw at one of your competitors.
And our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research.
We donÂt really look at it that way, because obviously, Christian, as you know very different types of businesses within it, whether itÂs for a $300 million family office, somebody liquidating a large concentrated position or the average investor selling a $1 million of stock or $100,000 of stock or whatever.

morganstanley,q4,2019,"The goal continues to be to shift our business further, emphasizing more durable sources of revenue within institutional securities and from wealth and investment management.
Over the last five years, we have increased the profitability of our wealth management business while still making investments in the U.S. banks and our modern wealth platform.
With combined revenues of approximately $21 billion our wealth and investment management businesses are among the largest platforms in the world and now we have an untapped opportunity to further scale our wealth management channel through our workplace offering.
The significant investments we make in the digital space, the acquisition of Solium position us to efficiently service the mass [indiscernible] population and capture new clients and assets through the workplace.
To-date nearly 40% of those plans on the legacy Morgan Stanley system have been transitioned to Shareworks and the remainder will be accomplished by year end 2020 and by the end of Â21 individual employees of our corporate clients will gain access to financial coaching, exclusive educational content and our self-directed brokerage offering providing them with an introduction to our wealth management services.
Over the next five to seven years we expect to convert over 1 million employee participants to either wealth management digital or advisory channels adding to the more than 3 million client relationships we have today.
The asset management sector is both very large and extremely fragmented lending itself to opportunities for growth in areas where we believe we can deliver differentiated value to our clients and to me one of the most exciting things we've done to capture this opportunity is product innovation illustrated by the number of new products we've developed.
We look forward to the transition to the new capital regime and expect Morgan Stanley will be able to return excess capital to shareholders while continuing to invest for future growth.
On wealth management we're making numerous investments across all of our platforms to enhance the digitalization of our firm and overall technological capabilities given our scale and other efficiencies.
Our institutional securities business reported revenues of $5.1 billion marking the best fourth quarter in over 10 years.
We reported fourth quarter revenues of $4.6 billion and pre-tax profit of $1.2 billion resulting in a PBT margin for the quarter of 25.4% Strong revenues were offset by higher seasonal expenses as well as a $37 million severance charge which had an 80 basis point impact on the margin.
We run the business based upon a myriad of things that we see from global economic growth to market share we have in each of our businesses to the capital we're using to prosecute our earnings in those businesses, our ability to drive efficiencies across the group, net of investments that we're making and we're currently running an ROTCE around 13% and so the two-year objectives feel like there's no compelling reason why we'd go below that.
In any individual quarter of course these things bounce around as you've seen in numbers over many, many years but over that time period we think the 13 to 15 is a very reasonable expectation and assuming normal market condition we would deliver on that.
For the longer-term aspirations really speaking the way we see embedded scale we have in our various businesses what the longer-term growth projections looks like our ability to manage our expenses you will see non-comp year-over-year are essentially flat this year which [immensely] itÂs pretty impressive given that we are investing in lot of parts of the business.
Many many years ago when our wealth management margins were around 10% or 11%, we set a target of 15% and I said publicly, I thought I could get 20% and obviously we exceeded that and the whole transformation business helped on that.
Many years ago we set our ROE target of 10% when I think our ROE was around 2% or 4% and we were constantly asked on this call when are you going to get there like, the kids in the back seat in the car saying when are we going to get there, when are we going to get there and we kind of got there and our feeling now is there's no compelling reason with normal economic growth and good discipline around expense management and the embedded scale in their businesses and the strength of the culture why these return shouldn't be achievable over a longer term period.
Could you talk a little about the market and revenue assumptions embedded within that target and at this point you guys seemed to have implied generally, especially with your comments just a minute ago James that about non-comp, flattening out here in 2019, we should be expecting self-funding of an investment and a more stability in the non-comp as opposed to the growth of prior years.
I can't guarantee where the first quarter is going to be, the second quarter, third quarter but over a full year where [27.2] with normal economic growth what we've done with the business I think that 28% I've been disappointed if we know that that I just put that out there.
So just I appreciate the comment and we continue to give further thought to that but we do give a reasonable amount of disclosure in the [indiscernible] around that we try to highlight it to you when it's a meaningful contributor based on meaningful swings in the marketplace across all the businesses as I said before the PBT impact is not material generally speaking a dollar revenue versus a dollar of comp expense.
Obviously, the potential for the different dynamics around the size of that client i.e. was whether it's mass affluent versus ultra high-net-worth or high net-worth will have an impact, the asset levels and cash levels and net new assets but again incrementally if we think we can bring on another million customers in five to seven years on top of our current existing base, it's why we're so excited about the opportunity.
Slide 7 through 11 highlight what you expect institutional security, the five-year share gain should continue, wealth management increase clients share by one-third, of the over longer time frame and that's management have new products you have digital initiatives non-comps flat.
I think I'm not sure we've ever had a call when you haven't asked for higher targets and it had to feel defensive when we're talking about wealth management margins above 28% efficiencies at 70% plus and ROTCE at 13% to 15%.
That's sort of it's fun and it's interesting and it's sort of saying what could we deliver aspirationally and that's probably where your head is in the longer term part of that chart the right hand side but in terms of running the business and in terms of thinking to our capital deployment and dividend strategy, compensation all of our investments that we're making we really focus frankly on the two-year objectives and what I've always tried to do with these target is set a range where the bottom of the range is what we should be able to deliver in all normal circumstances.
I get the share gained from the European banks but your expectation for that to continue and then on the wealth management side going to the mass affluent, you're going down market to the teeth of the Schwab's zero commission for wealth and after a number of years of kind of moving back from the lower end clients.
Normal market environment growth that obviously translates into higher revenues and we think there's some upside on share.
On the going down market I think about differently and for sure commission pricing has been going to zero in small trades for a long time and there have been examples of that in the digital space for years.
I realize you don't want to give all the details on the expense of adjustments related the deferred comp but I guess I'm trying to get a sense of the kind of full-year efficiency ratio of 73 as I think about kind of getting the 70-72.
The last time we publicly set a comp ratio goal for ISG I think was in 2015 which was 37% and we've managed in the last three or four years to be under that, sometimes 34%.
We grew revenues by 20% while we managed the expenses tightly, doubled net income and materially increased capital return.
This more fulsome suite of products allows us to deliver services to an even larger base of employees and this will help ensure that our touch points are not limited to stock plan participants.
We've already seen significant contribution from these products generating $19 billion of incremental assets under management and almost $500 million of incremental revenue in 2019 versus 2016.
These strategies continued new product launches and investments in our client franchise more broadly will be a very important component of future growth.
In addition to new private alternative product launches noted on the prior page we're seeing strong organic growth in our existing high-performing private funds.
For example, our infrastructure number 3 fund which closed in the fourth quarter is over 50% larger than infrastructure 2 raising $5.5 billion of institutional capital versus $3.6 billion respectively.
Our alpha products across both private and public markets as well as our world-class global solutions capabilities will be critical contributors to investment management's revenue growth.
Our public active equity strategies has strong performance and global client footprint has driven robust net flows.
In the fourth quarter severance expenses of $172 million related to a December employee action and intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $158 million largely offset each other.
Non-compensation expenses were essentially flat to 2018 at $11.3 billion demonstrating our ability to self fund incremental costs related to absorbing and integrating Solium and increased technology investments through continued discipline over our more controllable expenses particularly marketing and business development and professional services.
Prime brokerage performed well as client activity rose during the quarter with equity markets trending higher and derivative revenues declined sequentially as lower volatility weighed on results.
We continue to invest in our secured lending businesses which perform well and witnessed increased client interest from commercial real estate products.
Macro results declined versus the third quarter due to lower client activity.
Asset management revenues were essentially flat versus the prior quarter.
On a full year basis asset management revenues were also flat as a large market decline in Q4 2018 impacted first quarter results.
Total clients assets of $2.7 trillion increased 5% sequentially and 17% versus the prior year reflective of broader market movements.
Performance fees for the quarter were driven by strong results in our core real estate strategy and management fees increased on higher average AUM.
This line is primarily driven by carried interest which is earned from clients who are invested in private funds.
We entered 2020 with asset levels at new highs, healthy pipelines, constructive markets, engaged clients and a right sized expense base.

morganstanley,q1,2020,"We've benefitted in this period from robust business planning and from years of investment in our technology infrastructure.
I will now turn the call over to Jon to discuss the results of the first quarter in greater detail, our perspectives on the outlook given the current environment, and then take it back where weÂll both answer your questions.
Our business mix and strategy, which emphasizes more durable sources of revenues, supported our results during the recent market disruption.
During this period, the firm extended credit and intermediated trading, responding to client needs and supporting open and functioning markets.
Fixed income sales and trading produced revenues of $2.2 billion, increasing 73% from the prior quarter.
The combined impact was approximately $500 million to revenues and 150 basis points to margin.
Given the S&P index declined 20% in the first quarter, the negative revenue impact was elevated.
Higher asset levels at the beginning of the first two months of the quarter helped insulate these revenues from the subsequent market decline in March.
Our smallest portfolio, the $14 billion tailor book is also performing well with just a handful of special mentioned loans.
The benefits of higher lending and the $31 billion increase in BDP balances were more than offset by lower interest rates and the resulting higher projected moorage prepayments.
Investment Management reported revenues of $692 million in the first quarter.
We had extensive engagement with our global clients throughout the quarter and the business continues to see strong net flows, despite the challenging environment.
The second half of the year remains uncertain and the path of the economy will be driven by the time it takes to resolve the health crisis and the impact of the unprecedented fiscal and monetary response.
And you're going to take them whether it's in the margin book, whether it's in the asset management portfolios, whether it's in the trading businesses and how did all of that look.
And for this fund, weÂve come through that and generated $9.5 billion of revenue, and that's net of the deferred compensation plans, which actually puts us a bit over of $10 billion in revenue, effectively flat to a year ago.
I know, coming into the second quarter, weÂll have less market volume, we have lower interest rates, we have lower asset prices at the moment.
I think, our BDP, which is our cheapest source of deposits, which currently have a cost of 1 basis point is now about 65% of the portfolio.
And I think, our deposit costs at the end of the quarter were about 56 or 57 basis points, and those should come down a little bit as we've just repriced our savings product down in light of the rate environment.
We increased for the quarter to bring our reserve level on funded loans up to 1.7 there.
I really appreciate that, Jon. So, another question and my follow-up, you committed, James, that there is not going to be any risk this year, which you can appreciate the idea that this would reassure your employees in extremely challenging time.
I think, our non-comps will be lower through the year and get back to sort of reasonable levels.
So, I wanted to start the question on the loan loss provision.
When we got to the end of the quarter, in light of what was -- what we were seeing in the rapidly changing sort of economic outlook, which at this point I would say, and James has mentioned it a couple of times.
And we looked at the downgrades, we looked at what loans we thought would be downgraded, the stress draw scenarios, we did some loss given default sensitivities, we looked at criticized asset trends, and we factored all of that into our analysis that ultimately led to the $350 million reserve build on the entire portfolio or a 74% increase from our day one CECL.
Our retail and wealth business had very little reserve build, given the performance in that portfolio in the Company.
You spoke of some of the risks to the target that you laid out at the start of the year, certainly not surprising given the world, using some of your words, is anything but normal.
And I wouldn't describe the -- some of the losses that we took in the derivatives -- trading businesses related to the degrossing that we saw going on.
As you obviously saw during the quarter, there were significant volatility in certain indices and indexes, there were historical relationships that totally broke down, and went in different directions.
As James said, you're going to take and businesses where you trade and put with your clients the potential to take losses.
It's not really a linear relationship, but I would say, we have -- our equity clients and many of the hedge funds and quants actually performed reasonably well in this environment despite the volatility, we have seen some of the gross balances rebound from the lows that we saw in the end of March.
And obviously the higher market levels helps to gross balances.
I know, we got to deal with lower rates and lower asset levels going down.
Guys, we're going to take just one more question I think, because we're running -- we've run over time and we've given you long answers.
Jon, can you share with us, I think, you've mentioned that coming out at the end of the quarter in Wealth Management, 23% of your customers assets were in cash.
That's a great question in terms of how our retail clients are going to reengage with the market.
Over 90% of our employees are currently working from home as we continue to serve our clients globally.
The quarter was divided in two distinct periods: January and February were characterized by buoyant risk assets, rising markets, and engaged clients; March proved to be unprecedented.
With market function and liquidity essentially restored, clients are weighing the major factors at play, including significant unemployment and economic disruption versus monetary and fiscal actions larger than any others in history.
We tightly managed professional services spend and saw declines in marketing business development, given the global shutdown.
Robust results in sales and trading were offset by markdowns on held for sale loans increased loan loss provision, and lower levels of investment banking activity.
Non-compensation expenses increased 14%, driven by higher BC&E and transaction taxes on elevated sales and trading volumes and an ACL on unfunded commitments of $115 million.
This was partially offset by an increase in accelerated primary offerings and secondary activity as we held clients across the global monetize equity stakes.
Equity sales and trading is number one globally and revenues increased 26% sequentially to $2.4 billion with strong performance across all business lines and particular strength in Asia.
Cash results were robust, reflecting the nearly 50% increase in global market volumes compared to the prior year.
Derivative revenues increased sequentially as we facilitated client needs during periods of severe market dislocation.
In late March, we reached a recent low in balances as market levels declined and we saw clients significantly degross.
Strong commodity results were supported by increased client activity, driven by meaningful swings in energy and metal prices.
Looking across other sales and trading and other revenues, three main factors drove approximately $1.1 billion of losses embedded in these two lines.
While changes in compensation expense related to these investments will generally be offset by changes in revenue, there can be some timing differences due to vesting schedules in a given period.
Client activity was extremely strong, reflecting high levels of engagement throughout the quarter as clients repositioned portfolios and moved into cash and other short-term securities.
Asset management revenues increased slightly from the prior quarter.
Total client assets of $2.4 trillion declined 11% sequentially, largely on market depreciation.
We had fee-based flows of $18 billion and generated strong net new assets at a pace above our historical run rate, highlighting the stability and health of this business.
Total net flows of $57 billion benefitted from a significant new long-term client partnership and our liquidity business.
Total spot assets rose to $948 billion as we deployed our balance sheet to support clients during this challenging period and retail clients saw safety, increasing our deposits by $45 billion.
The increase in RWAs was driven primarily by increased client trading activity and market volatility as well as lending.
Our client-driven model combined with strong capital and liquidity will help deliver relative earnings strength in this uncertain environment.
But, there are several factors that will impact our earnings power in the near term, including lower asset values and balances, interest rates near zero as well as volatility and economic uncertainty impacting capital markets and M&A volumes.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous.
I mean, if you'd said three months ago that 90% of our employees will be working from home and the firm would be functioning fine, I'd say that is a test I'm not prepared to take because the downside of being wrong on that is massive.
Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
We saw a lot of incremental net new assets into the Firm, periods of volatility like this generally we see in our client base look for professional advice.
Yes. Because it's a conservative business to people who are clients of ours who we know what their asset and liquidity picture is.
Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
At Morgan Stanley, my hope is we'd be able to test people to make sure that they're healthy and clean and we bring people back in the staggered way as soon as the government lets us do that.
