Tim. we have done for the half of fiscal 2015, we are reporting another record today. for the June quarter was $49.6 billion, an of $12.2 or 33% over year. Our growth was driven by the tremendous performance iPhone, the introduction of Apple and the continued strength Mac and Store. these great results the context of a challenging foreign exchange environment around the world and reduction in 1 million units across product growth performance more. As Tim mentioned, our results were especially impressive in Greater China, where revenue more than doubled year over year over $13 billion. Emerging markets overall 79% to almost $18 billion and represented 35% of our total company revenue. Company gross margin was 39.7%, better than expectations, mainly due strong iPhone sales.

We're up over in Greater China and in India, and increased more than 45% in several countries including Italy, Spain, the and Turkey. mix iPhone 6 and 6 Plus led to an iPhone ASP of $660, an of year over despite the significant negative foreign exchange impact I referred to earlier. We reduced iPhone channel inventory by about 600,000 units during quarter, which left at low end of target range of 5 to 7 weeks of channel. As we have done for several in a row, we continued to gain significant market share based IDC's latest of a 12% global PC contraction. Mac growth driven by portables and we delighted with the strong customer reception of new MacBook. We ended the quarter slightly below our 4 to 5 target range for Mac channel. We sold million compared to 13.3 million in the year-ago. iPad sell-through was 11.2 million as we channel inventory by 300,000 units. ChangeWave measured a 97% customer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2 and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, over half plan. the purchase intent was even stronger at over 70%. We participate in the low of the tablet but we are successful where we do. indicated that iPad has 76% of the US market for priced above $200. We're very excited about the advances in the iPad experience in iOS 9 in the fall, including the slide over view features retail multitasking, picture-in-picture for FaceTime and video, enhanced QuickType composing text faster. In the near future, United plans to introduce apps to transform the customer experience and improve integration with operations. IBM released 13 new MobileFirst for iOS apps in the June quarter, including new apps in retail banking and healthcare, well as new horizontal apps for HR and sales. There are now apps in IBM's MobileFirst for iOS catalog that connect to big data and analytics right on their iPhones. total of 100 apps to be available by the end 2015. In April, Apple, IBM and Japan Post announced a joint initiative to deliver iPads with IBM developed apps and analytics to connect citizens with services, healthcare, community and family. Since announcing this initiative less than three months ago, we've already seen strong interest from other looking for innovative ways to support aging population. Importantly, we also continue to work closely with leading business software and solution providers to help businesses of all sizes transform work with iPhone. They're developing new and differentiated solutions on iOS across many industries, and attracting very significant customer interest. We generated over $5 billion in revenue, a new all-time record, and an of 12% over last year thanks primarily to strong growth from. The revenue the App Store increased 24% and the number transacting customers grew 19%, also an all-time record. growth was particularly strong in China, where the Store revenue more than doubled year over year. developers have 250,000 apps our China App Store the response from our customers has been tremendous. revenue from other products grew sharply, up 49% over last year. The contribution from Apple Watch accounted well over 100% of the of the and more decline of iPod and accessory sales. As said in the past, we do not plan disclose Apple Watch metrics because we don't intend to insight that could help our competitors. Our retail and online stores very busy quarter, with customer up 49% year-over-year, driven especially the strong interest in Apple. our very popular Apple Store app, mobile to our online during the quarter equaled desktop traffic for the time ever. We opened three new stores, second store in Brazil, our store in Manhattan, and twenty-second store in Greater. brought us to global store count of 456, of which are outside and we are track to have by. We ended the quarter with $202.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase $9.3. the June quarter, issued a total $10 billion of term debt, consisting of $8 billion US dollar denominated notes and ¥250 billion denominated notes as diversify global debt base. This us with billion of term debt outstanding at the end the quarter. During quarter, we turned over $13 to our investors. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $4 billion repurchase 31.2 million Apple shares to open market. We have continued to execute our capital return program a fast pace now an over $126 billion of our $200 billion program, $90 billion in. we move into the September quarter, I'd like to review our which the of forward-looking information that Nancy referred at the beginning the call. We expect to be between $49 billion and $51 billion compared to in the year-ago. the year year iPhone growth was very the sequential unit decline the June quarter was worse than the past years. you that was, and in particular, why drain channel inventory when so well?. Katy, it's Tim. the channel inventory did go down by 600,000. in this particular quarter, we were to basically right the bottom end our range and we view that as good thing, not a bad thing. Obviously been much higher if we would have expanded channel, but if don't need to that, that's not how we think about business. In of what's going on with iPhone, 35% growth is almost three times the market. And if you at it at a little narrower regional level, Western Europe grew 30% versus a market so times market. And India we grew at 93% this is on of the China numbers that we've covered that the quarter a of 5%. well I think in way that you at it. So Tim, just to extend the longer term, as sure you're you're lapping some pretty significant comps as it relates to the upgrades that you're about as as significant in. What is framework that you use to convince yourselves that units can continue over longer term?. you Katy, we purposely just give guidance for current and we've that. And obviously of numbers that we have growth in the revenue that iPhone would have stellar quarter. we're that this quarter is going to be great. the future looks, it one quarter at a time. look at the first time iPhone buyers and seeing very numbers in countries that you would want to see those in, like China and Russia Brazil and so. also see a market that over a five-year horizon, if you look the IDC numbers, is projected to from 1.3 in 2014 over 1.9 billion – billion, rather,. I everybody's to a smartphone, and I think we've proven that we compete for a fair of those, as you can from our. Could you walk us through the key behind your margin range for September and particular how we should think about sequential ForEx impact this and the impact a product cost?. So we got into 38.5% to 39.5%, and just keep in mind last year in Q4, our gross. So this year we're expecting a sequential decline of 220 basis points. First of to your around foreign exchange, it to be challenging environment given the of the US. In our case, the impact after is going to be about 30 points Q4. And could you give us a more color on the dynamics for iPhone in the quarter and how this compares prior and your expectations?. to be an upward bias helping the as mentioned, but could give us bit more detail what exactly you're seeing here?. I think it's interesting in the context of towards emerging obviously. And I think we talked about it prior calls, 6 Plus is doing well in markets that you expect, Greater other markets. markets where our growth rates are particularly strong and 6 Plus, because of the screen is doing extremely well. you a little bit about gross margins in the question. But could you talk about we think the trends in gross margin?. other words is, should the margin trends we've seen in cycles continue into next year?. a follow-up or another question for Tim here, is that the has lot and some may wanted a little more. Okay Gene, let me with gross margin. As Tim before, obviously to the current quarter. example, currency can be very different one year to the next. We know that next year is going represent an given where dollar has. may be different from one year to the other. There are things remain relatively similar as we launch new products. We make better all the time, and that typically requires cost and so structures of our products, new tend to higher than the products that they. Having that, as you know we've got a very, very good track record those over lifecycle of the products. the one thing that to point again as get into the following year, is course currency be an issue. Secondly provide a more color, sales of the Watch exceed expectations and did so despite still trailing demand at the end of. And to you a little insight, through the end the quarter, in fact the Apple sell-through was higher the comparable periods of the iPhone the original. And we were able that having only 680 points sale. as you know, as I had reviewed earlier, the sales were so great at the beginning, we not able to our until mid-June. And those points of sale much, the overwhelming majority of the low numbers sales were not until the last two weeks quarter. I look all these things, we feel really great how we did. Beyond the very good on sales, we're excited about how the is positioned for the long term because we're starting a category. bring native apps which going to be killer to the Watch. Based on that experience, we're now to channel holiday we're convinced that the Watch going to one of the of the holiday season. And so I back up and look at and I feel fantastic what team has done and and I never go without and it's not because I'm the Apple. your remarks you talked a little about your market share of in the above $200 78%. you think about the iPhone and your market in the category, how you think about it?. wondering Tim Luca, you could talk about how think about market share, where play that your ASP is comfortably above $600?. What do you think your market is above or in smartphones?. And do we think that, that share going forward?. Toni, it's Tim. at it a bit differently than you. at it as job is to grow our products regardless of the that need convince in some people to from price to the. we think if do great job with the product that people will be willing spend more because they much more of it. And I can look the results the iPhone and that action. I'm in part because you about the highest ever Android switcher. strength and the dramatically above market growth because you're taking share in that high-end category and far along there?. can point to proof points you've actually expanded the size of the market for products of price point?. Oh, think there's no if you at it we expanding the market size in areas. that there's some people that are switching from comparable price points to the iPhone, and that's great too. And then if I just ask you to how you think about cycles the iPhone 6 cycle. replacement cycles over the they similar what you saw one two years ago when you about replacement?. of things that also sort of struck me was I having repurchase intention of versus competitors at 50%. there's a of plans people began signing up for in last year that could. They may one leases that could actually help the upgrade. you look many of your products have been absolutely fantastic and at different phases in their life, seen tremendous high growth, whether it's iPad, iPod, and iPhone looks like challenging here next quarters. this even more strategic focus into broadening the reliance on a couple products such as mentioned Apple Radio. There's a lot content on the Apple Watch and apps and then also Apple Pay. you increasingly focusing on hiring and kind of non hardware (45:32)?. Jim, it's Tim. think the phone has a lot of legs to it. I the early innings of it, not in the innings, I think the rate of growth over the long will also be. In terms of the other things that we're doing, have some great capability and teams in Apple. at the aggregate level, we still remain focused because if look at size versus number of projects we have going, much smaller to most. that you didn't mention, the Mac continues very well. there's some incredible productivity enhancements coming in with view and slide over and picture-in-picture. and I believe that the iPad upgrade cycle eventually occur because as we look at the usage iPad, remains. I look geographically, where we've been doing really good the emerging our still high in any of them, and so there's lot of there as as there in most developed as. Thanks, Jim. Tim, there's some concern what's going on in China with the stock market and economically. Yeah, it's a very good question, and we remain extremely on China and we're continuing invest. Nothing happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be largest market some point in the future. It's as you point out, equity markets recently been volatile. But it in I think is important, despite that volatility in the up 90% the last year, and they're up 20% and so kind of think all us would love. And think generally this has been, at least as we see maybe not true for other businesses, this worry probably overstated. had talked about before, we're continuing to expand the indirect channel well. and I think this a major point many people miss, China is only 12%. think that really to an future there. China is a fantastic with an incredible unprecedented of opportunity there. it seems like you're really focused on market share gain right now. In other the way that we win to people to buy their first smartphone. In other the way that we win is get to upgrade their current iPhone. very focused iPhone around the world, not in one geography and getting message out through ads is one way to do. be 800 basis points this quarter the 33% we've reported it wasn't the movement in currencies. And when you look around the world, it's really if exclude China, essentially every currency has against the dollar. are pretty careful thoughtful about where we increase prices and when and by how during mid-cycle because not something that we particularly like to. Look, in long run a strong US dollar is not a positive for international business. It has been remarkable so far to that we did take prices in a few markets. But really remarkable see how iPhone sales have been, because have increased, in of these increases, we've sales and increased market share in all our geographies the world, exception. then can you talk bit about linearity during the quarter a geographic basis?. Somewhat back to China question, I did see it down toward end of the quarter?. it's Tim. Maybe the way to talk is sort of at the level. And so the had a more a kind of a skewing. if you look the – it sounds like you're honing in the Greater results themselves. There is no impact from the quarter in the Greater China numbers. A replay of today's call will be for two as a podcast the iTunes store, as webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.",58.66,0.71560717

The revenue the App Store increased 25% and the number transacting customers grew 18%, also an all-time record. particularly impressive in China, where Apple App Store revenue grew by 127% year-over-year. The momentum behind the App Store in China has been tremendous with huge interest from and customers alike. developer in China has grown dramatically in the last with over 1 million members in our program. Revenue from other products grew strongly up 61% over last year, thanks to the growing contribution from Apple Watch. We expanded Apple Watch distribution significantly over the course of the it was at almost locations in 32 countries at quarter. Our retail and online stores had a very busy quarter. fiscal 2016, we to open or replace 40 and stores and we continue to place particular emphasis on China where we of next year. Customers have been interested in the iPhone upgrade offered in our U.S. retail stores. iPhone upgrade program gives customer a connected device an easy convenient way to get a new phone every year with low monthly payments to a third lender along with the security and protection of AppleCare Plus. After making 12 or more installment payments, customers can upgrade to a new. First, relative to the iPhone upgrade program that I just mentioned, we will be reducing revenue at time of sale the cost associated the program and of revenue software non software services each iPhone sold. Second, in September based on an of market offerings we reduced the estimated selling price of software upgrade rights and non software services that we defer for each iOS and sold, the reduction is and $10 unit.

We very active in the market during the and returned $17 billion to our. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $14 billion to almost 122 million Apple shares through open market. we move into December quarter, I like to review our outlook which the of looking information that referred to at the beginning the call. We expect revenue be between $75.5 and $77.5 billion compared year ago. In light of December quarter guidance, firmly low single digit revenue what looks increasingly tough heading into the March how do you get comfortable that Apple isn’t on the verge of [ex] [ph] growth for the first time in a. that iPhone will grow in Q1 and we base on we are seeing from we recorded highest on record for Android switches last quarter at. also look at the number of people that upgraded, that were in the installed base prior to 6 and 6. if I out and look at China, before and just make the once again is enormous change in China over the several years. study I have seen Mackenzie indicates if you look back five China’s middle class had about 50 people in it. look five years, it will ten times that number it. -- and I like are reasonably well positioned China, I’m sure we can do better, but think we doing fairly there. It’s - my view is that of a transitional of thing we invest for the long term, invest Apple’s. a new record again last quarter and the growth seems to be really great there. I’m really with the early of Apple Music the people moving from the free to the music. Just as a follow-up on growth, if you look at services companies, Amazon, they're all growing over 20% and it's largely driven activity of Apple users on. Do you feel like there is more that Apple can to participate in that services growth or to that tied to device cycles?. App is over 20%, it grew 25% last and so we very good that. I also out that some of these upgrade are in the market, they of to look more like a business of the way they. Tim, you just touched on as reducing the upgrades, but how you think about the iPhone cycle the next few years, obviously the from carrier’s in the program. And then lastly, you mentioned some of accounting related the upgrade program. And that, if you look at we that it would have a positive in replacement cycles. We do like the that it creates a market an iPhone at price point well is a better product customer currently buying which would further help an ecosystem point of that's to be. seems like that from a rollout point of view -- will see these plans offered in significant way in the States already, plans are offered in some derivation in over countries in the. we put it all is something has more measurable impact on business two, three quarters down road, the right to think about it?. think about it being – there were some clearly that were offered prior to cycle. I think the investor concern is that Q1 will benefit at least on year over year basis from weeks of in. so I the concern is December is a structurally quarter in the sense of from of those on basis. But if look out beyond December, wouldn't that point notably lower seasonal growth than March quarter. And how we think about the factors unit the December quarter?. do that the sort of the macro things that I about earlier, the programs, the Android rate, the iPhone in the markets and the in these these trends one quarter. And just on the follow-up, the reported gains from currency hedging in fiscal year 2015 were significant, billion contribution the company. And this is not an Apple's specific issue, Luca as you pointed out several times, but how do of currency hedges effectively rolling off and with hedges that are have less of an impact. we think that impact the P&L on a go forward basis, perhaps starting with Q1, but qualitatively directionally the course the year?. think my conclusion is that the that we're providing for the 39% to actually an level of guidance the that dealing. In some cases have realign prices particularly when launch new products. the first as you know not guiding and so we'll over the course of the year. on the enterprise business, $25 billion I you said, it was up year-over-year. product point of view, we'd actually been continuing to change and improve IOS for some. And so I do not envision Apple's having enterprise sales force will certainly make – we continue some people more on the engineering side, but I envision having a large force. you look China, we from an iPhone point of view, China, we 87% the market for. the number one selling smartphone in Mainland, China last quarter and number three. That said, I don't think it’s growing as fast as but I Apple's results are largely dependent minor than growth. I mean, you really tell the difference, if look at sort of our daily weekly numbers. I was very impressed with the the developers I week of the in stores are enthusiastically. We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS Steve Milunovich Tim, I to talk about two sources of selling to current customers and selling to new customers. terms selling to current customers you indicated about a of base is moved to the sixth. as people talk that been a upgrade cycle and is the six has have incrementally, not that a bigger number, I would would be bigger than that. And then on the other side in terms of new customers, just wanted number, are saying that 30% of iPhone shipments in the went to switchers IOS. do that you could actually have more new customers to Apple fiscal than you fiscal 2015. What this is that for customers to an last quarter and replace the that 30% of those an device. so what that and that is the largest that we've ever since we measuring it years ago. In terms of versus 2015 new customers, it's hard to. I it I believe that the upgrade plans that are out there I've mentioned it me on the. that's not something that we're going see this quarter next quarter, but it seems it’s going happen a year for now so. for the customer because many of them want to upgrade on basis and they can this very, very simply. add a lot people to the ecosystem and if you in the emerging markets, like, nobody is asking about iPad on. But if you look at iPad as just an example, in 68% of purchased an iPad was first tablet they've and have never owned Apple product. And keep in we have a good history of of people buy one have a great experience. Simona, we've made a of price changes during the course of. What we've in a normal of these markets, we've seen that iPhone sales have very and that shown our rates. recently we've adjusted some prices around world for launch of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. increase the world, it's normal to see some impact on sales rates, so we were encouraged the response. And so you look at China as an example, over 50% of bought 6 Plus were their first iPhone. I guess, first could you talk about the gross margin dynamic as go from September to the midpoint on 20 basis. I think the last five years that's only happen once the gross margin is going down fiscal. Can you just about what the dynamic what area the headwinds that you think that gross margins being done December?. On the other hand, of course we launching a lot of new products. We have a very good track record to reduce those but every time we a new product that is a headwind at the beginning of the for gross. just your statement on iPhone growth in fiscal is that. at iPhone 6 today, and add iPhone 6 and compare that to year’s 5s we are doing better, at that price point than we previously. And that is something that we would always -- sort of in our mind that one day from a point view we would like to as possible for the customer. But there are many plans and search what buy, that they to come in for several times love to have automated and working with our service providers. A replay of today's call will be for two as a podcast the iTunes store, as webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.",56.22,0.82074666

Our record revenue and continued strong operating performance led to an all-time record quarterly net income of $18.4. We sold million iPhones the December quarter, an all-time. million iPhones is an incredible number and it speaks to both the immense popularity iPhone and the execution of our teams to massive number devices such period of. Major markets, including Brazil, Russia, Japan, Canada, Southeast Asia, Australia, Turkey and the eurozone, been impacted by slowing economic growth, falling commodity prices and weakening currencies. 66% Apple's revenue is now generated outside the United States, foreign currency have a very meaningful impact on. $100 of non-U.S. dollar revenue Q4 of 2014 translated to $85 last quarter to weakening currencies in. Page two of our supplemental material illustrates our Q1 and growth rates in constant currency. The 8% rate I spoke about earlier translates to $80.8 billion in constant currency billion than our reported revenue. summer, while many were experiencing weakness in their China-based results, we the with incredible for iPhone, Mac and the App Store, in particular. In the December quarter, despite the turbulent environment, we produced our best results ever in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% last 47% sequentially, 17% year-over-year in currency. These great results were fueled by our highest quarterly sales and record App Store performance. Notwithstanding these record results, we began to see some signs of economic softness in Greater this month, notably in Hong Kong. Beyond the volatility, we very about the long-term potential the China market the large opportunities of us and we maintaining our plans. Despite economic challenges all over the world, Apple remains strong. We a greater of switchers from Android iPhone than ever in Q1, and we are very optimistic about business over. Innovation has always been the reason behind our and we remain committed making the best the world expanding the Apple experience change our lives in and more meaningful ways. In some of the most important products Apple's history were born as a investing through the downturn. We've also seen these times as opportunities to invest in new markets, just we're doing now in areas such other emerging markets. We launched the Apple TV its own App Store, the foundation for the of. We had best quarter by far for Apple TV and the number of apps developed for Apple TV growing. We distribution of Apple Watch to almost 12,000 locations in 48 countries during the. As we expected, set a new quarterly record for Apple Watch sales, with especially strong sales in month December. launched Pay in Canada and Australia with American Express and announced plans to bring this amazingly convenient, and secure mobile payment experience Kong, Spain and in the coming. second half of we saw a significant acceleration in usage, with a growth 10 times higher the first half of year. There are over 5 contactless payment ready locations in the Pay live today it's soon to accepted at thousands of and Mobil branded stations across the U.S. via Speedpass+ app. Finally, also shared the incredible Apple Music experience with even more listeners, with over million paying less than four months since customers paying for service. during a period of economic uncertainty, we believe is important to a portion of Apple's revenue recurs over. For example, recent consumer surveys by 451 Research, formerly as ChangeWave, measured an incredible 99% customer satisfaction rate for iPhone 6S 6S Plus an equally impressive 97% rate for the iPad Air 2. addition, a portion of our revenue is driven by our existing. Because our customers are very satisfied and engaged, spend a lot of time on devices and purchase apps, content, and services. to buy other Apple products or replace the one that they. as result, our install base has been growing very fast and has reached a milestone, crossing 1 billion active for the first. Because our install base has grown quickly, we have also an acceleration the growth our large and important source of revenues. we have reached this of billion active devices, we felt this would be information what has become one of the service businesses the world. So now, I'd to turn the call to Luca, who provide more insight into how our platform has grown, followed details on our record quarterly results. Each quarter, we report results for our Services category, which includes from iTunes, the App AppleCare, iCloud, Pay, licensing, and other items. Today, we like to highlight the major growth in this category, which we have summarized page three of material. The vast majority of the services we provide to our for instance, apps, movies and TV shows, are tied to our base of rather to current quarter sales. For some of these services, such content, we recognize revenue based on transaction value. For the services, such as the App Store, we share portion of the value of transaction with the app and only revenue on the that keep. To fully comprehend the scale of the that we are delivering to our installed base and fast this growing, we at purchases addition to revenue. When we aggregate the purchase value of tied to our installed base fiscal 2015, it adds up to than billion. recent December quarter, purchases installed base services reached $8.9 billion, which is a growth rate of year-over-year. size and growth of these services tied to our installed compare favorably to other services companies you're familiar with. Our installed services are also quite profitable, with gross on a purchase value basis, are to our company average. we're excited the scale and growth our active installed base, we indicate on page four. installed base has recently past 1 billion devices with year-over-year growth of more than 25%. We have tremendously satisfied and loyal who are engaged with our services at a fast growing. Let me now turn the details our record breaking quarter. Tim said, revenue was $75.9 billion, increase of billion or 2% year-over-year. Our growth was by all-time record sales, all-time record revenue from services, expanded availability of Apple Watch, and the successful launch of the Apple. We this record revenue despite a very large negative impact from the of foreign currency and constant currency; our revenue growth was. We once again achieved very results in Greater China, with growing 14% year-over-year and 47% sequentially to an record of $18.4. Emerging performance was strong overall, up 11% company for the quarter. Company gross margin was 40.1%, up sequentially and better than expectations, mainly due to favorable commodity and product mix. Operating margin was 31.9% of revenue net income was $18.4 billion, a all-time record. Diluted earnings per share $3.28, a 7% year-over-year increase over our previous all-time and cash flow from operations at $27.5 billion. We sold 74.8 million iPhones in the quarter, an increase 300,000 to last December quarter's sensational. iPhone ASP was $691 compared to $687 in the year ago quarter, spite of a very unfavorable exchange impact. We continue to see strong interest in iPhone not only with consumers also with business. Among corporate buyers planning to smartphones in the March quarter, Research found that 79% planned to purchase. We started the quarter below our channel inventory target range and to an extremely manufacturing ramp; we able to exit slightly above the low of our target range of five to weeks of channel. We continued our long running trend of IDC's latest estimate of an global market contraction, and we were especially happy with 27% year-over-year Mac sales growth Mainland. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week range for channel. Turning to iPad, we sold 16.1 million, compared million in year quarter, and we exited quarter within our five to seven-week target range iPad channel. from NPD indicates that iPad 85% share of the U.S. for tablets priced above $200. IBM released 48 new IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps in the quarter and there 100 apps in the MobileFirst for iOS catalog for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Our engineering teams are on track to deliver exciting new capabilities that create a fast lane for iOS business users by optimizing Cisco networks for iOS devices and apps, integrate iPhone with enterprise environments and provide unique collaboration iPhone and. We are also to grow our mobility partner. One great example our progress in the enterprise is Eli Lilly, who boosted sales by 15,000 based personnel the world with. A leader in mobile technology, Lilly has laptops in the field is upgrading its U.S. field sales teams to iPad Pro. Turning to services, we generated almost billion in revenue, including $548 million we received from patent infringement. Excluding that amount, our services revenue was $5.5 billion, a new all-time record and an of 15% over last year, thanks in part to growth from apps. Revenue from App Store increased 27% and the number of customers grew 18%, also setting all-time record. Among our who purchased apps content from our iTunes stores, the amount spent customer reached an all-time high in the quarter. Revenue from other products grew strongly, up over last year, to the growing as well as the successful of the new Apple TV, both of which established new all-time quarterly records. We expanded Apple distribution significantly over the course the quarter we experienced strong results during the holiday buying. We ended the quarter with $215.7 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase $10.1. We over $9 billion to investors during the. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $3 billion repurchase 26 million Apple shares through open market. As we have done in past, plan to provide an on our return program when report second quarter results April. move ahead the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, includes types forward-looking information that Nancy referred to the beginning of call. We are providing a range for revenue usual for the quarter of the volatility we seeing in the economy and in the financial and. We believe these are strong margins in light of headwinds we face from foreign exchange and the loss of. know, we provide guidance beyond the current quarter it's difficult for to economic and foreign exchange factors; however, at this point, we believe quarter the most difficult compare relative to the of year. Just terms of your March quarter guidance, does imply a decline at the midpoint. currency, you at it for the quarter, would be between 5% and 10%. So, we looking at a 400 basis point impact from quarter. lapping, of course, a strong year quarter -- just remind you growth year ago was up 27%, there's a number of things. you think about all the -- particularly the commodity-driven economies, Brazil and Russia and markets, but also Canada, Australia in developed economy is weaker than a ago. One of the things that done to respond to foreign exchange been to increase price of some in international. That has the effect protecting our which you've seen have very strong, both the December quarter and the that we provide the March quarter. Tim, could talk a little about the iPhone upgrade and the theme of iPhone a subscription?. particular, you believe that could have a measurable on quarter we anniversary this?. And I guess follow-up question would be I know you can't talk about new but level thoughts on virtual theme. On first question I think most important Gene, as you know for will be the product and experience. terms of the upgrade program itself, I think over it will be as customers get a different pattern. I appreciate macro comments as it relates to guidance, but can you talk a about how you're thinking might react from ASP perspective?. We couldn't happier with level of ASP that generated in the December. We had great for the iPhones that we at the end of. at the during the quarter, it very, very strong. On the question around channel inventory, we the quarter, the December -- we mentioned it back October our range of five to weeks. We have a bit inventory during the course of the December. quarter also on iPad and Mac well within the ranges that want to have. And given the slowdown you started to in December, are you still comfortable that level investment growth?. Then we've got data centers and data centers is a growing expenditure for because, as mentioned in prepared remarks, installed base of customers devices is growing, and is growing significantly. the center capacity that we put place is provide the services are tied to the base. And then around facilities, you probably that we are nearing new campus here and so is the year where got our peak in terms of capital. To start, just on iPhones, it looks like your guidance implies about 15% to 20% decline in Q2, unless you really see a change in decline year-over-year fiscal 2016. And like you to address that question, because the obvious follow-up questions are that you market won't grow because Apple be reaching in the market?. Is that because Apple's year and is decelerating this year and that's why we'll see a decline units?. Or is there something about Apple's ability to share in a where the market is moving lower points?. and Tim, maybe you're best to answer it, you address what appears to a in iPhone units and how we put context how think that, given some around switchers that highlighted. Toni, do think that iPhone units will decline in quarter. that they will decline to the that you're talking. We believe the toughest compare because of the year ago also had catch up from. I mean can you speak to of the points around your expectation market or whether you your replacement has changed whether your ability to has. so as I look sort of your -- maybe your umbrella point about on the metrics I see strongly suggest otherwise. For example, half of the iPhones that we sold in China last quarter to people were buying their first iPhone. Luca you had talked about channel it was 18.4 million for iPhone quarter. I'm not sure if misheard think said total installed base grew 25% year-over-year. There is a of our services business that is not related to installed base and more to when we sell a. A example would an Apple agreement that at the time the sale of the device. And then we showing that on that portion installed base driven services is a is related to -- where we recognize transaction value. And there are like for example, App Store sales, where a of the transaction does not get recognized by but it to the developer. you at it from a purchase value standpoint, in the quarter, grew 24%, and for the we at 23%. of the installed base, yes, it was over. To the around the inventory for iPhone, we grew channel inventory by million units during the of the quarter. Luca, you gross margins 39% to 39.5% in your guidance and hedging. can you clarify if within the gross margin this quarter that had the IP contribution, as well?. Yes, it was in the margins and it was worth points in the that we reported Q1. From an FX the negative on a sequential basis from the December is 50 points. of course, I would say by the largest impact on margins for the quarter the loss leverage, because part of our seasonal gets by a favorable commodity environment we've seen for a of quarters. said you want to invest while there's great opportunity in and of that. And how should we think about it, you're running billion a quarter?. In terms of SG&A, we obviously seek throttle expenditures in SG&A to business with the exception where we're investing new stores for example, our expansion China have not changed. in markets where we believe they are great places for for long-term, like India, as an example. And finally, in the markets where today, grandly, it looks bleak, from Russia and Brazil and some of the other that are much to our oil-based economies. are strong enough to continue investing we it's in Apple's best long-term interest do. think this is exactly that you want to invest and so confidently. Tim, could you talk a little about the next leg of in China?. I think there's billion mobile subscribers there, almost the size of. LTE penetration as the end of last October, which the data I've was in the mid-20s. And we this provides us a great opportunity to win over some of customers the ecosystem. have 28 in Greater China and we're on to have 40 in the summertime. It's the largest smartphone market in world, behind China and the States. And so see the demographics there also being incredibly great for a consumer brand people that really want best products. You a the macroeconomic weakness on units, but is some of last year accelerated this year kind of normalizing, kind a in terms of the unit growth you see in that. In terms of your initial question about is there some of issue are that ran out to and 6 Plus sort of accelerated?. However, think you tell from numbers that Luca is talking about on currency side and that's thinking the affect that increases can sometimes on business over period time, clear that the piece large. As far the question, Tim, I wanted to get a from you in terms what is the overarching message of more here around services. this really to just reinforce the power of the franchise Apple in terms of really navigate tougher macro times in terms the revenue, or is a stepping to much in of i.e. think of the stuff do on the data center side. started breaking out services, you know, the beginning of fiscal year. Can you a little more about what you're seeing in terms of in-store at the Stores?. Are seeing any sort of dislocation terms of are moving to the upgrade finance program, are they moving toward Apple maybe the in-store percentage used to related carriers?. In other are folks going Apple instead of carriers, when buy their phone, as part of these upgrade programs?. This has to do with wanting to provide customers a very simple way to upgrade. serve a significant number customers in the Apple Store the iPhone when new and when comes out, so we've designed a that made it and easy to that. I have idea over time how the percentage of the sales will vary between carriers the Apple store, but that's not our overriding. for Tim and a detail follow-up for Luca. With the slowdown in the macro FX and also GDP revision, strategy go-to-market still at or is there a need to go to more a middle market or lower price to attract customers?. Just it seems like growing installed base and services, as pointed out, really economically could help out Apple the long-term. And assume it's all this quarter it, it's all gross margin, and then don't cause that to reoccur again forward. And -- for the smartphone market, that we are able to though several different points for customers. And Jim, the patent question, yes, obviously item that the December quarter. To your around was included in the guidance, the probability of the amount incorporated in of the range.

Today we're reporting results of very challenging quarter, and we're also an to capital return program. Revenue for quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance range. We saw currency weakness in the vast majority of our international. currency, our declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the decline of 13%. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow strongly. We added a huge number of switchers and new-to-Mac customers, we generated strong growth. sold million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of own but lower than the year-ago quarter when we saw acceleration in upgrades and 40% sales growth over the previous. provide additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models; customers who switch from Android and other operating systems; and customers who purchase a smartphone for first time. As we look each of these three of iPhone sales, we see a business that is healthy strong. A recent Kantar survey of U.S. smartphone purchasers indicated a 95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any. Second, we continue to see a very high level of customers switching to from and other systems. And third, with only 42% smartphone penetration of the global handset market today, is still attracting millions of smartphone buyers each quarter, from emerging markets. example, in India our iPhone were up from a year ago.

App Store revenue was up 35% to beat quarter's all-time record. And Apple Music continues to grow in popularity, with over 13 million paying subscribers today. We feel really great about the early of first subscription business, our Music revenue has now hit an inflection after many of. business is powered by our huge installed base of active devices, which 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on call in those 1 billion-plus active are a source of recurring that is growing independent the unit shipments report every months. In fact, purchase value services tied to installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the quarter, up 27% over from 24% growth rate we reported in December quarter. The reach of Apple Pay also continues to following a very successful launch China in the March last week's rollout in Singapore. Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than five times volume of a year ago and 1 million new per week. Turning to the Mac, we met our sell-in expectations in addition to channel by about 100,000 units. Overall, the Mac continues to attract a large percentage of customers. latest survey of major markets, over half of buyers were new to Mac. in countries, the percentage is extremely high, like in over 80% of customers were a Mac for the first time. in our Mac business and our ability to continue innovate and gain in that area. Turning the Apple unit sales met our expectations the quarter. For some on how we think Apple Watch sales, we expect its seasonality to be similar to historical seasonality iPod, which generated or more of its sell-through in the December quarter. shipping Apple Watch just one year and it has become the best-selling loved smartwatch in the. fact, sales of Apple Watch during its first exceeded sales of iPhone in its first year. we refreshed the lineup the spring with new bands and a new point, the response customers been great. We're really excited about the first year with Apple Watch. We announced fantastic new products during March. IPhone SE became on March 31, so of its were reflected in our quarter results. But so far this quarter we're seeing terrific customer response. IPhone SE is the most powerful four-inch phone ever, and it's a great for customers over the world who want a compact with features and a compromising performance. been and exceeds supply at this point, but we're working hard get the iPhone SE into the hands of every customer who wants one quickly as possible.

We're very excited about the ways iPhone and Apple Watch are people lead healthier lives. As we continue through the June quarter, like that we measure the health of demand based sell-through.

As we had expected, our to last year influenced by the continued strength of the dollar against currencies. As Tim said, in currency, our revenue declined by 9%. On a geographic in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it declined in China and the rest of. We significant channel inventory reductions currency weakness, which affected our reported revenue for both these. In Mainland China, revenue was down 11%, the decline was in constant currency terms. in mind that we up against an extremely difficult compare when our China revenue grew 81%. optimistic about the China market over long term, and are committed to there for the long.

Operating margin 27.7% of revenue, and net income $10.5 billion. 51.2 million iPhones in quarter compared to 61.2 million in year-ago quarter, a decline of. It a particularly challenging comparison to the record quarter a year ago, iPhone sales grew 40%, as we entered last March quarter in imbalance, which was recovered during. We have exited the quarter within our seven-week target for channel. ASP was $642 to $659 in the year-ago quarter, with international currencies and very popular mid-tier and offerings contributing to the difference over year. iPhone's business markets continues to be very impressive.

We ended the quarter with $232.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase $17.2. We exited the March quarter with $72 billion term. We returned $10 billion to investors during the quarter, including $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and billion on repurchases of million Apple shares through open market. As Tim mentioned, today we are announcing update to program, which we increasing to total of $250 billion. Given our strong confidence in Apple's future the we see in our stock, the board increased the share authorization $35 billion, it the current $140 billion level to billion. We also know that the dividend is important many of investors who value income, and are raising it for time than four. We continue to plan for annual dividend increases going. In total, with updated program, during next eight we to $87 billion to our investors, which about 15% of market cap at current stock price. As in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with U.S. cash, future U.S. cash flow generation, borrowing from both and debt markets. move ahead the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, includes types forward-looking information that Nancy referred to the beginning of call. The revenue guidance implies a year-over-year as we lap an incredibly strong June quarter last year where grew due in part to iPhone upgrade purchases. This tough compare is compounded the continued weak macro environment year and strong U.S. dollar, which our revenue growth in international markets. The guidance also reflects a range of possible related to how quickly we can get into supply/demand balance for iPhone SE. to these our expected demand is greater the revenue range. implies a revenue decline of 15% to 19%, which comparable to the 17% sequential that we've averaged the March to quarter for three I described. We expect seasonal sequential declines in iPhone and iPad sales and a sequential increase in Mac. We know our revenue guidance falls short of market estimates the third. We expect continued cost improvements to be more than offset by the sequential of leverage from lower revenue and a different mix of. My first question was actually just clarification in terms of putting context that channel inventory. bigger Tim, was with the smartphone market now reaching a mature growth how Apple think of going forward?. let give you the data points on the sell-through, and then I'll answer strategic question. had a channel inventory reduction that was worth a than $800 million a. hi, it's Tim. In terms of do I the smartphone is mature, think that the market, you is currently not growing. reason that we're optimistic is we at the places that iPhone sales come from. And from upgrade point view as I in my comments, we compare slightly than the that we saw on iPhone 5s. than the iPhone 6, but I think that was an extraordinary that accelerated upgrades 2016 into 2015. we we're extremely excited that for the first we a record from switchers from other platforms, the we've ever in six-month period before, so we've got there. And then on markets, if you take a look at we grew by 56%, and we're placing increasing emphasis it's clear there will be versus the more areas. thing is with the iPhone SE, we have seen our ability attract more customers into the platform product that at a price point for us with the latest and so optimistic about even customers with that. of first, we're always looking in the market things that could things that we do today, become in something we do, allow us to entry into a category that excited about. And so continue to look and stay very active in M&A market. Tim, could you a little bit about the ASP trends?. specifically, you mentioned the iPhone SE is going impact it. for Luca, can a little bit about the Services segment terms what piece of the is driving growth, maybe little bit the profitability a net versus a gross basis that to in. Gene, I think the iPhone SE is attracting two types customers. both of these markets are very, important to us, and we're really excited about where it take us. think that will be happy with new-to-iPhone customers that see from here because of early returns we've had. It's the fact that we having entering the mix, and that obviously is to have downward pressure ASP. And also this channel reduction that about, obviously the channel inventory reduction will come from and that is also affecting the sequential on ASPs. on Services, we look at our Services it's obviously very well across the board. The biggest the part the Services business that is growing very we mentioned is the App Store. interesting us our business, which had been declining for a that we have both a model a streaming model, we an inflection point. We an iCloud business is very quickly, than App Store from a much lower base, but think it's important us as continue to these. a meaningful financial this point, but as look at the of that are going through Apple Pay right now and we ahead for long that be an interesting business for us. From a profitability standpoint, had last time when you look at it on so in terms of services, profitability of the business similar to company. Of course, when you net out the amount that is developers you look at it in terms of is reported our P&L, obviously that a that is than company average. Luca, this is the worst gross margin guide in a year and a half or so. And over the last couple of quarters, you've talked a number of tailwinds, including deferrals that went into in September. the question are some of those tailwinds winding down, is the significant guide down in gross the June quarter entirely to iPhone SE?. Katy, clearly the commodity environment quite favorable, and we continue to cost improvements. Obviously, what is different and as it on a sequential out the March we will have lots of leverage, is to have a negative on margins. And particularly when at iPhone, what I was mentioning to Gene earlier, I of things that ASPs, but obviously also affect margins. And the fact that had a channel reduction at end of the and we've got introduction of the iPhone SE level range. thank you, and a for Tim. I appreciate the optimism around iPhone growth, but with developed market 60% to 80%, the growth is going to have to come new. we expect Apple have more distribution and specifically your own stores that country?. short term, let me just make a couple of comments on the developed to make sure is clear. look our installed base of iPhone today versus two years it's increased 80%. As I about it in the comments, iPhone 6s upgrade rate is slightly higher than iPhone but than the 6. the nut the that I think there's still really, business in the markets, I want to those off. And it's our jobs to come up with great products that desire, and also to continue to attract Android switchers. worldwide share, there's still quite a bit of in the developed markets well. in India now for a years or more, but we've working with energy the last 18 months so, and I'm encouraged by the that we're beginning to see there, and a lot, lot more. as where maybe seven to ten ago from that point of view, think there's a really great there. My sense is that you talked about adjusting for the changes in inventory, that you're guiding sequential. And I think if you do the math, it's probably the same or perhaps a worse in terms unit sequentially to seasonality fiscal Q2 Q3. I the question is, given that you should be entering new markets and see pronounced elasticity the iPhone SE device, why we be seeing dramatically above normal seasonal in revenues units this. you could push back on me, but I can't help thinking that Apple introduced the in a similar move to move there was growth for one and the iPad margins and ASPs down. And it looks like you're introducing the SE, and at least on a sequential you're not calling for uplift even adjusting for channel inventory. Toni, it's Tim. Luca referred to, the vast, vast majority of that is in iPhone, so that would affect unit compare that may be thinking about. so I think it be the iPad mini?. I think the tablet market in general, one of the tablet is that replacement is materially different than smartphone. And as you probably know, we an in customer on the iPad. And haven't had an issue usage of iPad. But consumer behavior there is you tend to hold on for a very of time before upgrade. We continue be very optimistic on the iPad. had said in remarks, we believe we're going to have the compare for this that have had in some time. But I iPhone a particularly different of cycle to it than the market. And I can up, Tim, you alluded to the iPad the iPhone. My sense was when you were through the iPhone cycle was that you had that the upgrade was not materially different. think your characterization was that it accelerated a bit in U.S. but international had to be a bigger part of business, and replacement cycles a bit. the cycle was this year relative what you saw last year, how would your results have this and the half?. The iPhone upgrade cycle that we've measured for the first half this year, the first months of our fiscal year to be precise, is better than the rate saw the iPhone 5s years ago, lower than the iPhone. Now the news – the great news from my point is I think strategically positioned very because announced the SE. One, Tim, can talk a bit about what's on in China?. revenue I think was down 26%. if you could, talk about some of you're seeing there how think it's and maybe thoughts on iPhone SE adoption China as well. for the question. that driven shopping, and trading down significantly compared to what it was in ago. so I back up from this and look the larger picture, I think China not weak as been about. so we to be optimistic about and just would ask folks to underneath numbers at the details of them concluding anything. my second question is with regard OpEx leverage or about I look the revenue, your revenue is below our expectations, but is pretty line. how you thinking about for leverage, don't know, cost containment when macro is bad and is under pressure?. so when at our results, for example, our OpEx the quarter, the March was up which is the rate that seen in years. You continued significant research and because we really believe that's the future of the. We continue to invest in initiatives and projects ahead of. do more in-house technology development to do a few years ago, which we is a great investment for us to. And that part we really need and we want to invest in the business. then at our SG&A portion of OpEx for the quarter, it actually down slightly. So obviously, we about it, and course we at our revenue measures accordingly. when you look at the guidance that we provided for the quarter, 10% year-over-year I mentioned to for the quarter goes to a of 7% 9% up. that is incredibly competitive in industry, and want to continue to keep it that way. you view going forward as primary driver of earnings, or you it you mentioned platforms in terms of your systems, would with. So it's great that it's growing, but longer term, I view its role as more creating ecosystem supports the margins on hardware as independently earnings. The most important thing for us, Steve, that want have a great customer experience. so we last and working to that that we should pull the curtain so people could – could the Services in terms of the scale of it and the of it. As we earlier, the of the base services grew by 27% during the which was an over the quarter. then going back to the upgrades installed base, clearly mentioned that you've pulled some demand, which makes sense. think perceive that maybe the marginal improvements on the phone might be less and could be less forward. the same time, I you just announced that can get upgrade program online, I potentially could shorten it. believe that upgrade cycles are currently lengthening and can continue to so?. If you to the iPhone 5s, what we're seeing is the is slightly higher or there more people upgrading, if you will, in time period in terms of than the 5s. And so I think it on reference points. And so think in retrospect, you look at it and say, maybe the appropriate is more the iPhone and I think everybody that the were accelerated with iPhone 6. As you think about where were going to head last quarter you reported us and how it's changed obviously this of a disappointing environment. I think, Rod, you're asking about trough comment, if you will, from last quarter. And we made that, we did not contemplate or make a $2 billion-plus reduction channel inventory this quarter. And so if you factor that in at customer demand, is the that we look at it internally, I think a more reasonable comparison. Treasury obviously has made some rule and I maybe if, Luca, could comment on what impact to Apple from those if anything; and, Tim, more broadly, you see the tax situation for Apple looking forward?. As you we are largest U.S. by a margin, and we already pay full U.S. on all the profits the sales that the States. reform, maybe I can continue, and I'll let Tim more color, but we've been strong advocates for comprehensive corporate in this country. We think a reform the code would have significant benefits economy, and remain optimistic that we're to get to a point where we see that tax. The only would add, Rod, is I think there are a growing of people in both parties would like so I'm optimistic it will occur. Rod. A replay of today's call will be available for weeks as a on the iTunes Store and webcast on Apple.com/investor and via telephone.",58.05,0.72227407
4,apple,q3,2016,"Our initial sales data tells us that the iPhone SE is popular in both developed and emerging markets, and the percentage of iPhone SE sales going to customers who are new to iPhone is greater than we've seen in the first weeks of availability for other iPhones launched in the last several years.
Overall, we added millions of first-time smartphone buyers in the June quarter, and switchers accounted for the highest percentage of quarterly iPhone sales we've ever measured.
The growth was broad-based, with App Store revenue up 37% to a new all-time high, in addition to strong increases in Music, iCloud, and AppleCare.
We had our best iPad compare in 10 quarters, with revenue growing 7% thanks to the rollout of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. We're proud to have the most exciting lineup of tablets and accessories in the world and exceptionally high customer satisfaction and engagement.
Switchers and first-time smartphone buyers represented the lion's share of our iPhone sales in the quarter, and our installed base of iPhones in China has grown by 34% over the last year alone.
Customers can look forward to more expressive ways to communicate with messages now with its own App Store, allowing users to create and share content, make payments, add stickers and more, all without leaving messages, which is now one of the largest messaging services in the world.
Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. Revenue for the June quarter was $42.4 billion, near the high end of our guidance range, compared to $49.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.
On a geographic basis, our revenue grew strongly in Japan to a new June quarter record, and we experienced healthy growth in a number of other important markets, including Russia, Brazil, Turkey, India, and Canada.
Turning to Services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 19% over the June quarter last year.
Because of this continued growth, for the first nine months of our fiscal year, Services increased from 8% of our total revenue a year ago to 11% this year, and it represents an even higher percentage of our profitability.
Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. In addition to the overall market slowdown, we faced a very difficult compare to the year-ago quarter, when we introduced a new MacBook Pro and a new iMac. Despite these challenges, Mac continues to gain a high percentage of new customers, and our Mac installed base has grown to a new all-time high at the end of the June quarter.
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Luca.
How are you thinking about commodity pricing and mix of the new products and that just as you look to how you guided gross margin?
On the positive side, we're going to have leverage because we are guiding to a sequential increase in revenue, and we expect to have positive mix as we get into the September quarter, and these positives being offset more or less by what we call product transition costs, which are typical at this time of the year for us.
We think that the best experience for users include apps, and so we want to do everything that we can do to continue building that.
But there's an added factor this time around, which is you don't have the 4 million units of high-ASP, high-margin inventory drain in September like you did in the June quarter.
And, Tim, can you speak to how you envision the upgrade rate of the iPhone installed base to play out over the next quarter or the next year?
Starting with your comments on the June quarter, I just want to point out that when we talk about a $3.6 billion channel inventory reduction, that is not entirely related to iPhone.
On the September quarter, when I look at the sequential increase for iPhone units that we are expecting, I would say that it is, even with the sell-through adjustments that you've talked about, it's still pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past.
So I guess my question is, you have a mechanism, which is the Apple Upgrade Program, which takes replacement cycle out of the equation and puts people on buying the phone as a service.
And then just more broadly, is Apple thinking about ways to sell not only the iPhone, but more of its products on a monthly type subscription basis, perhaps in a more bundled fashion so that you can add more predictability to what is now largely a transactional revenue model?
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. The iPhone demand is made up, as you know, of upgraders, switchers and new to smartphone.
And we think that from a user point of view, as the smartphone itself becomes more and more essential to people's daily lives, which is a part of what I had talked about before, a part of bringing it into the home in a bigger way and in the car and at work and so forth, we think people will put more and more focus on what they're buying and the thing that Apple does best, which is provide this killer experience.
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I notice there are people that want to call it a new computer platform, and we'll see.
Luca, I just want to clarify that last point on ASPs on iPhone because last quarter it seemed that you were quite clear that that was a negative driver to the gross margin of the company.
How do you think about that as an actual business opportunity as opposed to here's an Apple box and we sell some units, but it's not that meaningful to the overall company in terms of size?
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thank you for the question.
Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple, Incorporated third quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings release conference call.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook.
Today we're pleased to report third quarter results that reflect stronger customer demand and business performance than we anticipated just 90 days ago and include several encouraging signs.
We saw tremendous performance from our Services businesses, which grew 19% to a June quarter record of $6 billion.
Most of our terrific Services performance during the quarter was fueled by our active installed base of devices, with installed base-related purchases of $10.3 billion accelerating to 29% growth year on year.
With watchOS 3 coming this fall, customers will be able to update their Apple Watches with an enhanced user interface, significantly improved performance and all-new fitness and health capabilities, including activity sharing.
We opened our 41st Greater China retail store during the quarter, and we also made a $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing.
According to China Mobile, there are more iPhones on their network than any other brand, with iPhone users ranking first in terms of customer loyalty, data usage and ARPU.
By far, the largest portion of our global channel inventory reduction was in Greater China, so our underlying business there is stronger than our results imply.
In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our total revenue from Greater China was almost $40 billion, up 55% from the same timeframe just two years ago, while iPhone units were up 47%.
This fall we'll also bring Apple Pay to Safari so users can easily make secure and private purchases when shopping on participating websites.
Tens of millions of users around the world are enjoying Apple Pay today at stores and in app, with estimated monthly active users up more than 450% year on year last month.
A recent survey by 451 Research found that among U.S. corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPhones.
This is the highest corporate purchase intent ever measured by the survey for the September quarter.
Corporate buyers report a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 71% for the September quarter.
We spent $4 billion on repurchases of 41.2 million Apple shares through open-market transactions.
You mentioned that 451 Research is finding business interest in phones, but their survey on consumers actually finds the lowest level of expectation for purchases in the next three months since 2008.
I was wondering if I could direct one at Tim. And my belief is that one of the bigger longer-term concerns for Apple is that the replacement cycle could just structurally elongate over time, particularly as your installed base of customers becomes less affluent and more international.
Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. So can you just give us your perspective on the market, your expectations around getting those services back up, and also regaining share?
Is this a business that ultimately impacts the Services line in any measurable way, or is Apple Pay generally about selling iPhones?
So the combination of these two things obviously had an impact on ASPs. But I think as I said or Tim said during the prepared remarks, we do expect iPhone ASP to improve sequentially as we move into the September quarter because these two factors that I just mentioned are not going to repeat.",62.01,0.8774418

Now I'll it over to Luca to share the September quarter. Revenue for September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the end of guidance range. revenue grew very strongly in many emerging markets, including Russia, the Middle East, Thailand and Vietnam, we continue to see solid Japan in Latin. Gross margin was 38%, at the top our guidance thanks to cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue and net income $9 billion. Diluted earnings share were $1.67 and from operations $16.1 billion, which is a for the September quarter. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone iPhone 7 Plus continued strong demand for other. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at end of the we iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we the well below five to seven week range of channel. We experienced strong iPhone growth in markets around the world, including America, Western Europe, Central Eastern Europe, East, India and South. for 7 7 Plus has significantly outpaced supply, on iPhone 7 and we're working very hard to get the new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible. iPhone increased $619 in the quarter, which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in quarter when we launched SE and we a significant channel inventory. We expect iPhone ASP increase markedly a sequential basis to a similar to ASP in the December quarter last. In the U.S. for instance, the latest survey fielded 451 Research found that among a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners a 97% customer rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, planned to purchase. to Services, we generated an all-time $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase 24% a year. The App growth rate has now accelerated for five consecutive quarters, reaching 43% in the September quarter. According to Annie, it generated 100% more global revenue than Google in the September. the great performance from apps, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories and Apple transaction volume has grown as Tim. 4.9 Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year given the launch of new Macs in the spring of. our Mac installed base reached a new all-time high at of the September quarter we'll have exciting news to share with current and future Mac very soon. We ended the quarter below our four to five week range for channel. to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last. ASP was $459, higher than a year ago, with increase driven by the new Pro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter our five to seven-week target. We to be highly both in of market share and customer metrics in the the tablet market where we. from NPD indicates that iPad share in the tablet market in the quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above $200. Corporate buyers a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter. In the enterprise market, we are examples iPad and Mac deployment.

Thanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the is saving as much as when the cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a full-year lifecycle. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase $6.1. We $7 billion debt in July, leaving us with $79 in term debt at the end of the. We returned over $9 to investors during the September quarter as. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open market transactions, and launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and of 22.5 million. During the September quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred billion in expenditures. Our effective rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than of a differential graphic of relative to our regional. rate for full fiscal year was 25.6% As we move ahead the quarter, would like to outlook, which the types of information that referred to at beginning of the. represents a return to over the all-time revenue record in the December quarter a year. And Tim, now that we're month in the iPhone 7, are seeing anything measurable terms of the annual upgrades?. And second is, historically in terms of new product categories, you guys always looked for unique advantage before getting into a segment. There are lot of rumors out there, and like on how you about an advantage that Apple could add in the auto space?. In iPhone the carriers that upgrade plans, information that we from is that demand is very robust. from a worldwide point of view, the truth is demand is outstripping in majority places, particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus. I can't speak about rumors, but as know, we for ways we can improve the and customers' experience on different sets of. And we are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an that there lot that will either become or will be to revolutionize the experience. Do you think we'll at equilibrium the end of quarter supplies?. I wouldn't yes at this because the underlying demand extremely strong on both products but particularly on the iPhone 7 versus our going the product. Luca, can you help us understand what's embedded in revenue guidance for the extra as any of channel inventory given all the major are below target?. Just trying get at you see revenue and in growth year on year on more of a sellout you adjust for those two factors?. Let me a few things on the 14th revenue up for the quarter. Keep in mind that year ago for us was an quarterly revenue record. the interest from customers on iPhone 7 and 7 is very strong. We think can continue to grow very well into December. You 14th week, and the few extra days do help this. I think important to keep in mind that are other factors that go and offset days. know, launch timing the new iPhone different year. know, we iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units in the quarter 2016. said, we are very supply constrained on iPhone Plus this year. And also foreign exchange environment remains and we expect be about $650 headwind on a year-over-year basis into December quarter. So I that gives you a sense when you take into account all factors, believe that the. should we read into that R&D has more than doubled the past three years while sales was of a of that?. Are R&D investments just less efficient than they were in the history, we think about that incremental spend products that haven't yet come to market?. some amount that are products that today are in the phase that have reached the so that's a it. also put a lot of emphasis on our Services business well and on making the ecosystem even. can talk a bit more about China, just how you're thinking about where you're seeing pressure?. I know you that expect to a significant rebound during the first quarter, but what are customers telling the in. to of back up results for the the 90-day clock, and the full year of we were down 17% compared the year 2015 was up 84% from the previous. So if look to 2016, the revenue grew 52% and the CAGR 23%,. as probably know, the 2016 performance hurt by the of the which affected about 3%, so the business performance 14% down. so when rate in fiscal year 2016 to a normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the as point, it further fall. of year, we put in too much channel inventory and been resetting the channel inventory over the few quarters that beyond it or came after. the response to the iPhone 7 7 Plus been very positive. we'll out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough give you guidance that we're returning to growth this which obviously feels very good us. And so with the number of â growing into middle and the fairly low, around 50% or so, then I think we to have a good opportunity there, and so we. And I mean like smaller ones that done sort of cadence, but there was clearly least week in the world. So I just, if you can give sort of an overall how you think about that might be a bit larger normal. are open to of any size that are strategic value where we better products to our customers and. I guess a could say Apple benefiting from extra week quarter and benefiting from Samsung being in complete. And it reasonable to think is an ongoing growing business the company?. think you mentioned number of things that affecting us in December and I went through with Katy just. know that we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million a year. mentioned two that affect us, the one-timer from year ago you obviously need compare and the FX that reality our business right. And so when we look at these things in its we that the total company of course, we believe that going to grow. You that we don't get specific product a unit standpoint giving and so we feel very confident about the trajectory for the company and iPhone going. Apple has started on a limited scale some its own and whether you think content creation and ownership important to Apple, or ultimately sees its place the chain as being more the ecosystem and distribution. I wanted to dig the Services business a more. you look at Services the growth of the Services revenue been accelerating the course of the year during period when, you know, revenue came slightly. So that means in practice is that what we are with our customers our services that the people are actually taking of our services time tend more and more our. We've customers that are very engaged with our products. mentioned Apple Music, but we other parts of the business that continue even as I said during a of time when our have come down a bit. And then we've seen an increasing focus on artificial intelligence, both in smartphones like the Pixel from Google but also in some of the assistance, the Echo. answer your second question first, I think that most people like an assistant them all the. I'm just saying on a balance point of view, I think usage one on the phone will greater. you can just look at Siri today and this is now accelerating with iOS 10 and Mac, but we've been getting billion a for Siri. is on this worldwide, and so it's a U.S. but we want deliver a great experience around the it globally, and we've a lot of energy doing. the balance between privacy and AI, this is a long a high I think it's a false trade-off that you to believe that have to give in order to have AI something for you. Luca, I wanted ask about deferred revenue which was down about $1.3 June and I down $400 million September. Those are rather large declines, given fact that your units are down and had the accounting change back in September. talk about of the drivers of that what you might expect forward?. not to see the same thing going forward. And then we defer some on some other categories, like for example gift cards or some but in general by far the largest element is the in ESPs. And I don't you're going to see the same going forward. And then, Tim, some investors are antsy that Apple has not acquired new profit pools or introduced financially material new in years. does Apple today have a grand strategy for what you want to do?. in a couple years, we will see this flurry of new products and it'll sort of match do, but it's not yet?. your approach I guess to new products, do you have sense of where technology and you're going to play?. Tim and Luca, you saw that you could raise ASP on iPhone 7 by $20 you're completely sold out. this device a central role in our lives, so much owners probably look at that incremental cost as great trade-off to get best. So as you see and more features being added into do you conceptually you are anywhere to the point where ASPs further would be to. the 7 Plus, we put incredible of innovation into the camera and overall photo and customers are obviously using and discovered that they it. can Wamsi, keep in mind that in a lot of around world, reality that our customers seen price because of the right. Tim, this year we saw carrier come back to force post the launch of iPhone 7, 7 Plus. years ago there was a giant upgrade to iPhone from 6, 6 Plus. Do you think every couple of years we are likely to see carrier incentives come back into play given worries around thereby making the phone affordable?. of competition for customers in U.S. which I think is the market that you're talking. But suspect that any time there large phone that's in that two year kind that it tends to be sweet and I think probably will see a of people trying to recruit customers. Tim, you'd mentioned your prepared comments a bit about we've been doing a lot of work talking the opportunity India. And get lot of pushback about disposable income metrics and lots of like that, yet the population being can you a little bit about, do you see that India could at some point be as big. And appears that legal rules have kind of prevented from going in a lot, but looks like that's changing. it just kind of rate of investing that you're going?. On India, think it's important to look only at per capita which may be what looking at, but sort at the number of people that are or will move the middle class sort next decade. this year or this year and next year, there are enormous investments 4G we couldn't be more excited that because it really takes a great working with iPhone to produce great experience people. think the government is much more focused the on creating jobs, which is fantastic, because you really the kind of infrastructure and the to do. it's that the population of India will exceed China sometime in probably the next decade maybe than. truth is, there's going to be a of there and a lot people in the middle that will really a some of those. our starting point, even though we've growing a lot, is a lot of there mind, and so we working very hard to that opportunity. We want continue to business in all the areas where think is critical for us. You've seen the growth over the last of years. We are important investments in centers because we want to support our services. At the same time, we want to continue be efficient and lean. that we've done very well over the years and want to continue to do that. And is kind of the approach that we to take and continue to take going forward. If you step back for a look at implied guidance for December quarter, got an expense to revenue ratio 9%. And so we want to to have this balance, make the right remain efficient. had one for and then a follow-up for Tim. So, Luca, I wanted to ask about the margin guidance. I think that the Street and we expecting something little bit higher. I'm just do you that people are mis-modeling that or is there something going on with pricing or there you provide us more color on?. Yeah, Rod, me give you some detail on a sequential basis and give something on a where the disconnect comes from, looking last margins the December quarter. On a year-over-year keep in that last in Q1, we did 40%, of things that think need to be considered before doing. And you're left with less than 100 points on a year-over-year basis where we have the reality new cost structures into our products. is very, important I think for investors to understand that during the last two years. something that we offset almost entirely a number of going from pricing actions to cost to our hedging program, but at some the strong normal and we to work with that. I think over the years, we made good trade-offs and gross have been quite stable time. then, I wanted you to ask this question comes up in a wanted to ask could talk to us a little bit arguments on sides the dividend question. tell us what your intentions here, but you could us understand how that thinking the works, it be great. that Apple is very undervalued, and so we're with confidence in company that we know really. And addition to that, we know that shareholders really like a ongoing income, and so a amount that we think is a and have good record of raising annually. call will be available for weeks as podcast on the Store, as webcast on and via and your numbers for telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820.",56.22,0.747703492641449

We generated the quarterly revenue in Apple's history along with all-time unit and revenue records for iPhone and Apple Watch, all-time revenue records for Services and Mac, and all-time revenue records for four out of our geographic. The strong performance of our business also produced record earnings per share. Revenue in quarter was $78.4 billion, was above the of guidance range. iPhone had a quarter thanks to exceptional demand that beat our own internal expectations. 7 is our most popular model, saw especially strong demand iPhone 7 Plus, which higher portion of the new product mix than ever seen with models in the past. Demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded throughout the and we came into supply/demand balance in January. 7 Plus has earned rave reviews for its advanced new features, especially the dual camera system, which produces stunning portraits and high-quality zoom. Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are empowering our customers to be more more engaged, and more expressive than ever by hardware, software, services to create experiences that only Apple can deliver. It was our best quarter ever for Services, with almost $7.2 in revenue.

And beginning this quarter, Comcast customers can pay their bill in a single touch with Apple Pay. becoming a larger part of our we expect revenues be the of a Fortune 100 company this year. Our Services offerings are now driving over million paid customer subscriptions. We feel great this momentum, and goal is double the of Services business the next four. Mac not only returned to growth but generated its highest quarterly revenue ever. We were supply constrained new MacBook Pro throughout December quarter and are now coming into supply/demand. was also best quarter ever for Apple Watch, both units and revenues, with holiday demand so strong that couldn't enough. Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch in the world and the most loved, the highest customer in its category wide margin. With AirPods off to a fantastic full first year Apple Watch, and Beats headphones offering a great wireless experience using the Apple-designed W1 chip, we now have a. For example, major automaker is committed to CarPlay with over 200 different models announced, five of the top 10 models in the United States. Siri a new Home in iOS 10, you go, you can easily and all your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad,. The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly, with many exciting solutions announced just including video cameras, detectors, and sensors for doors, windows, and. of home automation unimaginable just a few years ago, it's here today with iOS and HomeKit. We're making progress in the market alongside our major partners. With enhanced performance, up to eight times faster roaming, better reliability for apps, and native voice experience, we're excited about how much more productive the workforce will be with these great capabilities. In fact, the total number of joint customer opportunities has grown 70% last quarter. As we reflect on record-breaking December I'd like to our our business partners, and our employees for their contributions commitment. And like to thank all of our around the for their and loyalty, which ultimately drive these results. like to it over to Luca to the quarter in more detail. Revenue for December quarter was $78.4 billion, the highest quarterly revenue in history of and above guidance range. As Tim mentioned, the strength of our results was very broad-based, as we set revenue records for iPhone, for for Mac, for Apple Watch. We also established new all-time revenue records in most developed emerging markets, with strong growth rates in many countries, including the U.S., France, Australia, Brazil, India, Turkey, and. As we expected, our year-over-year performance in Greater China improved significantly to the quarter. Total Greater China segment revenue was down 12%, but revenue from Mainland China even with all-time record results from year ago grew in constant currency terms. In all other geographic segments, generated all-time quarterly record results. We had the benefit 14th week during the this year, but. Third, the stronger U.S. dollar total revenue growth this year by 100 points. And fourth, our year-ago revenue included the of one-off $548 million infringement payment. customer left us supply/demand imbalance for several of our throughout the quarter this year. Gross margin 38.5%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin 29.8% of revenue, and net income $17.9 billion. Diluted earnings share were $3.36, a new all-time record, and cash flow operations was $27.1 billion. had a terrific quarter for as we sold 78.3 million units, a new all-time and an increase of 5% over. Customer demand even higher than our reported results, iPhone unit sell-through was up 8%. We saw double-digit iPhone growth in the U.S., in Canada, Western Europe, and Australia, and even stronger growth in including Brazil, Turkey, Central and Eastern Europe, and. ASP increased to $695 in December quarter from $619 in September quarter, driven by very strong product mix and amazing success of iPhone 7 Plus. stronger demand than last year, we added 1.2 million units of channel inventory across the quarter, significantly less than 3.3 million units a year ago. And we exited the quarter near the end of our to 7-week channel range. Customer interest and satisfaction iPhone are exceptional, not only with consumers, but also with business users. smartphone buyers, the iPhone customer satisfaction rating was. And those planning to purchase smartphones in March quarter, 78% plan to. to Services, we generated an record $7.2 billion in revenue, an of year over. On one the 14th week added to Services this December quarter. the other hand, that benefit was more than offset by the comparison the one-off million patent infringement payment in revenue a ago. The App Store continued its impressive run, all previous revenue records. Year-over-year Store revenue growth was through the 13 weeks of the. It's to see that both average revenue per account and the number of paying accounts strongly during the quarter. We sold 5.4 million and generated our highest-ever quarterly Mac. We were very to report double-digit growth in several including Japan, Mainland China, India, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as well as in. We ended the quarter at the low end of 4 to 5-week range for channel. Turning iPad, we sold 13.1 million units, which was of our. And we posted double-digit growth in both Mainland China and India, we've expanded channels in those countries and we continue to attract a percentage of first-time buyers. We also reduced channel inventory about 700,000 units as opposed to increase 900,000 units last year, and we exited near low end our five to seven-week target. iPad is incredibly successful in the segments of the tablet where we compete, in terms market share and metrics. from NPD indicates that iPad 85% share of the U.S. for tablets priced above $200. Corporate buyers a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 66% for the March quarter. In fact, of all sizes are choosing iPad and iPhone to have them reimagine their everyday activities. We're seeing strong momentum in sectors such as retail, where iOS solutions being deployed for everything from product development to logistics to point-of-sale. Companies like Toys ""R"" Us, Coach, and Kate Spade are using and our mobility solutions to dramatically transform their customer and employee experiences. Our retail experienced strong double-digit growth in visitors and revenue in the December. We continually updating our stores and adding new and exciting outreach programs to educate kids on our products, entertain the with fresh music, teach future Swift developers to code, start, and evolve. We ended the quarter with $246.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase $8.5. We returned almost billion to investors during a very busy December quarter for our return. We spent $5 billion on repurchases of 44.3 million Apple shares through open market. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, in an initial delivery and retirement of 44.8 shares. Our tax for quarter was 26%, as expected. we move into the March quarter, I'd like to review our which the of forward-looking information that Nancy referred at the beginning the call. This guidance range includes a $1.2 billion year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange. This guidance range includes an 80 basis points headwind from foreign exchange. First, Luca, are the factors that caused you to the gross margin for the March quarter?. back at our history, 100 basis points range gross margin is unusual. during a period when foreign exchange is volatile, think it's more prudent to broaden the range a bit. I've mentioned we expect assuming that don't move too much, expect foreign exchange to a major negative as we move from the December the March quarter. You know that the dollar has appreciated significantly toward the December quarter, so we've 80 basis points of sequential foreign. We also have the sequential of leverage, which is typical of our seasonality, but we expect to these two with cost efficiencies also with our mix products and. So obviously if the dollar is a little strong is today, we could do bit on gross margins. So I think that's very for the country good Apple. of original content, have put our toe in the water with doing some original content Apple Music, that will rolling out through the year. more things planned for it it's a long way in a year, and it us clear platform to build off. Two, embedded in the 150 paid subscriptions I mentioned in my opening there are a number of that are a we participate some by offering our platform selling and distributing. thirdly, with our toe in the water, we're a lot about the original content and thinking ways we play at that. guess the first question, really appreciate the you guys are providing your Services business, which up 18% over. much of that do you think is growth in your installed versus increased on per iOS to iOS basis?. what is particularly interesting to us is to that the number of people that are transacting our is increasing strong and we're ARPU customer is increasing digits, right. quality and the of content that make available in our improves all time. And that's we are about the future the Services business. I could just switch gears on a there has been a fair amount your market in China what's over there. Your numbers actually look fairly impressive in Greater China, China specifically. If you look at how we the quarter, as I Luca shared, our Greater China 12%, and about points of related, it's an point decline in currency. And then within China, you look at the PRC, our revenue was year year, and was against the all-time record quarter. So it's a better performance every way you look at versus what we had experienced the prior quarters. Underneath that, what we've is that iPhone 7 was smartphone in China the quarter, according Kantar. set new record for Services in China, as the company. Mac revenue was up double year over year. were also double digit Mainland China, was obviously different than the trend that we saw in the balance the world. also of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first-time which is a very number that. And obviously, our installed base continues to grow there in the double digits. I want to imply that, although I do like many, things that I've seen and broad-based pluses were across our line. Can you a bit more about the business?. And trying to figure out is I think the number was be within four years, at least your expectation. And then, as you grow your Services business, there anything we should keep mind a perspective?. lower margin or similar, so can about the trajectory and the contribution to the bottom line. Obviously, within the Services have a number of categories. said my opening comments that we grew 43% 13 weeks over 13 weeks, even more the quarter,. are seeing significant growth not only in developed markets, where you to lot transaction volume, but see great growth in places like China, example. We can grow, for example, our developer community a number of emerging. And so as we look, I earlier, as at number of people that transact growing double digits, see amount spent per paid growing so that App Store is driver. Obviously now, by having the of the download business the streaming service, which have until we've been able bring our business back growth. over last quarters, and we feel very good about that. A lot of it from the fact that install base of devices around world continues grow very strong double digits. We said many in aggregate our Services business tends to margins that are above company. Within the Services business, have different margin also as you know, we account for some of services in ways. In other cases, we perform as agents, example, to our developers, and that different margin percentages. I in the past there in of the emerging the you were basically not able â you weren't getting the volumes because to raise given the. But a lot of the emerging markets actually doing pretty well quarter. Since 2014, so we're talking 2.5 years ago, the dollar strengthened 25% against the basket of where we do. I've mentioned that foreign exchange is a significant for us, at the revenue level at the margin level. middle class is growing places like China, India, Brazil, but certainly the strong dollar doesn't help us. We always to find the optimal balance between units, revenue, and margin, and it becomes difficult as dollar. Luca, I'm wondering if you could talk a bit about gross margins. Sales obviously the high end of your revenue range. like gross margin was dead down the middle. you talk about the puts and takes in gross in the please?. We were actually at the high end of range gross. And really, the slight improvement over the midpoint of the due to fact that revenue ahead of expectations, and we got bit more out of the revenue levels. We very good about the gross margins for the. demonetization move in that created lots of economic pressure there quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue and we were very happy that. in the longer it's great move, and I really good how we're there. in discussions on number of things, retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and great. I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the upside in the with record revenues in every except for. If you look at absolute number upgraders, it was the that seen in quarter. And if you look the switcher number, it's the highest we've seen any quarter. you look at upgrade rate, similar to year. tell you that the way we look at this is where you have constraint, it's to too conclusions from. As comps get easier this year, I think you're going be returning to growth in region. And then just to give us the context, I you talked the constant in revenue China. But curious if you strip out the double-digit increase iPad and MacBook potentially the mix to the iPhone 7 Plus, curious what iPhone units in Mainland China. So I think units on a sell-through basis were up 8%. So making all those it looks like iPhone units were probably up low single digits. But, Luca, you to the that your base was double digits. And more specifically, just like your broader perspective on investors should think about upgrade rates. you could step back and just a little bit more about how investors think about or what the trajectory has been over the two years and think going forward. Do you believe there are opportunities for that upgrade rate to or replacement to accelerate forward?. think question, a number of points that I to make. Starting with growth in the install iPhones, it's growing strong very good for a number of reasons, the fact that it's a driver for Services business. When we I think we see developments. we felt very, very good the unit growth we had in many markets the world. So I we are very, very performance. point that I think need to when you think about clearly, this issue of help us. Could we sell significantly more an upgrade cycle standpoint outside the United where we've been forced to increase by up to 20%, 40% in countries?. you think impact that this is on local demand, that doesn't us. The more able to innovate with of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate. at point in time that it will take some time, but the I think common sense will prevail courts will see it for what it. like it was about possibly even positive. You said was I it was well below the Street's expectations. talk about the iPad and what you going forward. The Steve, we had a 1.6 million-unit the years. On top of that from ASP point view, in the year-ago quarter launched the Pro 13. We would done the fill plus the launch of the product, so that have bolstered the in that particular. In to of that, did under-call the number of iPads that would in demand for quarter, and that compounded a issue had with one of our. If I zoom out of the and look at it, we've got exciting things coming iPad. I feel very about where we can take the product. the number of people buying iPads for first time, which is a good to look at from things reaching a or not, numbers indicate that it's not kind thing. And I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still currently in this issue now, and I'm not projecting to get out that quarter. And then, Tim, investors tend to think of the iPhone mature technology as incremental, yet I believe you said plenty runway in terms of appealing features. you there are future enhancements coming that will be viewed as material by and changes form factor, beyond way the looks?. time that you think could surprise people?. it's â every year it becomes more important to people's lives more things people are with. when at of these things, usage going up, developers still innovating, we've got some exciting things in the pipeline, I feel really, good it.

We will to review capital allocation taking into the needs of our business, investment opportunities, and our. move ahead the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, includes types forward-looking information that Nancy referred to the beginning of call. How were able to gross margins sequentially and guide rather for the June quarter in light of what's going on in market. me with performance for the quarter, which were very with. And this in spite of fact, as know, that we leverage as go from December quarter to the March quarter. And the fact that Services mix increases as we go through the is course also given the profile of gross margin Services. As we into the June as you we tend to have some level margin compression we from the March to the quarter. We also have a different mix products as we into the quarter, and the cost pressures on. don't guide past the quarter, we expect it be there for time being. a follow-up for Tim, as you noted in remarks, the 7 Plus demand, it's selling well. And this a product that was supply-constrained in quarter. one of the things that we not get the mix between the 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. And so took us a little while to adjust all the way back the chain and to iPhone 7 Plus into which early past quarter. you a bit about what's going on China and give us some more color, especially as you're going the year?. then obviously you won't talk about the next product launch, but just are there any in demand with China down 14%?. if look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 we sold the number of Plus models the half ever before, compared 6s compared to 6 Plus. The Mac revenue was up 20% in China, and had extremely strong Services growth the quarter in China. As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online did overall and China. They grew 21%, which is acceleration from what seen in the previous. â which for is incredibly important in the retail stores because do a lot more than sell â up 27% year on year. Also, where the 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform on some of the previous generation iPhones. What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but make progress. You increased your program, you still have I think $160 cash obviously continue generate cash. Shannon, you know we our capital program. Essentially the last five years, way we've run the company essentially return free cash flow our investors. that announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country, there's a lot that needs to happen there, we'll see. wanted to start off going back to 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if could comment unique number of users. made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average per user was up, or maybe Luca. There is some level overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very large, obviously less million. And if remember, quoted the same number a quarter and talked 150 million. So when think about sequential increase 15 million subscriptions the to the quarter, it really you a sense for momentum that we content. look at the that are happening on our content particularly on the App which is the largest, we fairly consistently things. increase in number of paying accounts we value this last 90 days is largest we've had. So this very large of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing ecosystem, which is obviously improving the time in quality quantity, then start on stores, and number is growing very,. we're also seeing as we look people start paying on our stores, we see pretty common trend over time. keep track across cohorts of customers, that people into the ecosystem and start on the ecosystem, we a spending profile very similar around world. so obviously, combination of spending more over time and adding people that are actually spending the stores contributes to this 40% growth mentioned for the App Store basis. thanks, Luca, and a follow-up for Tim. The keeps growing, and course the profit contribution from that is growing. we've at the same think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain key technologies, that you want penetrate the with. I wonder if could comment a little on your strategy there in terms of the of that profit contribution that Services how you intend to apply to rest of. the that pricing is come with price that we think is good value for the delivering, and we do that on side as well on the side. some consider disappointing, what seems to be a very good and ironically the competition seems be part of the market right now. Do you see A), expanding over time into a broader product line; and B), increasingly being independent of the iPhone term?. The watch units more than doubled in our top ten which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. some people are doing when you the revenues with the revenues for and as you this was the quarter shipments for AirPods. then the that a group of our customers well, and look on trailing 12 months this not forecast â that was well the Fortune 500. specifically, I wonder what you believe is risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response, such as withholding modem chip potentially getting on in select around the world. why would Apple potentially take on those just in advance of what will arguably your significant and largest product launch in history?. The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying of the total iPhone value. I was wondering if I could just follow a bit on iPhone. If try for the drawdown in inventory and extra week last quarter, think sequentially iPhones declined 27% if I. rate improved marginally, when you adjust for the extra week. In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory 1.2 million units. I think that when you you're going to that the performance similar the quarters. And so four the operating segments, as Luca mentioned in his we had very good growth. was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which growing incredibly around world. Last year, had a million-unit channel inventory reduction for the. So expecting for this year just we have an apples-to-apples comparison as we think about your guidance. As know, Simona, we do not provide and around inventory but our goal is always to have the right amount weeks inventory in channel. if you look at last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory the June quarter, I think a fair to have. you've been excited about the India market for some time and have made strides in establishing a manufacturing, and R&D presence there. curious you look at that market and the rollout of us assume Apple can something on of 10 million to million iPhones year then grow. We have ton of energy going into country on a number of and is the third world today behind China and the. so we believe, particularly now 4G infrastructure is going in the country and continuing to be expanded, that is a huge opportunity Apple there. in your prepared comments you mentioned was growing digit, which is. But I believe if you look geographic India is underpenetrated from an Apple reception but yet they LTE, you have the iPhone a lower iPhone. you think that say this next 12 18 months is a or is it more you to work with there?. it's a opportunity too, and so we're all the things that we to bear in other markets that we've well and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem. just over there opening last quarter, and so there are a on there. are really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. investment really began rolling in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know. call will be available for two weeks as a podcast iTunes a webcast apple.com/investor, and via and the numbers for telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820.",48.67,0.7625612020492554

We are very with these iPhone results, especially the tough comparison the June quarter last year when we launched iPhone. ASP was $606, up $595 a year ago, to strong demand for iPhone Plus, which represented a higher percentage of the iPhone mix compared year ago. The of the stronger on ASP was partially offset by negative foreign exchange over year and the reduction in channel inventory, which took entirely at the high of the portfolio. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong with both consumers and business uses. to buy a smartphone, purchase intention for iPhone was nearly three times the rate of our closest. to Services, we set an all-time quarterly record of $7.3 up year over. And according to App latest report, it continues to be by a margin the preferred destination purchases, nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. Revenue our Apple Music streaming service and from iCloud storage also very strongly. The reach, usage, and functionality of Apple Pay continue to grow. Apple Pay is by far the number one NFC payment service on mobile devices, with 90% of transactions globally. Momentum strongest in international markets, where the infrastructure for mobile has developed faster than in U.S. In fact, three out of four Apple Pay transactions happen outside U.S. And the launch iOS 11 this fall, our users the will able to make and receive person-to-person payments quickly, easily, and securely.

We were happy to see iPad growth each of our geographic segments, with strong double-digit increases in key such as U.S., Japan, Germany, France, and Greater. We exited the quarter within our five to range for channel. NPD indicates that had 55% share of the U.S. market in the month June, including 8 the best-selling tablets.

SAP has also released SuccessFactors Mobile, its first native iOS app for resources, which will support 47 million iPhone iPad users worldwide industries. We jointly developed programs such as the Connected Store, a of a retail environment, demonstrating iOS tools for sales and demand tailored apps associates, store management, and. also had a tremendous quarter for iPad in education, up 32%. Following the launch of our new iPad in an update to our popular Classroom app, and enhancements to that make managing iPads the classroom easier. iPad was chosen because of its power and durability, of use, multimedia and accessibility features, and the extensive catalog of apps specifically for education. The Shawnee Mission School District outside Kansas City recently purchased 19,000 iPads, extending its One to program started iPad's intuitive interface, superior reliability, and expansive ecosystem of iOS tools for education. It was a very busy quarter for our retail and online which collectively welcomed over 300 visitors. In addition to our spectacular new at the Dubai Mall, we opened our first in Singapore in during the expanding our total store to 497. In May, we kicked off Today at Apple, with new in-store programming from music to photography to and coding. As Tim last quarter, we have entered new chapter retail with unique and rewarding experiences for our customers and some stunning coming in the near future. We ended the quarter with $261.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase $4.7. We retired $3.5 billion of debt and issued the equivalent of $10.8 euro and U.S. debt during quarter, including our second to $96.4 debt and $12 billion in commercial. We paid $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $4.5 billion on repurchases of 30.4 million Apple through open market. We a new $3 ASR program, in initial delivery and retirement 15.6 million shares, and we retired 3.4 million shares the completion of our 10th ASR during the. move ahead the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, includes types forward-looking information that Nancy referred to the beginning of call. limit one question and follow-up. Luca, first question for you, margin guidance strong, but it did down from your June guidance, and you also narrowed the to 50 basis points. terms the range that we for gross margins, we have fairly good on where we are with our and that allows us mitigate some the volatility there. a question for Tim Luca. outlined on this and at the Developer Conference in June, there is unprecedented that either ramped volume launched in the of year. Luca mentioned, we did some transitional in our guidance for the quarter, is typically the case. I think obviously, there continues to be strong demand for smartphones. But perhaps mix shift, I think you brought back the iPhone this quarter be bit more price aggressive. If you look underneath mainland China was flat year-over-year Q3. was flat year-on-year, similar as the market was. the peg to dollar there a view and tourism being what it is, I don't really when market will back. note upgraders both for the quarter actually for the full fiscal to-date our highest and so that felt very good. In terms of WeChat, way that I look at this is because share because iOS share not nearly a of market in China, the fact a people use makes switching opportunity even. that's more the case than the risk that a of folks have out. They've done a great of implementing a lot of iOS apps and we're looking forward working with even more to build greater experiences for our users in. And then can you about the composition of the installed base of at this as obviously we're getting to a refresh?. quantity point of view, the upgrades for this year are the highest that seen. However, if you look it from upgrade rate point view of the absolute number, the rate similar to we saw with previous except for 6, which as we called out in past an abnormally upgrade rate. We continue to people moving over to and helped us making results that Luca announced earlier, including the channel inventory. I think, we all understand that you to within the but you could comment a bit on feel your relationship is with if there certain that you can't cross. Starting the take this question from what doing to increase which is probably it's rooted. do that we have a responsibility in the U.S. to increase economic activity, including because Apple been created. And just a couple months we announced a new curriculum that's focused on community schools and community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges, kids did not have coding their elementary and high years. And we're excited about because we it could the of the developer community and the quantity. this area in general all the things we do for the developer the largest contribution that Apple can make this is the fastest job segment the and I think be. If you look at the second area, we have purchased or we purchased year about $50 billion of goods services from suppliers. And you may have seen that at the beginning of quarter, sometime in we announced a fund, Advanced Manufacturing that initially placing $1 in. And we purchase that glass essentially it to the world iPhones iPads. there probably plants that can benefit from some investment to grow expand or even maybe set up shop U.S. for the time, so excited about. the third is we have two-thirds or so of our base in the U.S. only a of revenues being here, we'll some things that we'll that later the year. that's we're doing from a job growth point of view, and we're of that. Now turning China, let comment on what I is the root of question about this VPN issue. The government China back in tightening the regulations associated with VPN and we have number of those on our store. Earlier this they began a renewed effort to enforce that policy, we were required by the to remove the VPN from the App these new. Today there are actually still hundreds of VPN apps on the App Store, including hundreds by developers that are China, and so there apps available. We rather not remove the but like we do other countries, we the law wherever we do. strongly believe that participating markets and bringing benefits to is in the best interest of the folks and other countries well. And like we would if the U.S. the law we'd have to by them in both cases, that doesn't that don't our point view in appropriate way. you, a question for maybe on the iPhone base. upgrade rates over the longer there are lots moving parts, and I get there's I guess mix shift of your base. the upgrade rate is function of many, different things, the of the the of the base, the that is at the the regional distribution, the upgrade plans that various markets the. think general, because our installed base was strong digit once again, there's lot of that are very positive us. the upgraders and the switchers we see, and the buyer category is still out there too in several countries, including some that you not there's a sizable in some. areas, a lot of opportunity. Luca, typically in the fiscal Q4, Apple builds considerable iPhone channel inventory, like 2 million 3 million units. we think about what's embedded in your guidance for fiscal channel inventory for iPhone, should we normal seasonal build, or is it likely to be higher given the very low point?. We are providing a fairly wide from obviously that also has an impact on potential channel. thing that would tell is that we feel good about performance of business right now. think that our Services business will to grow. We've a lot momentum iPad and Mac because we refreshed the of products. in general, even the in China, Tim has it. So are the drivers our guidance range for the quarter. I was wondering could maybe talk a little bit about things you mentioned in before. which you have described intense interest, I don't even think there TV on this call. there has been press reports that Apple has been testing autonomous vehicles for potentially up to a year. two to give the Apple Music subscriber some exclusive content hopefully grow subscriber base. And we've hired two great folks with lots of experience in creating content like Breaking Bad and The Crown and some really content. may be a hard question answer in a condensed but would you what you expect the most near-term applications will be using ARKit?. does this come to market in the most significant way in the next quarters as Apple becomes largest global platform for as you've talked about?. answer your what category it starts in, just take a look what's on the web in terms what people doing and it is over the place. AR big and profound and this is one those huge things that at and marvel on start of. So I think that customers to see it in a variety ways. feels great to get at a level that can get all of the developers behind so couldn't be more excited it. to start off on your Services revenues actually I think accelerated by 400 points what you guys in the first half of this. Is there a way to think about in a traditional manner that Services versus the installed growing?. We've got multiple categories in the Services it's difficult talk about ARPU in general. One that is very, very important us is the fact the App which is the largest Services is an increasingly amount of paying accounts. basis, the number of accounts that are actually transacting paying on the App Store growing. One of for example, is the fact that are making easier for to pay on the App. We launched Alipay, for example, in China during the December. That has obviously helped lot with growth in the number paid accounts. continue to bring more and more forms of payment in App Store around world. The other reason why the number paying accounts is fact that the quality and the quantity continues to improve. have other businesses the Apple service, which is growing very fast we it a couple of years ago, so we are getting lot of new subscribers. The number of people on our stores continues to grow. In terms of ARPU, maybe I can make a comment on ARPU to the App Store. What we're seeing and we've seen a long of as we keep track of these cohorts we see on the App start spending we see the spending profile very across customers. Your almost seems more excited about this iPhone launch versus historically because the sequential growth is better. I beyond the fact we probably shouldn't read every blog and every blog, think is different with this product launch or product availability cycle what you've historically?. Tim, growth in the smartphone market is now crawling along at about a single digit percentage. know iPhone grew about 2% year over and it like you about a mid-teens market share in units in. So as we forward maybe three to years, do you think Apple expand its market share?. And second question is just about India, general India in quarter. I do think that we can grow both units and market share. the developed markets the buyer rates down other than places like Japan perhaps, the emerging markets, we even gotten yet, really. a revenue point of we had very strong growth there. As you mentioned your second we've already an app center. That's on top working with the channel and at expanding our go-to-market in. began to produce the iPhone SE there during the quarter, and we're really happy with how going. see a lot of similarities to where China was several years. A replay of today's call will be for two as a podcast the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.",48.88,0.8041562438011169

We sold 5.4 million Macs during the September quarter, up over last year and gained significant market share as the global market contracted 1% based on IDC's latest. This performance was fueled primarily by great demand for MacBook Pro and Mac revenue grew 25% to a new September quarter record. outstanding results all around the world with of our geographic segments Mac revenue by 20% or. were also very happy with the success of Mac in education market where customer grew double digits year over. sold 10.3 million units, up 11% over last year with strong demand for both iPad and iPad Pro and revenue grew. was great to see iPad unit growth in all of our geographic segments and particularly strong results in emerging markets, including greater where iPad units sales were up 25% year-over-year and India,.

We paid $3.3 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $4.5 billion on repurchases of 29.1 million Apple through open market. We launched a new billion ASR resulting in initial delivery and of 15.1 million shares and we million upon the completion of our 11th ASR during. move ahead the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, includes types forward-looking information that Nancy referred to the beginning of call. And given it's likely to be not in the December quarter, should think a better than revenue quarter because of that X ramp?. ramp for iPhone X is especially considering that X is the advanced iPhone we've ever created and it has lots of new technologies in it. And in of March, we obviously guidance beyond the current quarter. then China growth returned to strong double digits, 12% up. You've talked historically about region being more sensitive than to form factor changes and iPhone X factor not available in September. And should we assume that growth that only accelerates from here as that new gets into the market. We market share for iPhone, Mac and iPad during the. We all-time revenue for Services and for Mac for the PRC during the. We had double digit in iPhone both the upgraders and Android switchers both a year over year the quarter, and so the results were broad. quarter in it affected us 1 percentage point. We don't provide guidance from our guidance, we think going to have a strong. Good afternoon and congrats on a strong quarter. never go through mix, I share with you that iPhone X orders are very strong for both direct customers and for channel which as you are lots of carriers throughout world. go through different countries as I've been lately, and looking at some things the market, other things that are coming, the very cool thing is they're all over place. They're going to be great for productivity and between small and large business. I see that makes want to K-12 and repeat my schooling in the classroom lot. course, Apple is the only company could have brought this and integration, and it requires sort of making lot â or giving operating system to many people at. And the software team worked really hard make versions of iPhone so that we of have hundreds millions of enabled overnight. so there's 1,000-plus in the App Store right now. I think this is very much like in when we fired the gun in the overall App. The Tim, can you talk a bit about how you're thinking terms of the lineup?. Perhaps that was just some of the switchers China maybe some of the growth China share. But how you sort thinking about what went into the guidance December quarter?. Are you really strong at the low end and obviously expected from the X the end?. In terms what we saw Q4, you can tell the ASP had success, I would through the different iPhones. And got some that are really great for that market. three new iPhones and people will look at these and decide which one they want. is the first we've been in the position that we've had new iPhones once like this at the top of the line. And to see what but we put our absolutely thinking that we here in the guidance Luca and you can tell from that, that we're bullish. And then in terms Services, $8.5 up can you about some of the portions of that that outperformed, sustainable?. terms of significant growth in Services, but I'm just. the growth rate for service in the was fantastic. It's the highest growth rate that had for services during 2017. I would highlight maybe three of these businesses within Services at the App Store set new all-time. The number of accounts to grow strongly, that's very, very important to us for the App Store. We're the highest rates that we've had since the launch the service. remember that a few years ago, were actually declining in Music; with streaming service in to download business, the business growing. And that really the growth rate the entire Services business. service that continues to grow very strong double digits, and that's also helping. Could comment upon your expectations in terms the mix forward?. And if you won't do that, perhaps could comment a bit about thinking in terms of price elasticity. years ago, nobody would've imagined selling a phone at this price and obviously, you're confident that you can do. If you look at 8 and Plus, when launched them, they instantly became top two products. If you look at 8 Plus in particular, to provide a little color there, the period of that we can to date, has gotten off fastest start of any model. before, we've had three products and it's only today that the first customers sort of look at all three of those and I'm there's been some that wanted to do that deciding even which one. in terms price elasticity, I think it's important to that a large pay for the phone by month. And so if you were to out on the U.S., that to be more of the of this call, you at the carriers, I you would you could buy an iPhone $33 a month. X a lot of great new technologies in that are leading the it is fabulous product and we can't wait for people to getting their hands. Now though, leading in AR, you're leading face ID, which all-in a year ago, as some of have suggested, was kind of very reminiscent of the aggressive Apple. Is it possible going forward you could accelerate share gains from Android because now in a stronger position?. little bit on that question, Tim. You talked a bit providing a lot of value and Apple sets its prices according to. I given the uniqueness of the product you with the X particular, that a lot sense. guess the question is given the uniqueness of the that have marketplace, shouldn't we â we, or shouldn't we gross margins improve cycle previous. And perhaps you can talk a little bit you think about pricing in the context gross margin. We that time we launch new products, the cost of the new tend to be than the that they. a very good track of taking those cost structures over the life cycle the product, we are able bring them. There of elements in the gross margin line that we good control over and there are also elements that we. Also, mix of products that we sell into the market tends change over time, and that also has impact on gross margin for company. to think maximizing gross margin because we the important thing for investors at the of the. track record over years, think we've found a good balance between unit grow and gross margins and will continue to do as we forward. I think a common question is, the iPhone X was made available. so I think the really significant question is that initial a function of uniquely strong demand versus history push-out a function of weaker versus history?. You have very talked about targeting when you think you could reach supply/demand balance. So be really helpful if you some context in terms what you know, either about initial about a supplies versus can help try and understand the little data points that they're seeing terms of of the. Until you all of them out there where customers the ability to demo and think any kind of mix discussion is very estimating. And I'll ask original question and follow-up at the same time because slightly different topics. believe, Tim, in your prepared I think, doubled year over year. upon analysis, it looks like Apple's just a relatively small sliver of the pie there. Are you more hardware sales services through the or where the excitement will then monetize it Apple?. of the things that you mentioned are correct. like India is a result of all of those and doing them all. there and understanding of the market, but still a long to go, which sort see as an opportunity instead of problem. you know, as I think we talked before, we manufacturing the iPhone there nine months so. the majority of the iPhone SEs we sold the domestic market quarter were there. bandwidth issue an issue, but as you point out, is addressed between the carriers there with and now investing the way service in is better it was just 12 months ago. In terms of the monetization question on AR/VR, we to focus first and on customer experience. that if we get the experience right, that and profits be result of getting right. Daryanani - Capital Markets LLC Luca, year over year revenues are going be high single digits at the midpoint, gross margin will be down a. As I mentioned, think to Toni, we have higher structures every launch products. is going to the offset, and I particularly the from the pricing environment is a headwind at this point. to size it for you, the impact of memory on our margin is bps sequentially and 110 a over year basis. guys about it a fair amount earlier, but even if you it looks the back of accelerated by 500 basis points in fiscal the first of. is there a way to think about much this is expanding base, which one of the you mentioned I more dollar per that you see?. I mentioned, particularly on the App Store, very important the number of accounts has grown lot. It's grown a lot because, as you said, the installed base grown, but also because made number of that have made it easier on the App Store be to on the App Store. We're also now, very recently, made some changes, as you have seen, to the design of the App Store. And so people now are spending more time on the they more apps, and that over time translates into monetization. Tim, I'm wondering if we a look at mainland China and we think 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, they've been for a while now. What has been the just response to those two new iPhones and preorders around the in mainland China?. In terms of preorder process works in China in the so not in our direct but in the broader channel and channel, they take indications of interest versus something I label a preorder. If the past five years, sales were up 7% in the September so that's average. Yet didn't have your iPhones in market. performance during the quarter was very. And so we just had a phenomenal quarter iPad, on the Mac, on Services, on iPhone. so that's what, our new give us great confidence headed into this holiday season this is going be season yet.",59.26,0.7650588750839233

It is our fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth. know, December quarter a ago 14-weeks compared to 13-weeks which important to consider as we assess the underlying performance of business year. When we look average revenue per week, our growth rate was even higher at with growth all product categories for the third quarter. In Greater China, very happy to generate double digit revenue growth the quarter in row and in emerging markets outside of Greater 25% year-over-year growth. net was $20.1 billion an all-time record, and $2.2 billion over the last year. Diluted earnings per share also an all-time record and cash flow was strong of $28.3 billion.

We established iPhone revenue record in nearly every market track with double-digit growth in all of our geographic. ASP increased to $796 from $695 year ago, driven primarily by launch of iPhone X and the and 8 Plus. We exited the December quarter towards lower end of our target range of five seven weeks of channel inventory with less than 1 million more iPhones in the channel compared to the year in line with growth in average unit. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very, very strong for both consumers and business users. The latest data from 451 Research indicates U.S. customer satisfaction ratings of 96% or higher across iPhone models. And among business customers planning to purchase in the next quarter, 77% planned to purchase iPhone. Our are also incredibly loyal with Comcast latest U.S. research, reflecting a 96% iPhone loyalty rate, the ever. We had terrific quarter revenue of $8.5 billion, up 18% and up of average revenue per week; that an acceleration that we experienced in the. The Storeâs all-new design is off to a fantastic start with quarterly store visitors, transacting accounts reaching new. the week beginning December 24th, a record number of customers made purchases downloaded Apps from the App Store, spending $890 million in that seven-day period, followed by million in Yearâs alone. And according to App latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer by a very wide margin, nearly twice the revenue of Google. Across all our services offerings, paid subscriptions reached $240 million with 58% over last year and they were a major contributor to the overall strong growth services revenue. As Tim mentioned, it was our quarter ever for Apple Watch. fact, wearables were the second largest contributor to revenue iPhone, which is impressive for a business that only three years ago. total, other products category set a new all-time record with quarterly revenue exceeding $5 billion for first time. We sold 5.1 million Macs during the December quarter, which to 2% increase in average sales per. performance was particularly strong in emerging markets with unit sales up 13% year-over-year and in Latin America, in India, Turkey and Central Eastern Europe. On a worldwide basis, of Macs was up double-digits year-over-year to a new.

The active install base of iPad has grown every quarter since its launch in 2010, and it reached a new high in thanks extremely high customer loyalty and large numbers of first-time iPad users. indicates that iPad had 46% share of the tablet market in the quarter, up from share year ago. And the most recent surveys from 451 tablets within 90 days, 72% of and 68% of business users planned to iPads. Customer satisfaction is also very high with businesses reporting a satisfaction for iPad. We are seeing great in enterprise as businesses across industries and around the world standardize on. Weâre also rolling out a new initiative, called Apple at Work to help businesses implement employee choice programs more easily and offer Apple products. Resources from both Apple and our channel partners will enable enterprise IT and procurement to buy or lease Apple products more efficiently, streamline the setup of iPhone, iPad, and and deliver seamless onboarding experience for employees. the program with CDW in the U.S. last week, we would be expanding more channels and regions this. The December quarter was extremely busy for our retail online stores, which welcomed 538 million visitors. was particularly strong during the four-weeks following the of iPhone up 46% over last year. And across the quarter, our stores conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple sessions, covering topics including music, and app and and design. We ended the quarter with $285.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase $16.2. We $7 billion debt during the quarter, bringing us to $110 billion in term-debt and $12 in commercial of billion at the end of the. We returned $14.5 billion to investors during the. We paid $3.3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and spent $5.1 billion on repurchases of 30.2 million Apple through open market. We a new $5 ASR program, in initial delivery and retirement 23.6 million shares and we retired 3.8 million shares the completion of our 12th ASR during the. Due to the recently legislation in the we estimate making a corporate income tax payment of approximately $38 billion the government on our cumulative foreign earnings. $38 billion payment, we will have paid over $110 of corporate income tax on our domestic and foreign earnings during the last years a tax rate of 26%. Our tax rate of 25.8% the December quarter close to guidance of 25.5% as the U.S. statutory new legislation effectively offset the remeasurement of deferred tax. given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the to our cash, we targeting to become approximately net cash over time. provide an update our specific capital allocation when we report results for second fiscal quarter, with the timing of updates we have in the. Luca, I wanted to a little bit about, more about your comments on structure. I you don't want any specifics about what you're actually going to return the timing. But maybe can talk cash you think you need to here on the business?. Of course, been talking importance tax reform over the years, because we believe beneficial to U.S. economy. As I said we be discussing capital allocation plans when we our March results. And when you at our track record of weâve done over last several years, youâve seen that effectively were returning to investors essentially about of our cash flow. And then, maybe could you talk a little bit youâre hearing from customers terms the iPhone demand. thinking the decay rate, for lack of a better term, with the high-end phones and over $1,000 phone that with now your ability to ship phones down below because youâve expanded the product line much when you your phones in. iPhone across all the geographic segments was in the double-digits. think as Luca said earlier, when you change that an average weekly sales basis, 22%. iPhone X was the most popular and thatâs particularly noteworthy given didnât start shipping until early for a while. The most important thing is that the number, itâs customer satisfaction. customer satisfaction is off the charts on iPhone X. the the overall iPhone line to get to the essence of the question, think. In Urban China and the U.S., the top smartphones quarter were all iPhones. double-digits of a large revenue base is. But if look March guidance, it does assume slower growth in total revenue, as well as, I think on my math, iPhone when you compare it to December quarter. So just how we read into a slowdown in average growth as relates to the last question around the decay demand higher. So when you put things in perspective and you of growth we had in quarter and the $7 billion $9 billion that guiding to the second quarter, you're talking $17 to $19 billion of growth six. typically go into this level of but think it's important this quarter to give you additional. And maybe two most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double as compared to last year, during March quarter. And also importantly that iPhone sell-through growth a year-over-year will be actually accelerating during March quarter as to the. Let explain the factors that we took into consideration we came up our iPhone units and that are in guidance. Historically, because the channel fill and the season, our selling during the quarter is generally than sell-through. This year, difference was further magnified, because we shipped X in November than September quarter. We were able to reach supply/demand balance in placed the entirety of our channel fill for iPhone X Q1 and will have an effect on both units. We typically reduced channel for our newest iPhones in Q2, because they very large demand the weeks of sales, which are by the holiday season in. know, products this year have a higher ASP than they in past. so as result, as we reduce inventories of these newest products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in will naturally sequentially by a percentage than we. in summary, our guidance for iPhone; we got double digit year-over-year growth of sell-through growth a year-over-year basis. For the of the Company, in the aggregate, we expect to grow strong year-over-year and particularly performance in service in like weâve during the quarter. And so you can just comment how you that flows over the next of the weaker dollar. Certainly, weaker dollar in the long term, it will be a positive but it's not something going be seeing translating gross margin tailwind quickly. We also to keep in mind that we to experience a difficult we think is going to start improving as we the second half of our fiscal. When think conceptually about the path for X Style devices forward. Is there any reason the roadmap wouldnât consists of multiple devices as weâve with past iPhone upgrades?. In other words, the 10 was unique amongst iPhone launches, because it's a device, potentially limiting the shots on for given limited options. I think at the we really comment on future products. And then how you're about AR beyond iPhone?. do see Apple as a provider of a larger ecosystem of AR-enabled beyond coming years?. We a lot of energy on AR removing very. commented on how your install based the last couple years has grown. iPhone largest of and so iPhone base is probably growing close to number perhaps last, it 20% through 25%. Yet, if we look at iPhone unit growth for fiscal whatâs implied with your guidance fiscal â17 and fiscal â16, itâs relatively flat. have an base thatâs 20% plus higher, and unit growth that relatively flat, which would suggest that your your elongating. Isnât also something that investors potentially be concerned about in terms of its impact upgrade rate going forward?. up investors to what they to focus on, so I want to put myself in the position that. The or the previously owned market has expanded in over the years. would like to point out that the ever year major product a high on the active install. thatâs iPad, itâs Mac and those are huge numbers as well. And so weâve always said, there is a large part of -- or the majority of services are mapped to base instead of sales. We it because we thought it thing do for our customers. that we should think about the tax rate an ongoing basis?. And just back to you on your response, Tim, guess maybe you just comment on whether you believe upgrade rate has decreased over last of years, because just base growing 20 units relatively flat that period. Isn't install -- upgrade rate is going down, or I not about other. And I think we're going be receiving, over the next few months, guidance. taken provisional estimates coming with our tax entries the quarter, we will have do that as we go forward here during the year. that for the current fiscal year, the that we for Q2 should approximately you should seeing. get into fiscal year, so many things change we need to that into account, the mix of our products and on. I think on the cycle, Toni, the answer is, probably looks different by. love the 1.3 billion you us, updating from two years ago. I think you're asking, are more active users today than there were two years ago when we 1 billion active. Weâre not releasing a user we think that the proper look it is to look at active. It is so this product cycle, particularly with the iPhone only starting in that we do not feel we have at this point that be very share. that this doesn't look like a super-cycle in of unit growth, you to focus on the size of the the here?. is important, think active devices are hugely important that's reason that the number two ago, and reason weâre that today. That speaks to strength the product loyalty the customer, strength of the ecosystem. so we do put a lot of behind that. So I have long believed that on 90 day clock on unit sales is surface way to Apple. think that the far bigger thing is look over a longer period of time. satisfaction and engagement and number of active devices are all part of that. HomePod is an incredible that a unbelievable audio experience in a very small form factor a digital assistant in Siri an enormous of music. further, because we think do right from home app instead of seeing. It also, obviously, also do things with HomePod like use it a speaker phone. And so I think the cases on this much like our will broad based. people will it significantly for music others may use it significantly for as a assistance; I think the majority will use all of it and use all the functionality of it. think double-digit year-over-year but essentially in line to what saw in. would have thought that would have accelerated a little bit with iPhone X. And so though reporting similar year-over-year growth for Greater China, if you change that reporting to average weekly which is much better way to look at it, there a really nice acceleration. this quarter as reported are 11% increase for Greater China year-over-year but on average weekly revenue we up 19%. Also Mainland China, we had an all-time for in Mainland China. And as Iâve mentioned before, Kantar reported that the top smartphones in urban China were. And you look at the other -- we obviously share for iPhone in the quarter, but we grew share iPad and Mac during the quarter wearables were strong there the quarter. you talked about reducing Apple's net cash levels to effectively over that implies -- the number goes from $163 billion today to something zero. And does this change your thoughts M&A at all, one reason to get that number $163 billion to zero. And the thought process is always to something that allows us to accelerate our product filling in our portfolio, new experience customers. I said, we will talk about capital allocation plans when we report the March and that will include talking about timeframes pace so on.",48.98,0.8156515955924988

Given our confidence in Apple's future the value that we see in our stock, our has a $100 billion repurchase program we will start executing during the quarter. Considering the unprecedented size this new authorization, we want be particularly and flexible in our approach to shares. As in the past, will provide regular updates our capital return activities at end every quarter. With over $13 billion in annual dividend payments, we proud to among the largest dividend in the world and to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. We will to review our allocation taking into the needs of our business, our opportunities, and our financial. expect to provide a new update to capital allocation plans approximately 12 months from. move ahead the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook includes types forward-looking information that Nancy referred to the beginning of call. wanted ask about thoughts on sort of iPhone and we're a couple of quarters from launch of the iPhone. $1,000 price point, and it's clearly but been a lot of questions in the market about sustainability of that point and how as you sort of holistically across lineup. And so with customer set that Luca as well, the 99%, iPhone X a beloved product. that one of those things where a team wins the Super Bowl, maybe you by a few more points but it's Super winner we about it. then, can you talk a bit about working capital, specifically inventory which pretty significantly quarter-over-quarter?. and how are you thinking I mean, it's one uses obviously, so how you inventory maybe working general as going forward?. Yeah, Shannon, you know that we've always generated significant amount of cash working capital. have decided some purchasing decision, given current market conditions, and that should unwind over. acceleration is really this quarter in my mind. talk about what the biggest drivers, it be or regions that the acceleration and do you think we can continue see growth north 30%?. each of the geos did extremely well and set records from App Store to Apple Music to iCloud to Pay and more. And that, if look at the subscriptions, the number of think I this in my comments, paid subscriptions moved over a year-over-year basis over million by end of the quarter. of forward, we've obviously made assumption our guidance that Luca earlier and in of longer term, we're on target to our 2020 of the services revenue as we had talked about previously. But anecdotally that you see in the business in would suggest that that is having impact that Apple taking as a company preempt any of tariffs going forward?. And think there's lots of things that bind the countries together and very optimistic. And so that's I'm optimistic that â I don't know every play that happen, over time, I think view will prevail. Will it be continued penetration of and Pay as kind of the largest future categories of growth?. And I think the good news that because our active installed base is such a level, last quarter said that we exceeded billion. year not going to release this number every but we've obviously grown again. that of change in the installed and with the services others that we working on, I this just a opportunity for us and very good about that. then any potential tariff issues aside, what's working for Apple in China right now?. You talked about it being the in 10 quarters. iPhone X was the popular smartphone in all China last quarter. order to hit a number on the growth you see your data there, there has to be several things working. the growth rates there are the other products category, which our wearables business in China the services business, which you and just about. I first one, just touching on gross margin if I look at the guidance for June on a basis, I sales are up digit but gross are still the high end, down 20 at the. Can you just talk about the lack of leverage on a gross basis on a year-over-year basis June?. But in general, I would say that year we are seeing a more environment, particularly we're still dealing with about 70 basis from the pricing environment we're working through. you've been fairly vocal I think talking about the for better privacy and well-crafted regulation over time. Could you just maybe help us understand, does protect data?. how does this ongoing debate around data protection translate into a positive Apple over time?. Because if look at our model, if we can convince you to buy iPhone or iPad, we'll a little of money. Luca, could talk a bit more about capital allocation?. dividend increase of 16% relatively to what you could have so are you really thinking the stock price is attractive here?. Can you give us any timeframe of billion and how much debt do you about in terms net zero?. when come down capital allocation decisions, we obviously also in mind opportunity for us to M&A activities which we in ongoing basis. But it comes down dividends our view is that for of we see a lot of value the stock. As seen from our track during the last five years, we do it a very fast but we also to do it efficiently. And so that in mind, we have of repurchases during the March quarter. We will you an our at end of every quarter then 12 months from now will actually about an the entire. merely selling time or do you think more broadly it?. Yes, Tim, I think there is China are actually the quarter third consecutive of growth. there's a lot of concerns just Apple in China and maybe misinformation out there. we continue to put great energy and try to â our objective over is to go there with different initiatives from retail and else. It's a huge market it's clear that many people be moving into the middle class time, we've seen in other. China, I continue to believe is a phenomenal country opportunity from a market point of view, but lots of opportunity from app developer point view. So we China holistically, not only as market. On market side, we've seen I had being the top smartphone during quarter. on any kind of, on a 90-day different things can happen. my personal view China is it's a great market, and are certainly looking beyond 90 days and on the opportunity and the there. Tim, you comment on price elasticity of demand at the end for iPhones, if that in line your expectations?. We for the value that delivering, and iPhone X is the innovative on the. Tim. your gross margins have been robust despite headwinds that you absorbed on commodities, you frankly, also FX that somewhat FX upside that a lot of other are seeing. said earlier this year, I we are experiencing in total a more difficult cost environment and so that turn into a positive us. At the time, it's very difficult me give you an indication of what is going to in the future cycle is as you don't provide past the quarter. And the mix of products and services that we sell our customers has an impact on the overall margin. actually both my at the same time, one Tim one for Luca. Tim, when we to investors they often say, oh, market is saturated. Yet we do our analysis, we kind of still see emerging markets like and those are growth. you think about and those markets, do kind of believe that some of those markets could get to much higher a market share have in some of the developing time?. And then, Luca, on the for you, about the gross margin. When we about if component prices start to stabilize, seeing how Apple services been so successful and accretive to start to look some potential margin, gross margin stabilize?. In terms of â let me address the market bit and I'll mention iPhone. of the market in general, if you at last year, is the data point we on full market, there were 0.5 billion feature phones in the world. And we believe that over time every phone sold will be smartphone. In terms of the itself, even though we sell a phones across the of a year, market share globally compared to the â sales low compared to the market of smartphones. think that India, India is third largest smartphone market in the. There's obviously opportunities there for us, and have low share in that overall. And so putting a lot of energy there working with carriers in that and they're networks. And so do â I buy view market's saturated. don't see that a market point of view or â and certainly not from an of. market sort of like the market for consumer product company in the history of the and â but how I about. gross margin think I'll repeat I said earlier, but you're right. Our services business, and I've said it in past, is accretive to company. And so as we are able grow the business, that should provide positive, a tailwind. At same the services portfolio that have, we have services that of profitability, so we also to take account mix of services we're going to selling. At macro level, because about of is outside the States, a weak dollar is a positive for our margins; a strong as it's been during the four has a bit of a headwind for the. general, we look at our process to innovate our products, when we launch a that product to have a cost structure the product it replaces. so that is something that we need to work through every time launch product and we have a good track record and history cost structures down over time. done a pretty remarkable job several years at managing all coming out with a level of that we think is good for investors and certainly it our plan to to manage.",47.05,0.8012688755989075

Our year-over-year performance was impacted by different timing of the MacBook Pro which not occur until early Q4 this year as opposed to last year, with subsequent channel fill during the June. with a difficult launch comparison, we saw great momentum in many emerging markets, with growth well double digits and we new June quarter records sales in India, Chile and Central and Eastern. iPad unit sales grew the fifth consecutive quarter and gained significant share of global tablet market based the latest estimates from IDC. We recorded double digit iPad unit growth in both our Greater China and rest of Asia segments with a June quarter record for iPad sales in Mainland. Almost half of iPad purchases in the quarter were by new to iPad and our active base iPads reached a new all-time high. overall performance compared to last year was impacted by the introduction new iPad Pro models in June of year which resulted in both a with ASPs and channel sale a year. indicates that iPad has 60% share of the tablet market in the quarter, up from share year ago. And the most recent consumer survey from Research measured iPad customer satisfaction of 94%, and among plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to iPads. For example, financial services institutions are increasingly using iPads to deploy digital signature solutions for customer consent, compliance requirements, account openings and services transactions. In the railway industry, businesses around the world are using iPhone and iPad support training, passenger engagement and activities. global automotive companies are deploying iPads in for sales enablement and end-to-end customer service management and are choosing iPhone as the standard mobile device their employees around the world. More and more companies are giving their teams a choice when it comes to the they at and enterprises Salesforce and Capital One deploying Macs based on employee preference. In fact, at Salesforce, the majority of their 35,000 employees are using Macs and companies tell us that has instrumental them retain talent while providing strong streamlined deployment, and significantly total cost of ownership. We're also seeing great interest in Business Chat, our new way for organizations to connect with customers. Business Chat lets customers answers to resolve issues and complete transactions directly from within Messages by starting a conversation on their iPhone or iPad and even continue the conversation on their Mac or Apple Watch. can reach a live agent with their questions, make account changes, an or order a pay-per-view movie sporting event, all without leaving the Messages conversation. Fans simply use their iPhone camera to scan QR code the back their seats taking them directly to Business conversation in Messages. Our retail and online stores had a great thanks to very strong growth from iPhone, AirPods and Watch and the expansion of to Canada, France and. Our stores hosted more than 250,000 our very successful Today at Apple sessions. We continue to add content across all Today at Apple topics including popular new sessions on music and. We our 50th retail store Greater China during the quarter we just a beautiful new store in Milan this the number stores located outside the U.S. to 46% the. We ended the quarter with $243.7 billion in cash marketable. move ahead the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook includes types forward-looking information that Nancy referred to the beginning of call. As you recall, our September quarter results last year included a one-time favorable adjustment of $640 to our revenue. our revenue guidance implies year-over-year of about 16% to 19%. You're on track to hit services revenue even earlier than planned, so how thinking next of services growth as you move into next three to five years?. the next leg of this, given the that we're seeing board, we feel about our current but we're also thrilled about our that some new services it as well. Katy, margins, let me tell you about the puts and for the June quarter, then I'll about the guidance for and some observations for the future. year we were able to offset that with some improvements and also we had some in foreign exchange on sequential basis. you know, we have what we call product transition costs during the year we also have about bps of headwind from foreign again because the has recently. those be offset by positive because you've the revenue guidance we provided and the mix to services that you've actually mentioned your. Looking forward, you know we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter, but think we have pretty last several years make good business decisions, units, and margins. has a significant for the last 12, 18 months the June quarter was a negative. Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. that had about nine months of experience with a high-end fully featured you talk a about what you think customers the elasticity of demand is and how you're sort of thinking position?. And if you, and look iPhone X in particular, it's the most innovative on the market. And I think in this learned that customers innovative we sort of already knew that in other cycles other points in times, it just puts an exclamation by I with looking results. If you look at on a geographic basis, top three selling phones in urban China were number for a couple of quarters, and iPhones make up three of top five smartphones UK Japan. it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's happening in the market, but given the industry we've it's we picked global market share picked up market share in several countries, not only but. can you talk a bit about China, Greater China up 19% year-over-year during quarter, I believe?. Obviously iPhone doing well, but concern that maybe some of what's on in the trade world might have impacted. I'm just curious as to what you're seeing in China and how you're as you look forward. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that had double digit growth Greater China. of tariffs themselves, maybe I could sort of take a step some people have questions on this. And our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up in lower economic significant risk of consequences. the have been imposed have the comment period think one that's exiting today â there have been those I can walk those briefly just to make sure everybody is the same page. been two other that have totaled about $50 billion of goods from China that have either implemented or the comment period in this month. There is a fourth tariff which includes goods valued at $200 billion, also focused on that are imported. Probably else, we're evaluating one and we'll be sharing views it with administration and so forth comment period for that one ends. Maybe they're related to data and this sort thing and so we're through that now and we'll be sharing our results on those and feeding back public comment. I'm wondering if you could talk a bit about the multi-year partnership with Oprah Winfrey and what says about your original content strategy also Apple Music. you give a little more colors or an update maybe around paid subscribers total around Apple Music and how feel that's out. the sort of the key catalysts and the changes, the cord view only going to and accelerate at a faster rate is widely thought. We're seeing the things that have on the periphery of this like Apple TV, units and revenue grew very strong strong double in Q3. As I in my opening comments, we're seeing providers up the Apple TV use it as their box to go to with their service. 300 million-plus paid subscriptions, of these are third party video subscriptions and we see the growth there. In terms of Apple Music, we're well over 50 million listeners now you add paid subscribers and folks the and so we're a very, very good rate. is to grow the market, because if you everyone up that's providing subscription music today streaming music, it's, of China, it's than 200 probably around world. does seem to there's an extraordinary business to grow the market and think if put our emphasis which we're doing, be a of as other people will as well. Our revenues Music grew over 50% I'd mentioned earlier during the quarter, and so some really, really strong. Luca, I'm wondering as we think about modeling Q4, iPhone ASPs are typically up sequentially about 2% to of low single digits. I know you provided quarter on how we should be thinking Q3 ASPs. Inc. Toni, as you know, we do not provide guidance for units or ASPs for any product category, but of course we provided guidance on revenue and the range implies growth of 16% to. the growth come from growth from iPhone, from services from wearables, which has been a bit of our pattern during the course the. On iPhone the only that I would point out is June quarter a significantly higher level than in the past and that to keep in we move the September quarter. It's to keep in mind the type of revenue that we've implied in our guidance. actually best the world to be in for that is in business we're. revenues are up for the quarter over last year. about doing for the user and I think the users the customers then have business over and so that's how we'd look at that. I think the home Laura, is bigger than the HomePod and Apple TV. They're both important clearly, but everybody has their iPhone home well and has their Mac home everyone has their iPad at home. And so in terms of access point, as you can tell from 100 billion I quoted the script, there's extraordinary amount of of these products that used to perform home-related functions. that but part of it is the Apple Watch the the iPad, and so is important. A lot people that buy Apple products buy for the whole ecosystem, though they might not currently all the different products. And there's the have really gone through the roof and the Apple Watch has hit an air pocket has to a different level I'd mentioned earlier with our wearables revenue. It is, but on your point though, it is clear from I've had with users that some of attracted to because of the Apple Watch.",44.92,0.7495515942573547

We are headed into the with our product lineup ever, and we not be bullish about Apple's. We are pleased to report record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, year in which we saw double-digit revenue in every segment and new revenue and earnings records in. Revenue in the quarter was $62.9 billion, up and more than $10 billion over last with strong growth in each of our geographic segments and record in in Europe, and the of Asia-Pacific. In fact, we new revenue records in almost every market we track, with especially strong growth Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, Korea, all major markets where revenue growth was or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue records for iPhone and wearables and new all-time records for services and.

And among business buyers who plan to smartphones in the December quarter, plan to purchase iPhones. Turning to services, it was our quarter ever in total and virtually in every market around the with of $10. A year ago, we had a one-time $640 million favorable impact to accounting adjustment. account, our services growth Q4 this was 27%. Tim mentioned, we reached new quarterly revenue records many services categories, we are our way to achieve our goal to double our fiscal 2016 revenue by 2020. In fact, 30,000 subscription apps are available on the App Store today, the largest of them represents less 0.3% of our total. We saw great response to our new MacBook Pro models that we launched in July, with strong revenue growth driving an all quarterly record for Mac. were especially pleased with Mac momentum in emerging with strong growth in Latin America, in India, the Middle and Africa, and Central and Eastern. At over 100 units, our installed base of Macs is at all-time high, and majority customers purchasing Macs in the quarter were new to. We sold 9.7 million during the quarter, share in nearly every market we track, on the latest estimates from. We generated iPad growth in a of key regions the world, including Latin India, and South.

In fact, over 450 airlines and 47 of the top 50 world have adopted iOS to help pilots fly saver, more efficient flights and many airlines also using iOS support. We're also making great strides in the retail sector, where 9 of the top global retailers use iOS devices transform their customer and employee experiences. Deployment of iOS devices is growing steadily as retailers replace their traditional point-of-sale systems and use custom iOS on iPhones and iPads to highly personalized shopping experiences. Additionally, earlier in the year introduced two new technology offerings. IBM Watson services for Core ML, and the IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple that are enabling businesses to learning and cloud for a new of dynamic smart apps made for iOS. In our new partnership with Salesforce, excited bring together the number one customer relationship management platform iOS. Together with Apple, Salesforce is redesigning its apps to embrace a native mobile with exclusive new features on iOS. The companies will also provide tools and resources for millions of developers to build their own native with a new Salesforce mobile for iOS. And finally, we recently announced Apple Business Manager, a new way for IT teams to deploy Apple at scale. We ended the quarter with $237.1 billion in cash marketable. explained earlier this year, it is our plan to cash neutral position over time.

For our year 2018, revenue grew over $36 billion to $265.6 billion, an record. Every geographic segment grew double digits with records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia-Pacific. also set new all-time records for net income, up 23% versus last year, and EPS up. And we returned a total of almost $90 billion to our investors during the year, including $14 billion dividends and equivalents and over $73 billion in repurchases. Before we discuss December outlook, I'd like to describe a of changes in as we enter new year. First, given increasing importance of our services business and in order to provide our financial results, we start reporting as well as cost of both total products total services beginning December quarter. Second, also beginning in this December we're adopting the FASB's new standard for revenue recognition. This will not result in any change our revenue, it will the way we the classification of revenue between products and services. After adopting the new standard, this revenue will now be reported services revenue. After we our 10-K, will post a schedule to our Investor Relations website showing the reclassification 2018 revenue from to services in adoption the standard. for clarity, this reclassification was contemplated in our previously stated of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020. That remains unchanged and excludes the revenue that is now shifting products to services over that timeframe. Third, starting with the December quarter, we will no longer be providing unit data for iPad and Mac. As we have stated many times, our is to make great products and services that and provide an unparalleled customer experience so our are highly satisfied, loyal engaged. As by our financial in recent years, the number of units sold in any 90-day period necessarily representative of the underlying of our business. a unit of sale is less relevant for today than was in past, given breadth portfolio and wider sales price dispersion within any. Fourth, starting the December quarter, we will renaming the other products category to wearables, home, and accessories to provide a more accurate of items are included this product category. move ahead the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, includes types forward-looking information that Nancy referred to the beginning of call. We have the strongest lineup ever as we enter the season and we revenue to be between $89 and billion, a all-time. we considered the effect on Q4 Q1 of the timing of our new this versus year. Third, we have an unprecedented number ramping, and while our ramps going fairly well, we have around balance. we'd ask that you limit yourself to questions. Tim, there has some deceleration in some of these emerging markets, by some concerns around some of rules administration contemplating partly driven things that are more specific China, like some of the regulations around gaming. can about how you see the trajectory there for the business and what you think of the initiatives some Netflix and Fortnite to bypass the Store subscriptions and I a follow-up. in us raising prices and those markets are not growing way we would like to see. think, at least the way that I see of emerging markets has a bit story, and don't sort that common between those for most part. other products category was also stronger, in fact, a bit stronger than the overall company. The App Store in China, we have seen a slowdown or a moratorium, accurate, on new game approvals. is regulatory setup in China, and there things are not moving the way they were. of larger developers, if step back and at the value proposition for from the App Store, there two key constituencies in that equation. If you start with the user, what the App people is the best safest place users to apps. And it is not perfect, we wind reviewing over 100,000 apps per week between new apps and updates for existing and then work developers quickly to the issues. And we also provide the a one-payment model purchasing apps and and et cetera, so that they are that they have to information across companies. do a amount of marketing for developers, including the new Editorial that we started in the past months, personal recommendations, search tools, and so on forth. And so itself is nearly as broad as the App Store itself is, and so that's value proposition. I could just ask you really quick on in healthcare, been growing significantly the early introduction in the Watch and then the kits including CareKit, cetera. And when you that with your very staunch advocacy for privacy, see Apple become a really large disintermediating in the friction in healthcare industry today in medical is and distributed. Is this the way that see future for Apple in healthcare?. And you see a means to also grow your services business through healthcare offerings that could your customers?. from our past several years that have an interest in the adding products and services, services, so far that. $4 billion range revenue that you're giving the quarter all the things that are the world right can you maybe give little about the variables you took into when you were coming up this?. At the level, we started the fact that we are very, about of and services we have into the season. And our guidance range, by the way, represents new all-time quarterly record. The first one fact that the launch timing the new this year is essentially in reverse versus year, that has an effect on will effect on Q1. So it's important keep that mind as you look at the revenue provided. And we look at the impact of foreign exchange our revenue December quarter, we're looking at 200 basis points translates, given the size our business, to almost $2 of headwind our revenue. The third point that I it's to keep in and Tim about this, we are launching, in the six weeks, we've of new products. then finally, that we've taken into account is what Tim's talked about in terms of some of uncertainty at the level in emerging markets where confidence is not as it 12 months ago. I understand you guidance because of 90 days is a short period time and it can fluctuate, but kind of do you think be to provide?. obviously have spent the last however many years going times Q. As said, right, our objective is to great products, provide the best experience, and get our customer engaged loyal to ecosystem. When look at our performance in recent years, take the last three years, for example, the during any quarter not been necessarily representative of the strength of business. I know you're aware, by the way, our top competitors in smartphones, in tablets, in do provide quarterly unit sales either. course understand that this is something of interest and when we believe that qualitative on unit sales offers investors, will do. Looking at one just for clarity is, Shannon, our intention to continue to give revenue guidance at company level and gross margin guidance in other that been providing so that our isn't changing. With staggered iPhone launch, were able to discern any impact on the and XS Max buyers potentially waiting for the XR, what if anything can we take away from guidance related to what you're early demand of XR?. Got it, you mentioned record levels for various components the business. As we if of services to maintain something close to the recent pace, the components of that you're particularly excited about could drive that be the drivers?. And maybe an offshoot to that, it seems like the news flow around reality has a little bit months. we said, during the quarter, we set new records for many, services categories, right, from Apple Music to services to the App Store to AppleCare and Pay really an exponential right now. we look at our services business, the that we a very and growing base. installed base of all our major categories is an all-time has been growing the last several quarters, so the opportunity us monetize our services continues to grow over time. Of we're also improving the of the services we provide and you look back the last years, we've new services to our portfolio. clearly, we want to continue to new services over time, so there of vectors that allow us to continue to the over time. stated that we double the size of the services from the that we 2016 by. number developers that either have done something, or even more case, that are working on things that I've seen are growing. There's a of interest out there and the number of categories that I'm seeing from to I was in China ago and saw in art sense, in an art. We content from Japan to Korea to many countries, and we have great content from as well, and so there are many hands in the. And so, think that that basic model where look around world and find the in different areas, don't expect model to go out style, to speak. Memory on sequential basis about 30 basis points favorable going into the December quarter. And obviously, going to benefiting from the leverage, which typical of our seasonality the December quarter. And of course, this point in the we have structures because, as I said, we've so new products in the last six. the puts and leverage and commodity side and FX and the new products other side. Thank you very much, a question for Tim and for Luca, and I'll ask them at the same time, so you second. But operationally, Tim, I think is at a disadvantage relative to others in India, giving where items are produced versus shipped versus taxed as to own stores. India to potentially be a big area, as I think you got about only 1% share, but it sounded things may be softer there?. And then for Luca, there will probably be a lot about not giving iPhone unit data. really great discussions with Indian government, and I expect that at point, they agree to allow to bring our stores the country. And this will the first time going provide gross margin for our services business, which we important metric our investors to follow. on why we do not believe that providing unit relevant our company this point, I can you that it is our objective to unit sales for product category that have. I a unit of sale is less relevant today than. But the end of day, make our a standpoint to try and optimize revenue and gross margin that we think is the that in best interest our investors. installed base is growing at double digit, and that's a more significant metric for us from point of view and the loyalty, et cetera. this is a little like if you go to market and you your up to cashier and says, or he says how have in there?.",49.38,0.5311099290847778
14,apple,q1,2019," Good day and welcome to the Apple Incorporated First Quarter Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. first today is Apple Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross expenses, income and expense, taxes, allocation, business outlook. For more information, refer to the Risk discussed in Apple's most filed periodic reports 10-Q, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC along with the Associated Press release. the first you've heard us the December quarter, so the first thing I want do is provide results connect those back the we shared the beginning the month. As you know, our December quarter revenue below our original expectations, coming at billion. We noted four factors that would impact our results when we provided guidance in November: different iPhone launch timing from a year FX headwinds, constraints on products and conditions in emerging. Our revenue there was down by $4.8 billion from last year with declines and. Most of the shortfall to our guidance and over 100% our worldwide revenue decline was by our performance Greater China. Despite iPhone upgrades being lower we anticipated, our business grew outside China, new records in the Americas, Western Europe, Central and Europe our rest of Asia Pacific segment. we shared earlier this month, said are proud to participate the Chinese marketplace believe business a bright there time. We generated record December quarter services revenue in Greater fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5 million registered iOS. very strong results from our wearables there with revenues up over. We also continued to grow our total active base by adding new. fact, than two-thirds of all customers in China bought a or an iPad during December were purchasing that product for the first time. Finally, for perspective, the challenging December quarter, our revenue China grew slightly the full calendar year. Macroeconomic and go, but we see great upside in continuing to on the things that we can control. Returning to iPhone, I'd like to talk our results the context of those lower than expected. customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer in past. you pair this with factors, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue that down from year. Our iPhone results accounted significantly more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. It's important what's going on the customer perspective at the point of purchase. Turkey, example, the lira depreciated by 33% the course calendar 2018 in the December quarter, down by almost $700 from the previous year. In Japan, for example, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contracts. result, we estimate that less than half of iPhones sold in Japan in Q1 of this year were subsidized compared about quarters a ago that the total value of those had down as. For millions of customers, we it inexpensive and efficient replace the battery and hold their iPhones a bit longer. Not only is large and installed base powerful testament to the and loyalty of our but it's also fueling Services business. fact Services revenue an all-time record at $10.9 billion the December quarter growing 19%. We not only generated our highest revenue ever, but we also had records across multiple categories of Services including App Store, Apple Pay, cloud services and our business and we had a quarter record for. And I'm very proud to say nearly 16 years after launching iTunes Store, generated our highest quarterly revenue thanks to great popularity of Apple Music with over 50 subscribers. App Store wrapped up its best ever with record holiday period results propelled the biggest Day and Christmas week ever. Customers also spent over $322 Year's Day alone setting new single-day record for both the number of and purchase volume. It was a great season for Apple Pay over 1.8 billion transactions the quarter well over twice the volume of. can now use Apple Pay with iPhone and Apple Watch at nearly 3,000 Speedway locations, while all Target Taco Bell and Jack-in-the-Box stores will be accepting Pay soon. Apple Pay in three new in the December quarter Germany, Belgium and Kazakhstan is now live in 27 markets around the. rollout Germany has been a huge with Deutsche Bank reporting more activations for Apple Pay in one week than in an entire year. is yet another example what's possible when you bring together Apple's world-class hardware, ecosystem with our engaged active user base. Revenue from services continues to grow rapidly with year-over-year revenue up over 40% in the December quarter. And readership of News set new with over 85 monthly active users in the three where we've launched the United States, the U.K., and Australia.

Following the launch of new iPhone trade-in campaign, our stores more than doubled the of iPhones traded in to last year, reaching all-time high Q1. We added Thailand to our footprint with a store in Bangkok and opened a stunning Champs-Elysees in exiting the quarter 506 stores in 22.

We repurchased 38 million Apple shares for billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.6 billion in dividends and. Consistent with our cadence, plan to provide an update our overall return program when report our quarter results. move ahead the March quarter, Iâd like to review our outlook, which the of looking information that Nancy referred to the beginning of call. This range reflects a negative year-over-year impact of $1.3 billion from foreign exchange, which represents about 210 basis points of last a more uncertain macroeconomic environment a in emerging markets. Services growth did decelerate from the growth in recent so can you talk about the factors played into that slower growth?. But if you compare what you added in versus what you to add over the years, that a annual new subscribers. we thinking about services as a lower growth segment than what you in 2018?. when talk about the services very important start from momentum that we have. As you know, we set an ambitious target for ourselves to double the of our from fiscal to 2020, which at the a CAGR. just told you, the installed base to grow nicely. It has reached billion active at the end of December and very little of our services revenue is driven what we sell in the last days. factor for the growth of the services business is that within this installed the percentage of users paying for least one is growing very strongly. During the few years, you know, we launched Apple Music, Apple Pay and service our developers on the App Store. Second, we making it easier for customers to transact on our stores. launching Apple Pay in more and more markets and so. Thirdly, as you mentioned, subscriptions are becoming a large portion of our business and they're growing well services average. the fact that we are saying that we surpass 0.5 putting a specific date I think you've seen over recent quarters been adding about 120 million number of now. If take Apple Pay as an example, it started off as the most convenient, most and most way to make payment a store or in app. Then took Apple to Safari, then we a peer-to-peer service and launching it in new markets quarter, so we are broadening scope. I think referring to deceleration in the rate that seen in. And as we explained 90 days ago, this amortization of free in the past was reported Products and now gets Services. reclassification is actually dilutive to our growth rate because the amortization of free services is relatively stable number, gets applied growing base. Roughly 60% our Services business is the United. in general, we tend not to reprice our for foreign exchange on very frequent basis. The second factor is well-known issue around the Store in China. App Store in China is a large business for us. But general, we are very, very pleased 19% growth we think that the business to nicely going forward. And should we think the right rate going forward?. We will continue to at the end of every. And the way, when report our March quarter results, we will talk about the step in our program which is that do traditionally the spring. Some have the perception you priced the new products, the iPhones too what you learned price elasticity?. so what we have done January and in some locations and some products is essentially absorbed part or all of the currency as compared to last and therefore get close or right on local price a. those and got a of to address that including installment which I had as well. Well Steve, did mention on the last quarter that different timing of our launches would affect year-over-year compares. While last the iPhone X shipped in Q1 the December quarter, plays the channel fill and initial sales the December quarter. looks like the midpoint of your Q2 revenue guidance implies steepest Q1 to Q2 decline in revenues in history. I'm wondering, if you comment about that's conservatism, whether you're entering the quarter a high level of channel inventory and maybe can explicitly on that, or you actually think the conditions are getting worse?. done pretty with that until the December quarter, right?. we think year will be similar and we've exited December quarter with levels inventory that are with. And we expect that key factors that Tim mentioned the call affecting iPhone performance in Q1 will also an effect on starting with U.S. environment. impact from currency is going to be about $1.3 billion, so that's bit more than points year's revenue and so obviously. On the positive side, we that we continue to grow revenue nicely from the the which is iPhone. your event Lisa Jackson, an Apple VP, stated the needed to quote products to last as as possible. Apple's clearly doing that by helping with the battery replacement program, iOS on an older of products et cetera. But guess question why doesn't that mean that replacement or upgrade cycles for iPhones should continue to extend forward part almost of objectives?. And maybe to that end, you can help us understand what iPhones' average cycle might be today, and how that have changed last three to years. I on this and before, that upgrades for the quarter less than due to the that we had mentioned. So, it goes the future, don't know, but that making a great that is high quality, is thing for customer we work for the user. ask about the trajectory of Services gross margin, up about basis points it appears. But what's driving the improvement or it be as we go the year depending quarters and mix?. I think you've seen that Services gross increased on a year-over-year basis by significant. of these services are scaling and so we tend to expand gross margins. them to be accretive to the average gross margin for services, also because of the way we account for. For example, you know that on the App Store, we book revenue a net and therefore gross tend be accretive. And so depending on how these separate businesses marketplace, we're going to seeing some level of movement going on services margins. I wouldn't draw conclusion on how this services gross margin is going to move time. It is important for us grow gross margin dollars. And times we grow services that are at level of gross margins, which below average, as this good for and as long as we dollars we're to be very. The second way is AirPlay 2, we just pointed on a number of different third-party TVs. makes the in the living room with people using our even better. And I would that that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and to likely multiple services their current bundle. Is it that the free services non cash revenue that's getting booked the Services revenue with no cost and then the costs products?. We estimate the value that can be associated to free. In case, it's providing services, providing Siri and providing free iCloud to all the customers purchase product. That value deferred gets amortized over the estimated of time that we deliver the free services. Now in connection with the new revenue standard, we are essentially that amortization from revenue to services revenue. So total revenue has not changed, we just estimated value under the Services category. did make services gross margin, got it. And then my -- my question is just, when you think about growth in have selling more to subscription it's the million going billion. base has nicely over the last several years. Then that installed base, of course we to make sure there more people that are in services that transacting on services a free basis, are interested in paying those services. to make it easier for our customers to use our services so we are accepting and more methods around the. as said the idea of adding new is important to us. During the last three we've added Apple Pay, which has been incredibly successful is a wonderful experience. Apple Music, where we now have more than 50 million subscribers continues to grow very nicely. We provide an advertising service for developers in App. The we've added services in the past, obviously, we're also very interested in adding provide value to customers the future.",51.11,0.8780393600463867

We also repurchased 71.7 million Apple shares $12 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.4 billion in dividends and. also want to work towards a more optimal capital we said it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral. Given our confidence in Apple's future the value we in stock, our has an additional $75 billion for repurchases. And because know many of our investors income, we're raising our quarterly dividend for the time in less seven years $0.77, an increase about from previous amount. over $14 billion in and the last four quarters alone, us one of the dividend payers the. Going forward, we continue to plan for annual increases in per share. move ahead the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, includes types forward-looking information that Nancy referred to the beginning of call. Also as a reminder, in June quarter last year, our Services revenue included a favorable $236 million item in connection with final resolution of. the approved today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock, payable on May 2019 to shareholders record as of 15, 2019. mentioned that last few weeks of quarter, were stabilizing in markets, I. in the space, we saw performance in the last weeks of quarter as compared to full quarter or and December, which sort -- it to be trough. our trade-in and programs that weâve implemented our retail stores have been very well there, and I'm with the results. from our point view, has affected consumer confidence on ground there in positive way. so, I a set of all of these and we certainly feel a lot better than ago. And should think about this with regard to -- I don't know your plans in the future because I'm sure you're not going talk about you're going to do but helps that path. Tim, talked about responding well to these pricing actions that you've taken in market. Do any of learnings kind of through into how you decide pricing in the emerging markets, like et cetera as you get for next product cycle?. of that incremental is going support the services that launch later in the year?. course, are supporting our products services business you can see the trajectory our OpEx over different quarters. as we add new we will need to the necessary investments support them. And clearly we make all the necessary to that the new services are and we're by the of customer we received so far anticipation for the of these services. Luca, if look back over the past five years, June quarter revenue typically about 15% from March quarter. mind by the way, we are reporting this guidance including a 300 basis point negative impact actually currency numbers would be even stronger. At the category level, we expect that we continue to have revenue growth from the categories as we've for the half of our year. also a relative improvement in our iPhone on a basis in Q3 versus the first half. March was the strongest month the quarter year-over-year basis and has the confidence to guidance that you've seen. of course, as you've from results for the March China is geo where we found challenges, but believe the should improve over time. then just how meaningful you think 5G is upgrades in your iPhone installed base?. a lot of things the different technologies and try to look at -- and select that things come together and those into products as soon as we. On the flip side of there's a number things in the commodity going in the moment NAND. that's probably split or shared both Tim Luca on a response, but I'll ask the question you can decide how to divide it up. you'd mentioned about pricing adjustments that made in some of markets and Luca also about strength of the trade-in program maybe it was also. you help us understand about what type of or elasticity you've learned pricing and the trade-in of how it impacts like COGS margins things?. And I four things that I believe are responsible the better year-over-year performance in the relative to Q1 and the final of better than the average. does -- from a customer user point trade-in looks like a subsidy, and it is a way to offset the device cost itself. And then finally -- and this is not be under weighted either I the improved trade dialogue between the countries confidence in way. the experience we've in a few of these emerging markets has been positive that respect and think the really. a lot color around trade-ins, but I was hoping maybe characterize what you're seeing across your installed base on trade-ins. In terms of the incentives we're offering in our retail stores a trade-in that has that is more the sort the blue book of the if you will lack a better description. I think the key is we're to build a build something into the mindset that for the and good for them. best of current device to else that use that in some cases is an end of life we recycling the on it to make sure it can carry in form. And my follow-up Luca you just clarify if the settlement with Qualcomm creating either a or a your gross margins the near-term?. What you see our gross guidance for the June to fully comprehends the outcome the agreement Qualcomm. you have more than 1.4 billion devices at your event you announced services that leverage that base. So, I the and I know some of these services aren't live yet but should continuation of the building out of new categories what saw the event?. Is a pipeline of new services in the works?. I wouldn't want to get announcing things the call, but obviously, we're always working on things. then mentioned the App Store search ad business a couple of in prepared remarks. Is that reaching a point it's become material and maybe moving the needle for overall revenue?. imagine is a high-margin at least maybe higher than the overall Services margin but wondering if you can case or. Our next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital Markets. Tim, at the four things that have announced. I they have different dates when they're coming out but, ones would say over the next 12 months has the most potential to your line?. And I tell you right now is that the -- we're taking sort consumer interest on the there's of on that we're excited. And the Arcade will serve some of that market. And it serves it with a different of game, we think will be great for developers great users. We think that most users are going to get multiple over-the-top. our best to convince them that the Apple TV+ should be one of them. then, we're working very hard to get everyone to give Apple News+ a look. A quick India, obviously market share there is well below China. what's the -- obviously potential could be huge the to be pretty dominated on the Android side, so maybe if you just talk about trying to aggressively ramp share there. I India is a important in the long-term.",49.79,0.9051061272621155

We expect revenue to be between million and $64. This guidance includes almost $1 billion of year-over-year negative impact from foreign exchange. Clearly, we to have continued strong growth from the categories. Our services business, we an record in June. as we to quickly that is to help us as we through year. Keep mind that the guidance includes an estimated almost $1 of foreign for the quarter. Just curious, the few things that are driving success in China, and how sustainable do think are for as you go forward. And seeing a growing engagement the broader Apple ecosystem during the quarter. And so, when you look at it, each of categories, iPhone, Mac, wearables, everything improved sequentially. would point out, I think I mentioned my comments, that we actually grew in constant currency Greater China we grew on a reported. are on a normalized removing the one-time item from year, was 15%. Clearly FX, a role around the world, 300 basis impact during the June quarter. In spite of an all-time record revenue. It's growing every geography growing across all our major product and that is very important for the services business. I would I'll give a bit more color around two offsetting factors around performance during the June. On one side, App Store, mentioned in prepared remarks that growth accelerated sequentially. We had double-digit growth on the App Store in every. As know, we tend to monetize in China on the Store through game titles and the has approved a few key during quarter. is we wanted to the size of the services business 2016 to 2020. And of course, as you mentioned, very excited about fact that we're going to launching new services soon. said, we're the rollout Apple in August, and there's two more very important services that weâre going to be adding our portfolio during the fall. I know you mentioned worth of top-line impact, I think from, last. So of course, Shannon, you've seen, guidance for margin is 50 points higher than guidance that we had given for. to go back to the discussion around strength in China in the and understand what linearity looked like. We obviously took account all of the information that we had coming out with the across quarter and how this quarter has. And then just on the App Store, appreciate not a of around exact timing and even pricing of new services, but how should we think that launched in March the. to the model in the back half of this year, or will the be more longer in nature really show up 2020?. let me just about the new that we've in March, and then the timing how we get revenue, right?. announced Apple News+, and this is the that is available for consumers right now. for all these services, there's a trial period up front, going to be different trial periods, see that what they look like. all of them add to our base will help us with rates as we get into next year. Those two things in the aggregate led the combination of and online, short form that is retail Store let growth in June trajectory. We have other products where people are both purchasing things, they're watching Apple. more to answer question about growth as we go forward, way see is, we have hardware portfolio ever, we've new on way, pipeline full of new stuff both on product and the services side. is growing, hit a new record, that's obviously good. And it hit a new record across all geographies and across categories. And during tactically emerging markets a bit of a rebound. And in fact, on a constant basis, we actually grew slightly emerging markets. some of this in his comments and that continues to be a big opportunity for us. we've got lots of what I would call core kinds of like augmented reality, big bets and bet that have a big future, in addition to the health kinds may fall the watch. How are you thinking about the longer-term footprint for manufacturing and can you any potential alternatives that you've at and considered in moving parts production potentially of China. And there is, maybe for you, there's some significant destocking of inventory first half this in iPhone. Can you about the broader channel inventory levels where you in your typical ranges, given the comment around June sales being quite strong do you anything atypical in channel inventory in the quarter?. we reduced channel inventory for iPhone slightly more than last and that is true in total and it's true for Greater as well. So, we very good our channel inventory ranges we get into the quarter. is probably to Tim one for Luca. I will ask them at so you can continue other one you want to answer, first or second. one is for Tim, regarding the installed comment you've which is quite encouraging, but yet you look at the iPhone year-over-year the past have down. Is it mostly because secondary users are the ones coming into the as people are holding more phones longer?. And then for Luca, you've been investing a lot, a lot, lot and lot of these services now coming to pass whether it Cloud, these wearables Apple Pay Arcade. Are we a point where a lot of harvesting is going to do you kind of relatively same that doing for the strategy. it's I'll start with your installed base question. It's a function of the robustness the secondary market, we think hits an. market is very and we're doing programs et cetera to that, because we think we wind up a cost that we in another way. to go into the specific numbers, but I think you can see readily, how the base is growing an where iPhone revenue is within a 90-day of. And on OpEx, obviously is very for us continue to invest the business, particularly the R&D side, because we want innovation into the market. We to improve the user and differentiate our products services in the. Of course, we'll continue to invest in marketing and advertising. We talked a lot of services that we are launching during the and Apple next month, obviously they will require the level of advertising as we launch to general. When you look in total, where we are terms of our expense revenue ratio for operating expenses, you know, well that we competitive relative to other companies. So, want to continue to competitive and at the same time we will not under-invest business. I wanted to with the announcement at around the independent App for the Watch. What level of interest have you seen from developers are about the ability to monetize independently on those App Stores?. tools around ARKit and AR in general that I through earlier, lots of there, of from the Watch App to the Catalyst be released macOS Catalina, quickly to port a to the. We think is huge and so great the user. you look at all of these and all the things I talked about earlier I be happier with reception we're getting and the that is on scenes now for developers apps the fall. If I just follow-up the China market, one of things we're is going the into 2020 there'll a of phones launching that market the players.",51.31,0.6909617185592651

Paxton, our Head of Investor Relations for the last 23 years has decided to at the end of after a wonderful year career at Apple earnings calls. Nancy has been the face of Apple with analysts and investors over a period of growth and success. the business at hand the 93rd time, and the call to questions. iPhone revenue trajectory did improve, but it's still declined 9%. We are very thrilled with what we're seeing in early on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro. I don't want to make a long-range here. And Luca on margins guidance is with but there a lot going under the covers; tariffs could expand in there impact from bundle; you have some currency in commodity price. So can you just talk the and takes that land you the December quarter margin guidance?. the other side, foreign exchange for us to biggest headwind that we've got right is going to be 70 basis points on a basis. Also keep mind that during holiday season, a higher mix of products revenue we have in other quarters, and that dilutive to company to the company margin. on one we've got better commodity pricing, the environment better than it was a year foreign exchange is a impact of 120 on a year-over-year basis. category has strong, and it's hard to believe now essentially the same size as Mac. But related to Apple's initiatives healthcare, you think health-related features a primary driver Wearables growth and conversely a rising installed base of Wearables that to the ongoing innovation within Apple health?. And think the new feature of Always-On Series 5 is a game changer for users. And in terms of other health-related things we have going, we will be to build out our records connection into the app, really democratizes the health, and they can easily go from doctor doctor. got going I had mentioned there will be more of those through time, and obviously got things we're not going to talk yet that working on. But as I've before, my view is there will be day in future that we greatest will be to people's health. Yes, a gift our users, and from a business point of view, we'd like to -- really proud of content. price for those people that are buying a device in period of time that the price is very aggressive well. one, Tim, if you think Services less than $2 billion away from the targets had laid a few years back. I am wondering if you think about the growth you've had over the last several years, average, I how much of do you was driven by the installed growing monetization of the base. I think, we opportunities, Amit, in both the growth the installed base Luca mentioned in his comments, we continue to grow across category, highs in last quarter we hit highs in all of 20. installed base is clearly a piece of getting the trade-in program and secondary market moving helpful in as well. if you look at the number of services that have been added over the years, significant and love them. And obviously - finally in getting more people that are enjoying for free to - let to pay for some of the services. And if I was just kind of go back to the variables especially as I think about Apple Watch is there central way what's the attach today to iOS devices AirPod update. think about 900 million plus iPhone what kind of penetration do you have at Wearables and how maybe as you go. The -- what we're seeing in terms of adds on the I Luca have this in is three-quarters of the Apple Watch buyers are new to Apple Watch. I anticipate that will carry to this quarter too and we are really proud to add another for people wanting noise-cancelling with the AirPod Pro to today. we had a very good September, and lead of that is and so feel really good about how we've gotten there. macro basis, I the trade is less and that clearly looks right now the comments we've reading in the. I would also say, it's not all about iPhone in China, the services area grew double. And then, I'm curious, you can talk a bit about think about operating expense growth. Our investments during the last few years have been in because obviously we to continue to innovate, improve the experience differentiate our. Obviously, if you at what launched in the last few and few we launched a lot of new and now we launching a lot new services. your guidance, the midpoint of your guidance revenues on a sequential it's up 36.5%. Historically, fiscal Q4 Q1 was up 50% more, and even last year given that iPhone is a slower growing product, you guided for to be up 45% sequentially. given enthusiasm about the iPhone 11 launch the new products the services, I the question is, why your guidance not stronger Q1 on top line?. The guidance that we providing if look at at the midpoint implies acceleration of from performance that seen during the of fiscal 2019. We feel very good as said about iPhone, the the new cycle has started, we expect improvement in our growth on. One thing to keep mind as at this guidance is that we also contemplated the comparison to launch of iPad Pro, year ago as the new Air that launched during the December quarter. for categories, you to keep in mind that our timing is different on year-over-year basis. And then if I could follow-up, just on the bundling Apple TV+, guess Tim, is really first time we've seen significant of services and hardware offering. And maybe while we're on either or Luca could give us second tutorial on how should think about the deferred revenue accounting?. we need to make assumptions around take rate of customers on the -- on Apple right. Obviously, those will possibly change over time we get more information on how the customers behave. haven't the service yet - we're going to serve - our customers. of hardware as a as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today essentially view hardware like that are on plans and so forth. first question is about pricing and the effect of some the lower price points iPhone 11 as to last. looked like margins and revenues on that, and also followed some price you made emerging markets last we've seen some improvement in China well. So if you talk tells us about pricing strategy in general and perhaps that you're willing little more flexible approach to drive some if going to have positive effect?. Yes, think that the price moves made have been smart and and do show a level but the most important far the product. got the best line-up we've ever had the customer response the product and the product for them is incredible. And so think it's product and then prices sort of falls out of and we did to more aggressive. early going, I think it the right call. a follow-on, perhaps could talk about the potential for some of the tariffs that are upcoming what you have view of what potential that could have going and how Apple looking to. general, view is very positive in terms of how going, and that positive view is in guidance as well. just wanted to start with one of the new Apple Arcade, and if you have any in terms of what you're seeing for engagement retention of customers beyond the initial period your partnerships with. The feedback to has really been incredible and we're very for the future of the service. as mentioned before, 3 out of customers buying Apple Watch currently or last quarter I should say were buying an Apple Watch for the first time. And there is still a very, very large new to Apple Watch in this regard. think the upgrade market will at larger over but don't have a current view as to -- how and so. On the AirPods anxious to the customers for the new AirPods Pro. But I would that one particularly in the early be that AirPods today and have have a for the times they need cancellation.",46.85,0.7938703894615173

We are well on our way to our goal of our fiscal year services revenue during. We've actually reached that on a run-rate basis the of the December quarter. Customer engagement our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both, transacting and paid accounts on our digital stores reached a new all-time with growing double digits all our geographic segments. And at point, we expect to hit goal of surpassing 500 million mark during the March quarter. the tremendous momentum experiencing across our services offerings, we're increasing our target for paid and aim to reach million before the end of 2020.

Importantly, half of the customers purchasing Macs and around the world during the quarter, new to that product. And the active installed base of both Mac and iPad reached a new high.

Wearables, home and accessories established a new all-time record with revenue of $10 billion, up year-over-year with very double-digit performance all geographic segments and growth across Wearables, accessories and. We all-time records for Wearables in virtually every market we track, even as we experience some shortages to very strong demand for both Apple Watch and AirPods during the. We also to see strong demand for our in the enterprise as our solutions enable businesses to do their best. 100% of Fortune companies in the healthcare sector use Apple technology in areas as patient experience, clinical communications and nursing workflows, also seeing smaller companies in this sector innovation with our. This helps clinicians have more complete and timely information whether a patient needs intervention, which can impact both, outcomes and costs. example Butterfly Network, a medical imaging company, which handheld ultrasound device that connects iPhone or iPad to enable clinicians to take an ultrasound at a cost that dramatically lower than other solutions in. We ended the quarter with $207 billion in cash marketable. a result, net cash was $99 billion at the of quarter and maintained our of reaching a cash neutral position over. We returned $25 billion to shareholders during the December. We also repurchased 40 million Apple shares $10 billion, through open market transactions, and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and. As we done for the several years, we would our plans for next phase our capital program when we results for the quarter. we move into the March quarter, like to review our which the of forward-looking information that Tejas referred at the beginning the call. The wider than usual revenue range comprehends related to the recently unfolding public health situation in China. first one for me on fairly to see, itâs already a billion for you guys. you look at the Apple, the Wearables a category within Wearables, and revenue, Wearables 44%. Both Apple Watch and AirPods did very in terms of collecting new customers. Apple Watch particular, 75% of the customers are new to the Apple Watch. itâs still very much a selling to customers at this point. quarter guide I implies gross margin of flat to actually 10, 15 basis point. It's rare for you guys to actually margins up March I think because you have fairly high sales deleverage happening. So, what are the offsets that's enabling what looks like a better seasonal guide for gross margins?. wanted to know internally, how you're getting success, it truly on critical acclaim, is of consumers that service, contribution and service revenue, et cetera, et. then, second question is I think you indicated last month we offering consumers the to use Apple to iPhone on installment basis. retail stores did fantastic on iPhone, very strong double-digit growth in iPhone from a year-over-year point of view. In terms of China, results from last then I will get into coronavirus in a second. For the results from last quarter, we had growth for iPhone in China. We also had double-digit growth in in Mainland China and we had extremely strong double-digit on. so, there were a number of different factors in terms of responding to. are tracking quite a large percentage of new customers on products like Mac. of the customers a Mac in China are and nearly two-thirds of the customers iPad are new. are also very closely with our team and our in the affected areas, and we limited travel business critical situations as of last. As Luca mentioned, we have a than usual revenue range for the second to the greater uncertainty. supply sources that are outside the Wuhan the impact is less clear at. factories after Chinese New has been moved from the end of this month February 10th, depending the supplier location, and we've account for delayed start up through our larger range of outcomes Luca mentioned. With respect to customer demand and sales, we've currently closed one of our retail and number of partners have also closed their store. Luca, maybe if you could touch on from a gross margin perspective, commodity environment and availability. As I said earlier around the margin guidance for the quarter, we seeing a benign environment. As always, and as you know, we look the way these prices move and times we feel appropriate we certain commodities in advance. Luca, can you address the modest in services growth this quarter, versus in September?. the December quarter, we look it our fiscal â19 growth which was. So, we very good the results for the quarter. As Tim I mentioned during our prepared remarks, it very broad-based growth because we double digits services across the five geographies. We all-time records for many, many categories, music, cloud, search ads, payment services, December records for the App Store and the. first, we set a to double our fiscal â16 during 2020. And when look at on a rate basis, weâve already achieved that goal of December quarter. And given we are at 480 at end of December, expect to pass the March quarter. So, now, we setting a new target for ourselves paid subscriptions. feel that the services business is growing well. And so, these services not have a impact in December results, we expect over time they start the growth the business. Tim, as a follow-up, at some point the future, Apple will launch a 5G. So, we seeing some signs of new spectrum being deployed deployments and even additional 4G capacity, and itâs already having a impact for handset upgrades capacity?. I think that had great partners, not only in the U.S. but around the world that are really helpful this. And the comment that you made about capacity the with AirPods Pro and Apple Watch 3, what we think the timeline of when constraints be alleviated?. Tim, Apple has a very valuable installed base of users. Can you see a future where Apple can become larger in the market, build TV+, given you could the unique position ability to drive targeted ads to users without privacy?. think for TV+ we feel strongly that what customer wants is an add-free product, that's not aversion to ads, itâs we believe a customer. can you just clarify if the services revenue this quarter had any of deferrals TV+ at all?. how can you us the impact of the amortization of the content costs with TV+ we think the couple of years?. When you about what goes into the Apple TV+ at this point, there are components. There is subscribers, these are customers that for the service and recognize revenue over the subscription period. These are the customers that buy an hardware device and redeem the offer for three-year TV+ services. We deferred revenue for based items, the one is of the that is being provided, the year of Apple. And third one is our estimate of the number of that will redeem offer. So, these inputs provide us with the amount of that we deferred for each device sale that then gets over the one-year period the plus service has provided. So, when you the of paid subscribers and bundled subscribers, you the TV+ revenue. Of because weâve launched the service very recently, amount of revenue that recognized during the was immaterial to our results. There is a general view that when 5G phones come out be more expensive to higher costs, but the same time, it looks like you guys have that is market for low cost to phones like. OpEx as percentage of sales for March looks like e about 15% higher than in your quarters. I think felt good about our OpEx results, they were at low end of guidance range. And in of the new services, not only TV+ but all the services that launched during this where weâre making investments in and marketing, and that level of investment is in our results. And also, as you correctly stated, we the acquisition the baseband business in December quarter. And we had we reflected run rate of expenses related to business, partially during quarter, the completion the transaction. There is a third of expenses that affected the quarter, and itâs a our was very strong, and we have certain. So, slightly take on an question on and that is, what impact you think Wearables is into the Apple ecosystem?. I'm sure a lot of existing iPhone, iPads or users are going to but do you think Wearables into the ecosystem to buy other devices a. With each product that a buys, think, they get tighter into ecosystem because they -- that's reason that they're into is they like experience, the customer experience. think, in case itâs more likely that the iPhone comes but there's no doubt in my mind that some people that came into for the. And I'm wondering you could share how you think starts to our lives most significantly. is the excited about it is, you rarely have a new where are both see it as to them. you can see -- you go on to thousands of apps are AR enabled this and even more coming. But, if you could talk about what's happening the mix within is that improving as well and helping margins?. And I think the helped us both in Q1 and helping us with the guidance Q2. The for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max is being exceptional. The other that I would like to point out is as we move from Q1 of revenue coming from services the holiday quarter. that fact that services are accretive to gross for Company, we end up getting a better mix from as well. has been growing a faster rate revenue for I guess largely over the last three years so. Is there a point in time where level and you get some on that or is it just the of a faster revenue growth future?. our OpEx grows than our revenue but also had in the recent past the opposite has happened. look this past year, we launched many new initiatives, for on the services want to with the appropriate level of and only marketing advertising also in R&D. As mentioned we closed the acquisition of Intel baseband we think itâs a important strategic technology the Company forward. Our net for example was 11% during the December. I just wanted to kind of ask on the iPhone growth, definitely good see return. Based on the velocity and momentum youâre seeing for exiting the quarter, comfortable are feeling about sustaining growth in iPhone year?. so, weâve given you the that we expect for the current and really don't a range beyond that. At the same time, would say, within a more difficult macro environment, did incredibly well the quarter, six of the top seven selling smart models in Japan December quarter iPhones. The customers very very and we have very strong there, we feel we have very good momentum.",52.23,0.6937049627304077
19,apple,q2,20," Welcome to the Apple Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Conference Call. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would call over to Mr. Gala, Senior Manager, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Today Apple reports $58.3 billion in revenue, an all-time record for Services, and a quarterly record for Wearables, Home and Accessories. It was a quarterly revenue record for Apple Retail powered by phenomenal growth in. Amid most challenging global environment in which weâve ever operated business, weâre proud to say that Apple grew during quarter. And I that how have responded, what have been inspired do, tells an story about great durability as a business, enduring importance of products in our lives. And when the strike, our teams not only succeeded growing the business introducing new products, our customersâ but they also rose to the occasion terms meeting our broader obligations to the in which we and. In a where achieved strong growth, which will dig into in a minute, and which durability our strategy, these teams were also COVID-19 front and. As Apple News, reached 125 million monthly active users, we elevated information from reliable sources through a special COVID-19 vertical. We let customers skip payments without incurring interest on Apple Card for March and April in light of financial hardship for many. We worked with everyone from Oprah to Lady to inform, entertain and give through Apple TV and services like FaceTime and Messages set all-time records for daily volume during this quarter as users relied new. And this month, to accelerate contact tracing, we are a joint with Google to enable the use of Bluetooth technology to help and health agencies reduce the spread of the user privacy and security central. major corporate donations to response efforts around the world to support global as a new fund food insecurity as a result of the. This extends of course to our retail employees, they Appleâs face to customers and instrumental part of and weâre them normally despite store closures. While we felt temporary supply constraints in February, operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners safely returning to work and production back at typical levels toward end March. At this time of social distance, of shuttered and gathering places, of delayed and new ways of socializing, we have seen significant evidence that our products have taken a. Since early March, weâve seen unprecedented demand for a pro app from students, enthusiasts and creative professionals. With new FDA guidance on non-invasive remote patient monitoring, for example, the ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly used facilitate remote ECG measurements and for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and healthcare provider contact and exposure. The performance our product business had three very different phases the March quarter. Based Appleâs performance during the first five weeks of the quarter, we were were headed a second quarter at the high end of expectations. In the next weeks of the as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, well demand for our products China. At point, demand for our products outside of China was still strong in line with our expectations. Given the of visibility and uncertainly in the term, we not be issuing guidance for the quarter. We have to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that to a broad cross-section of customers, iPhone SE, which achieved unmatched technological capacity at an. For a company whose business is innovation, are real upsides in periodically having figure out how to do just about everything in a brand new. expect to meet our longstanding of doubling our fiscal Services revenue in. entered this period unmatched financial strain, a robust cash position and our best pipeline. Major investments, including our five-year commitment to contribute billion to the here in the United States are full speed ahead. will to do we can do to help the global response and to keep our customers learning, sharing, and connecting can remain it can during this challenging time. It has been very quarter than we expecting when we talked to you at the end of January. we not be more proud of our Apple around the world, our role supporting local and our partners throughout value and resilient our business financial performance has during these times. So, the revenue for the quarter the extreme from the impact of COVID-19 and a headwind of 100 points from exchange. After a strong January, our was impacted particularly during the last three weeks and point-of-sale closures increase to COVID-19 spreading around the and affected our product. on a our performance was stronger than our results as we iPhone channel inventory more we did a year. Importantly, our installed base of active devices an all-time high in all our geographic segments and all major categories. revenue followed a different with very strong year-over-year growth of 17%. We a new all-time revenue record of billion with all-time records in many of our Services categories and in most countries we. Company gross margin was flat sequentially with cost savings and mix shift towards Services offset by the loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 30.3%, decreasing 380 basis points sequentially due to loss of and unfavorable mix. Services gross margin was 65.4%, up 100 basis points sequentially, by favorable mix. cash flow was very strong at $13.3 an improvement of $2.2 a year ago. iPhone of $29 billion, declined 7% year-over-year as iPhone supply and demand were affected by the impact of COVID-19 at some point during the quarter. On the supply side, we suffered from some temporary supply shortages February, been extremely pleased the resilience and adaptability global supply chain, as well as its ability to get back to safely when allow. operations and manufacturing partners put forth an extraordinary effort to production and we exited the quarter position for most of our product. While we see a slight elongation in our replacement towards the end the quarter, attribute the widespread closures, our active base of iPhones has an high. We set an all-time revenue of $13.3 billion with strong performance across the with all-time revenue records in the Store, Apple Music, Video, cloud services, App Store ad. And we also set a March quarter record AppleCare. Tim mentioned, weâre well on way to accomplishing goal of doubling fiscal â16 Services revenue during 2020. App Store revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased over 30% year-over-year, reaching a new all-time. Apple Music and cloud services, both set all-time revenue record and AppleCare set a March quarter record. subscriptions for three of these services were up strong double-digits. Customer engagement our ecosystem continues to grow strongly, and the number both transacting and paid accounts our stores reached a new all-time high the March quarter. this momentum, weâre we will reach our increased target of 600 paid subscriptions the end of 2020. Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new March quarter record with revenue $6.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year with strong double digit performance across all five geographic. Our Wearables is the size of a Fortune company, and weâre very excited by this product category. For Apple Watch continues to its reach over 75% of the customers Apple Watch world the quarter were new to the product. Towards the end of the quarter, we launched a brand new iPad Pro that includes in class LiDAR scanner with some really exciting reality applications; and MacBook Air with improved at a price. Weâre very pleased with the strong interest for both. Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world the quarter new to product the active base for both Mac and iPad a new all-time high. And the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 95% for iPad and 96% Mac. In the enterprise market everywhere have been making the transition to remotely. Weâve created content to assist our customers in this transition including an on-demand video learning series on topics remote deployments iPad and Mac and. Weâve also realigned our retail business and enterprise teams to provide timely and relevant support to customers as they new work. Some of our largest customers offering Mac to employees such as and SAP have been able to pivot quickly to allow easily and secure their home, benefiting from Apple Business Manager zero-touch deployment. And weâve seen examples of new projects of remote deployments implemented few. In essential such as grocery and services, weâve seen organizations adopt our technology to serve their customers safely. In where safety and securities are a top priority, one way to protect company and client is by providing corporate iOS devices who use mobile daily as part their jobs. We ended the quarter with $193 billion in cash plus marketable securities, total debt $110. And a result, cash was $83 at the end of the. We returned $22 billion to shareholders during the March quarter, including $18.5 billion through open market repurchases of 64.7 million Apple and $3.4 billion in dividends and. we move into the June quarter, like to provide some on which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred at the beginning the call. As Tim given the lack of visibility and in the term, we will not for the coming quarter. However, based on what we have seen in and how we might play I would to provide some additional insight on and tailwinds weâre facing. as a we expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by more $1.5 on a year-over-year basis. We are in a typical supply position, including usual ramp associated with new products. These newly products, iPad Pro, MacBook Air, and iPhone SE have all received outstanding customer response, even during these extreme. On iPhone Wearables, we expect a year-over-year revenue to in the June quarter relative to March quarter; on iPad Mac, we expect the year-over-year revenue in the June quarter. First, customers actively engaging with our ecosystem and digital services, and we the very strong recent the Store, Video, Music, and cloud will continue throughout the June quarter. Second, the overall reduced level of economic due to lockdowns around the world, services like AppleCare and are being impacted. AppleCare is comprised of our product repair business and the with our customers, of have been obviously by store closures and level of traffic. Advertising, which is comprised of third-party agreements, our App Store search ads, and Apple News ads has been impacted by overall economic and uncertainty on when reopen. For gross sequential headwinds include foreign exchange, mix within products, and seasonal loss of leverage on our product business. Regarding product keep in the we provided at the revenue level. Sequential tailwinds include cost and the mix shift towards services. We are in the midst developing our most exciting pipeline products and services ever contributing over $350 to the economy and expanding our footprint in around the country a five-year. also continue to believe that there is great value our stock, we are our target of a net cash neutral position over. As a testament to confidence we have in our and into future, our Board has authorized $50 for repurchases addition to over billion authorization under current share. most importantly, we are Apple for the long as weâve always. During times historically, we have to invest in the this remains our philosophy. continue to stay focused what we do investing in our product and service managing the business wisely, and care of our teams believe we will come out from this. Tim, you talked about some improvement in the second half April. So, was wondering if you could just talk maybe bit more the segment, geographic what youâre seeing and the various regions that selling and youâre hearing from. And from a demand point we then an improvement in March over February. And if you look at, kind of where we are further improvement April as to March. If look at the rest the world, we were doing in the first weeks of quarter. spent sort of reacting getting the supply chain back up in full force and through the sharp decline China I already talked about. The real for the rest of the in March when the orders went and the work-from-home began. For those two, three weeks the of the we saw a sharp decline in demand. now out into and look at that, early April like the end of March, in the second half April, weâve seen an uptick across really board. In particular for as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and are going to a this quarter, and customers are either education or working remotely. So, we know that the core the the core the is innovation and development. are new investments in new services that we launched. And so, will try to need continue to invest during difficult circumstances and the we like wisely. Tim, think I speak for everyone the call weâre very appreciative of Appleâs pandemic. Tim, in past downturns, we have really seen pull back from investing. And so, you can tell, with everything else on, we able to launch and iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard, the MacBook Air. And the business continues and the new products our lifeblood. can from what did this despite the environment, we have head are working because we that customers want the products weâve got. As a follow-up, know youâre a lot with both the Apple Card and financing for iPhones to get your products hands of. Well, as you know, we launched the payment earlier Apple for iPhone. on doing that for other products as. Where do you see structural changes on the back of this health crisis that might opportunities for new revenue at Apple?. I think, there are things just a great reminder of how our products are for remote work. I thatâs probably also true about working remotely in some areas in some. doing that because viewed that that area was huge opportunity for the and for to help a lot of. then, as a the $50 billion share is impressive in absolute terms, but it is a bit lower the last. And when you look at our at the end every quarter, you see much we actually in terms share repurchases. $50 is in addition to over $40 that is still remaining from the past authorization that our Board,. always for ways to our product roadmaps fill gaps in portfolio, both on the hardware side, the software side, the services. I was if could about how did channel inventory look in the March quarter, because it sounds like it may below the historical. And the discussion you had for June quarter performance of are you embedding from a channel building back levels that expectation. you could maybe talk a bit about, how do you think about manufacturing strategy and perhaps need for some diversity, especially given everything in the has gone through over the last 12 you that?. And do you feel comfortable the supply chain and the manufacturing base is well to launch traditional fall products used to from Apple?. I think, youâd have conclude, at I conclude that if look at shock to the supply chain took place for to back so quickly really demonstrates that itâs durable. I can kind of see behind it strong despite product weakness overall. you kind of look at the of the year, do you think at some does the impacts worldwide impact the line?. But Iâve said, we look into the June we see distinct trends our services business. And so, expect our digital to continue at the same of performance that we have during March quarter. And that includes the Store, of our video business, our business, services. So, expect all these businesses to to grow strongly. Given the economic environment, the level right there are two businesses that we believe are going to impacted during the quarter. AppleCare essentially of our repair business the warranty agreements that we signed with our when they purchase devices. Both these have affected obviously by the store closures. And not only retail stores, but also our partners points and obviously, the reduced level customer because of social distancing measures. And we expect to be affected during the during the quarter. So, these two things that during the June quarter create headwind for the Services business. far, April, have you seen increased downtick across your product line?. So for example, somebody might have shift maybe toward lower of the storage of certain products. I have seen strong customer response to iPhone SE, which is our most. -- we launched the Pro the midst of all this and the there also been incredibly. If I just with question on kind of what seeing China. saw in China for quarter -- and Iâll speak about mainland thatâs the source of question. We saw strong results in iPad and in Wearables, and in. And if you look up underneath the full quarter, we a strong January, a significantly reduced demand in February orders and went into in China and stores closed. of what weâve seen so far. despite stores being for the three-week period around the. partly because the had such a phenomenal and that included in China, it was other regions as well. If I can just follow up on previous comment about strong demand youâre for SE. given the price point, wondering if you expecting any change in terms the geographic mix of where the demand comes relative to typically what you see other iPhones from the up on, just giving the price point?. Chris, weâve always been about delivering best product at a good price. And I you had expected to commodity price declines the quarter. you talk about you expect, as you go through the year, perhaps this environment, and again, whether that into challenge a headwind gross margins you go into the half?. For the June we would expect NAND and DRAM pricing to remain at this historically low level, while displays and most other commodity we expect decline.",54.05,0.7019901871681213
