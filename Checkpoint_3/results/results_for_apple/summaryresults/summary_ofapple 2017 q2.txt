We will to review capital allocation taking into the needs of our business, investment opportunities, and our. move ahead the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, includes types forward-looking information that Nancy referred to the beginning of call. How were able to gross margins sequentially and guide rather for the June quarter in light of what's going on in market. me with performance for the quarter, which were very with. And this in spite of fact, as know, that we leverage as go from December quarter to the March quarter. And the fact that Services mix increases as we go through the is course also given the profile of gross margin Services. As we into the June as you we tend to have some level margin compression we from the March to the quarter. We also have a different mix products as we into the quarter, and the cost pressures on. don't guide past the quarter, we expect it be there for time being. a follow-up for Tim, as you noted in remarks, the 7 Plus demand, it's selling well. And this a product that was supply-constrained in quarter. one of the things that we not get the mix between the 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. And so took us a little while to adjust all the way back the chain and to iPhone 7 Plus into which early past quarter. you a bit about what's going on China and give us some more color, especially as you're going the year?. then obviously you won't talk about the next product launch, but just are there any in demand with China down 14%?. if look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 we sold the number of Plus models the half ever before, compared 6s compared to 6 Plus. The Mac revenue was up 20% in China, and had extremely strong Services growth the quarter in China. As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online did overall and China. They grew 21%, which is acceleration from what seen in the previous. â€“ which for is incredibly important in the retail stores because do a lot more than sell â€“ up 27% year on year. Also, where the 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform on some of the previous generation iPhones. What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but make progress. You increased your program, you still have I think $160 cash obviously continue generate cash. Shannon, you know we our capital program. Essentially the last five years, way we've run the company essentially return free cash flow our investors. that announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country, there's a lot that needs to happen there, we'll see. wanted to start off going back to 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if could comment unique number of users. made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average per user was up, or maybe Luca. There is some level overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very large, obviously less million. And if remember, quoted the same number a quarter and talked 150 million. So when think about sequential increase 15 million subscriptions the to the quarter, it really you a sense for momentum that we content. look at the that are happening on our content particularly on the App which is the largest, we fairly consistently things. increase in number of paying accounts we value this last 90 days is largest we've had. So this very large of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing ecosystem, which is obviously improving the time in quality quantity, then start on stores, and number is growing very,. we're also seeing as we look people start paying on our stores, we see pretty common trend over time. keep track across cohorts of customers, that people into the ecosystem and start on the ecosystem, we a spending profile very similar around world. so obviously, combination of spending more over time and adding people that are actually spending the stores contributes to this 40% growth mentioned for the App Store basis. thanks, Luca, and a follow-up for Tim. The keeps growing, and course the profit contribution from that is growing. we've at the same think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain key technologies, that you want penetrate the with. I wonder if could comment a little on your strategy there in terms of the of that profit contribution that Services how you intend to apply to rest of. the that pricing is come with price that we think is good value for the delivering, and we do that on side as well on the side. some consider disappointing, what seems to be a very good and ironically the competition seems be part of the market right now. Do you see A), expanding over time into a broader product line; and B), increasingly being independent of the iPhone term?. The watch units more than doubled in our top ten which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. some people are doing when you the revenues with the revenues for and as you this was the quarter shipments for AirPods. then the that a group of our customers well, and look on trailing 12 months this not forecast â€“ that was well the Fortune 500. specifically, I wonder what you believe is risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response, such as withholding modem chip potentially getting on in select around the world. why would Apple potentially take on those just in advance of what will arguably your significant and largest product launch in history?. The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying of the total iPhone value. I was wondering if I could just follow a bit on iPhone. If try for the drawdown in inventory and extra week last quarter, think sequentially iPhones declined 27% if I. rate improved marginally, when you adjust for the extra week. In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory 1.2 million units. I think that when you you're going to that the performance similar the quarters. And so four the operating segments, as Luca mentioned in his we had very good growth. was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which growing incredibly around world. Last year, had a million-unit channel inventory reduction for the. So expecting for this year just we have an apples-to-apples comparison as we think about your guidance. As know, Simona, we do not provide and around inventory but our goal is always to have the right amount weeks inventory in channel. if you look at last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory the June quarter, I think a fair to have. you've been excited about the India market for some time and have made strides in establishing a manufacturing, and R&D presence there. curious you look at that market and the rollout of us assume Apple can something on of 10 million to million iPhones year then grow. We have ton of energy going into country on a number of and is the third world today behind China and the. so we believe, particularly now 4G infrastructure is going in the country and continuing to be expanded, that is a huge opportunity Apple there. in your prepared comments you mentioned was growing digit, which is. But I believe if you look geographic India is underpenetrated from an Apple reception but yet they LTE, you have the iPhone a lower iPhone. you think that say this next 12 18 months is a or is it more you to work with there?. it's a opportunity too, and so we're all the things that we to bear in other markets that we've well and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem. just over there opening last quarter, and so there are a on there. are really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. investment really began rolling in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know. call will be available for two weeks as a podcast iTunes a webcast apple.com/investor, and via and the numbers for telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820.
