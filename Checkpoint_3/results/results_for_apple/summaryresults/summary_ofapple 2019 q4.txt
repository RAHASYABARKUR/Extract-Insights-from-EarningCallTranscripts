Paxton, our Head of Investor Relations for the last 23 years has decided to at the end of after a wonderful year career at Apple earnings calls. Nancy has been the face of Apple with analysts and investors over a period of growth and success. the business at hand the 93rd time, and the call to questions. iPhone revenue trajectory did improve, but it's still declined 9%. We are very thrilled with what we're seeing in early on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro. I don't want to make a long-range here. And Luca on margins guidance is with but there a lot going under the covers; tariffs could expand in there impact from bundle; you have some currency in commodity price. So can you just talk the and takes that land you the December quarter margin guidance?. the other side, foreign exchange for us to biggest headwind that we've got right is going to be 70 basis points on a basis. Also keep mind that during holiday season, a higher mix of products revenue we have in other quarters, and that dilutive to company to the company margin. on one we've got better commodity pricing, the environment better than it was a year foreign exchange is a impact of 120 on a year-over-year basis. category has strong, and it's hard to believe now essentially the same size as Mac. But related to Apple's initiatives healthcare, you think health-related features a primary driver Wearables growth and conversely a rising installed base of Wearables that to the ongoing innovation within Apple health?. And think the new feature of Always-On Series 5 is a game changer for users. And in terms of other health-related things we have going, we will be to build out our records connection into the app, really democratizes the health, and they can easily go from doctor doctor. got going I had mentioned there will be more of those through time, and obviously got things we're not going to talk yet that working on. But as I've before, my view is there will be day in future that we greatest will be to people's health. Yes, a gift our users, and from a business point of view, we'd like to -- really proud of content. price for those people that are buying a device in period of time that the price is very aggressive well. one, Tim, if you think Services less than $2 billion away from the targets had laid a few years back. I am wondering if you think about the growth you've had over the last several years, average, I how much of do you was driven by the installed growing monetization of the base. I think, we opportunities, Amit, in both the growth the installed base Luca mentioned in his comments, we continue to grow across category, highs in last quarter we hit highs in all of 20. installed base is clearly a piece of getting the trade-in program and secondary market moving helpful in as well. if you look at the number of services that have been added over the years, significant and love them. And obviously - finally in getting more people that are enjoying for free to - let to pay for some of the services. And if I was just kind of go back to the variables especially as I think about Apple Watch is there central way what's the attach today to iOS devices AirPod update. think about 900 million plus iPhone what kind of penetration do you have at Wearables and how maybe as you go. The -- what we're seeing in terms of adds on the I Luca have this in is three-quarters of the Apple Watch buyers are new to Apple Watch. I anticipate that will carry to this quarter too and we are really proud to add another for people wanting noise-cancelling with the AirPod Pro to today. we had a very good September, and lead of that is and so feel really good about how we've gotten there. macro basis, I the trade is less and that clearly looks right now the comments we've reading in the. I would also say, it's not all about iPhone in China, the services area grew double. And then, I'm curious, you can talk a bit about think about operating expense growth. Our investments during the last few years have been in because obviously we to continue to innovate, improve the experience differentiate our. Obviously, if you at what launched in the last few and few we launched a lot of new and now we launching a lot new services. your guidance, the midpoint of your guidance revenues on a sequential it's up 36.5%. Historically, fiscal Q4 Q1 was up 50% more, and even last year given that iPhone is a slower growing product, you guided for to be up 45% sequentially. given enthusiasm about the iPhone 11 launch the new products the services, I the question is, why your guidance not stronger Q1 on top line?. The guidance that we providing if look at at the midpoint implies acceleration of from performance that seen during the of fiscal 2019. We feel very good as said about iPhone, the the new cycle has started, we expect improvement in our growth on. One thing to keep mind as at this guidance is that we also contemplated the comparison to launch of iPad Pro, year ago as the new Air that launched during the December quarter. for categories, you to keep in mind that our timing is different on year-over-year basis. And then if I could follow-up, just on the bundling Apple TV+, guess Tim, is really first time we've seen significant of services and hardware offering. And maybe while we're on either or Luca could give us second tutorial on how should think about the deferred revenue accounting?. we need to make assumptions around take rate of customers on the -- on Apple right. Obviously, those will possibly change over time we get more information on how the customers behave. haven't the service yet - we're going to serve - our customers. of hardware as a as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today essentially view hardware like that are on plans and so forth. first question is about pricing and the effect of some the lower price points iPhone 11 as to last. looked like margins and revenues on that, and also followed some price you made emerging markets last we've seen some improvement in China well. So if you talk tells us about pricing strategy in general and perhaps that you're willing little more flexible approach to drive some if going to have positive effect?. Yes, think that the price moves made have been smart and and do show a level but the most important far the product. got the best line-up we've ever had the customer response the product and the product for them is incredible. And so think it's product and then prices sort of falls out of and we did to more aggressive. early going, I think it the right call. a follow-on, perhaps could talk about the potential for some of the tariffs that are upcoming what you have view of what potential that could have going and how Apple looking to. general, view is very positive in terms of how going, and that positive view is in guidance as well. just wanted to start with one of the new Apple Arcade, and if you have any in terms of what you're seeing for engagement retention of customers beyond the initial period your partnerships with. The feedback to has really been incredible and we're very for the future of the service. as mentioned before, 3 out of customers buying Apple Watch currently or last quarter I should say were buying an Apple Watch for the first time. And there is still a very, very large new to Apple Watch in this regard. think the upgrade market will at larger over but don't have a current view as to -- how and so. On the AirPods anxious to the customers for the new AirPods Pro. But I would that one particularly in the early be that AirPods today and have have a for the times they need cancellation.
