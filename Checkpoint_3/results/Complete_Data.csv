amazon,q2,2015,"The increase in capital expenditures and capital leases reflects additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
You clearly had a lot of things working well in the quarter, but maybe just focusing in on AWS, which seems to be quickly emerging as kid of your largest contributor to operating income.
Can you maybe provide a little more color on what drove the acceleration and just the overall growth in the business?
If you could talk a little bit about the addition of new customers versus average spend per customer and I think in the past you've talked about what unit growth was for AWS?
I wanted to know Ã¢ÂÂ you've talked a little bit about that market in the past Ã¢ÂÂ whether there was any update there in terms of how you think about approaching the market and the level of investments that might be needed to compete in the market?
So we're very happy, very encouraged early on with what we've seen in the ramping of the business, the level of invention going on for both customers and sellers.
We are also seeing a great efficiency in the business on a cost basis.
We are continuing to drive operational improvement in every business that we are in, but we are also investing in large opportunities that are in front of us, particularly in Marketplace Prime and AWS.
He said we're going to look for things that are important to customers, customers love them, businesses that can grow to be a large size that can generate a high return on invested capital and are durable and can last for decades.
A lot of it is the top-line growth, but it's also a lot of the efficiency we're seeing, particularly on the fulfillment and marketing lines, which for the whole company were flat year-over-year on a percent of revenue basis.
Just two things I wanted to ask, First on Prime Day. Brian, if you could give a little more color there on the early takeaways that you have and then also perhaps more importantly how you think that sets Amazon up for the back-to-school season and then also the holidays later in the year?
We continue to look for smart, innovative people who want to build on behalf of customers and Ã¢ÂÂ but this particular quarter is colored a bit by the operations growth.
We are looking for return on invested capital, free cash flow, and happy customers in the space.
I will also say that Amazon is one of the primary large customers of AWS so we see it in the consumer side of the business as well, although that's not included in AWS revenue.
We are really following the model of giving our customers as many choices as possible and letting them choose whether they want to buy first-party or third-party and I think we're working really hard to make sellers succeed on the platform.
Brian touched on the success that our FDA sellers had with Prime Day, but we see FBA as a tailwind for third-party business in general.
On the price reduction question, we've got a long track record of driving costs out of the business and you can certainly see where we've even done that over the last several quarters if you look at the margins in AWS.
As I said earlier we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business on the Amazon site as well.
We look to increase the leverage of our fixed assets, particularly our fulfillment centers and the throughput of the fulfillment centers, and just generally getting inventory closer to customers as we add and expand warehouses in the sort centers that we added primarily last year.
So like I said, a little early for the update at this point but something we're looking at and something the team's working really hard on.
In the Retail business obviously a lot of variables driving growth there, we're seeing higher Prime membership levels for one, but I wonder how much of that growth you can also break down by some other factors; for example, we're seeing a notable increase in selection across longer tail categories?
So, Brian, I know you guys don't like to provide guidance beyond the next quarter but philosophically if we go back a few quarters you've characterized 2015 as a year where you believe that some of the heavier investments made in prior years should start to benefit and pay off.
And we're see Ã¢ÂÂ we're clearly seeing that in AWS and in North America retail and it looks like you're still investing heavily on International retail.
And then a few other things you may have seen in our press release today, the launch of Mexico which we are excited about and Amazon business.
We are definitely working for operational efficiencies in the business that we're in.
Brian, just to follow-up on the India question earlier.
And I think as Brian mentioned, India is a country that we're doubling down on based on the success we've seen there so far.
We drive a lot of repeat business with things like Prime Pantry and Subscribe and Save and others.
Second, there have been a couple questions about shipping but most notable is that we had a couple price increases from the majors hit at the beginning of the year and it seems like you're costs are coming down.
On the FCs and whether we would expand or build new, I think we are looking to always get the most out of the fulfillment centers that we have and as we need new facilities we place them closer and closer to customers so that can have its benefits as well, but not much more to add on that one.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, July 23, 2015 only and will include forward-looking statements.
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.
As you listen to today's conference call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
Worldwide revenue grew 20% to $23.18 billion, or 27% excluding the $1.39 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign-exchange.
Consistent with prior periods we do not allocate two segments, our stock-based compensation, or the other operating expense line item.
Media revenue grew 6% to $2.62 billion or 7% excluding foreign-exchange.
North America segment operating income increased 113% to $703 million a 5.1% operating margin.
Excluding the $9 million favorable impact from foreign-exchange, North America segment operating income increased 111%.
Media revenue decreased 12% to $2.09 billion or increased 3% excluding foreign-exchange.
EGM revenue grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign-exchange.
EGM revenue grew 10% to $5.43 billion or 31% excluding foreign-exchange.
International segment operating loss includes $89 million of unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange.
Amazon Web Services segment operating income increased 407% to $391 million, a 21.4% operating margin.
Excluding the $71 million favorable impact from foreign-exchange, AWS segment operating income increased 314%.
Consolidated segment operating income increased 166% to $1.07 billion or 4.6% of revenue, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year.
Excluding the $9 million unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange, CSOI increased 168%.
Inventory increased 12% to $7.47 billion and inventory turns were 8.9 turns down from 9.1 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't include additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and if foreign-exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
This guidance anticipates approximately 620 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign-exchange rates, GAAP operating income or loss to be between $480 million loss and $70 million of income compared to a $544 million loss in the third quarter of 2014.

amazon,q3,2015,"As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.
These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
As a reminder, in the first quarter, we changed our reportable segments to report North America, International and Amazon Web Services.
The first question, Brian, International retail growth continues to improve, and I was wondering if you can just talk through some of the dynamics there, understanding that consumption tax in Japan comped, you have some newer markets where you have physical infrastructure now in Europe, and then also the dynamics in India and China as contributors.
I'll remind you that Prime Day was a global event, so we saw that is International as well, and it was a great event for Ã¢ÂÂ a great day for customers, Amazon and sellers alike.
So like AWS, the model remains early days and we enjoy leading this business and customers responded well and we believe we are adding new services and features at a rate faster than many others.
And if you could give us a sense of what CapEx for this segment of the business looked like in the quarter, and the rate of growth there would be helpful.
This is a young and rapidly growing business, and as you've seen looking backwards, certainly growth rates and margins and capital expenditure timing can be bumpy.
We're excited about the potential there, and really the team's focused on just keeping their heads down and continuing to accelerate the pace of innovation to try to continue to grow the functionality gap we think we offer.
And so, on the AWS side, we've got investment going on around the world, certainly additional servers to support the strong growth we have.
And some of the expense for things like data centers or new regions can be a little lumpy, and we've mentioned a couple of new regions we're working on throughout the world.
On EGM growth, I won't call out any particular categories, but it is a direct reflection of our efforts to grow selection, both our retail selection and also our third party, particularly FBA which is also Prime eligible and then just the responsiveness of our customers, especially our Prime customers to the EGM product line.
So we are very encouraged, as I said last quarter in India, and continue to invest there very heavily.
So we're continuing to work on some of the items we've been talking about for a couple of quarters now.
I think Amazon Global Store continues to expand the selection there.
We added about another 400,000 items to that store this quarter and continue to focus on using our global network of vendors to be able to get those products to customers.
Can you call out in terms of the 3P business what you're seeing in terms of third party sellers maybe needing to make more and more of their goods Prime eligible?
So, we have seen growth in FBA, it increases our Prime fast track eligible selection which we like and customers like.
We've been working on our network for about 20 years to be able to enable some of the really fast delivery with things like Prime Now. But at this point, we're in a relatively small list of cities, but it's expanding pretty fast.
So I just wanted to ask, is that a legitimate question do you think or are you now at a point of scale and market share and maturity that you can sustainably manage the heavy investment while still delivering material profit?
We've already talked about India but domestically we are, globally, we are investing very heavily in our Prime platform, both in North America and International and that includes video content and original content, Prime Music.
So there is a lot of investment going on and there will be continued, especially related to Prime.
The good thing about 30% revenue growth is it gives you a lot more cost to work on as well.
And then the second one, just curious for comments on International Prime sub growth.
We're not going to update our Prime subscription growth beyond what we said last year at the end of last year, which last year in a year when we raised prices early in 2014.
We continue to launch other Prime benefits, Amazon Pantry in Japan and Germany this quarter.
We launch Prime Now in the U.K. So, it's very similar to the U.S. story, potentially time lagged a bit, but we are seeing the same customer adoption and impact on growth rates.
Now, at this scale I know with the 50% plus growth rates that you just mentioned, if you roll the clock two or three years, one can see Prime penetration in markets like the U.S. starting to saturate as there are just so many homes in the country.
We think it's an interesting part of the selection offer for Prime and it's, in many ways, something that we can do that others can't, because it's a natural evolution of our 20-year effort to grow our fulfillment center network and our scale quite frankly makes it possible to even offer this to customers.
We think we have Ã¢ÂÂ we're attractive both to customers and to sellers and we like our position.
So continuing to work on Prime.
We continue to see really strong usage growth across the board, and it's coming from customers of all sizes.
And then the second question is North America and EGM growth accelerating again this quarter.
Worldwide revenue grew 23% to $25.4 billion, or 30% excluding the $1.3 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customers were approximately 272 million, up from approximately 244 million in the comparable prior-year period.
North America segment operating income includes $11 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
EGM revenue grew 14% to $5.9 billion, or 32% excluding foreign exchange.
International segment operating loss includes $64 million of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
AWS segment operating income includes $78 million of favorable impact from foreign exchange.
Consolidated segment operating income was $993 million or 3.9% of revenue, up approximately 460 basis points year-over-year.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
This guidance anticipates approximately 340 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, GAAP operating income to be between $80 million and $1.28 billion compared to $591 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expense to be between $700 million and $1.9 billion compared to $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter 2014.

amazon,q4,2015,"These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth, due to investments in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $9.7 billion or 27.1% of sales, up approximately 100 basis points year-over-year.
As a reminder, in the first quarter we changed our reportable segments to report North America, international, and Amazon web services.
North America segment operating income was $1 billion, a 4.7% operating margin, compared with $733 million in the prior year period.
Excluding the $1.1 billion year-over-year unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 22%.
In the Amazon Web Services segment, revenue grew 69% to $2.4 billion.
Amazon Web Services segment operating income was $687 million, a 28.5% operating margin, compared with $240 million in the prior year period.
Did we see more aggressive promotional activity and maybe talk about how you tried to work that to continue to drive the Prime number of members going forward?
Can you help give us a sense as to maybe what we're trying to accomplish with that, if it's defensive to protect your service to your existing customers or if you're looking to maybe start new businesses with those assets?
On gross margin, I would - first I'll caution you and say, we would encourage you to look at free cash flow, which was Ã¢ÂÂ grew at minimum of $4 billion on each of the metrics that we point out and our profit which was up 88% year-over-year.
And the operational improvements, excuse me, the gross margin, operating margin year-over-year that we've seen in the AWS business has been heavily driven by operating efficiencies, both purchase reductions and purchase prices and also efficiency in driving greater utilization of the assets that we have.
So very, very pleased with the critical acclaim to the Amazon Studios content and we've got a lot of new content coming out this year.
So it's still early, but we're encouraged and we think we're creating some value, a lot of value for our business customers.
I think you added well over a billion in revenue year-on-year in the quarter, but from a CSOI perspective, you really didn't see any improvement there.
I just wondered if you could unpack that a little bit and give us a sense of, you know, what profitability looks like maybe in some of your more mature, established countries and regions, relative to the investments you were making in other countries, so that we can kind of get a better picture of what's actually going on under the hood there?
And then second, last quarter, and I don't want to misquote you, but you said something along the lines of being able to invest as you'd like and also deliver good profit and that the pendulum wouldn't swing as far perhaps as it has in the past.
We didn't break it out by segment, but we said that Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 run rate, revenue growth rate.
As I said in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for fulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance and much greater FBA share, and not to mention all the investments in AWS, we are constantly looking for cost efficiencies and fixing variable productivity.
We've heard the comments about the number of availability zones that are being launched this year, which is obviously about, a big part of driving incremental capacity in that business and just trying to balance those, think about how we should balance those three things?
Most of our capacity and capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers demand growth.
On a dollar basis, we continue to grow Ã¢ÂÂ we saw the greatest growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and, again, we continue to invent, now with our price, we continue to innovate on behalf of customers and see great customer response.
In terms of expectations, I think we were pleased with what we saw this Q4 and, you know, if you look at what we gave for guidance, we were in the upper half of the range there for revenue.
And if you look at some of our new offerings like Prime Now that's available through a mobile app and very convenient for customers.
In lieu of that, can you comment on whether 4Q saw higher than usual costs for streaming content compared to other quarters in the year?
So your question about the AWS margins, that business as they continued to learn and as we continue to invent and get better at designing and operating the infrastructure and assets, we have been able to drive costs out of that business.
There's also an FX tailwind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter, which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises because we're largely priced in dollars, but have assets with local currency costs throughout the world.
I want to just quickly revisit the margin pendulum question and some of your comments, as you mentioned that to kind of expect it to ebb and flow.
On the speed of delivery, this is Phil, you know, all I can say is the customers love the service.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's view as of today, January 28, 2016 only, and will include forward-looking statements.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow less lease principle repayments increased to $4.7 billion, up from $529 million.
Excluding customers who only had free orders in the preceding 12-month period, worldwide active customer accounts were approximately 280 million, up from approximately 254 million in the comparable prior year period.

amazon,q1,2016,"These capital expenditures and capital leases reflect additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investment in technology infrastructure, the majority of which is to support AWS, and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
In the first quarter of 2016, we began to allocate stock-based compensation and other operating expense net to our segment results.
For reference, this quarter, I'll also mention segment operating income excluding stock-based compensation and other.
North America segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $588 million, a 3.5% operating margin compared with $254 million in the prior year.
International segment operating loss, including stock-based compensation and other, was $121 million, compared with a loss of $194 million in the prior year.
International segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $20 million, compared with a loss of $76 million in the prior year.
Amazon Web Services segment operating income, including stock-based compensation and other, was $604 million, a 23.5% operating margin compared with $195 million in the prior year.
Consolidated segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $1.7 billion or 5.7% of revenue, compared to $706 million in the prior year.
Your first question on international, yes, all three segments had very strong growth in the quarter.
As we may have mentioned in the past, we feel that Europe and large countries in Europe and Japan are a few years behind the U.S. on a lot of the key Prime metrics, but we also said last year that Prime subscriptions were up 51% year-over-year in 2015, 47% in the U.S. and a higher rate than that internationally.
So certainly, a lot going on in international, a lot that's really good, adding Prime subscribers at a high clip, continuing to add selection at FBA sellers.
Just wanted to ask you about unit growth overall and if we look back over the last three quarters, you've accelerated it now to a materially higher level than what we saw in 2014 and the first half of 2015, and I realize in 3Q last year you had Prime Day. And as you open up six new regions in coming months, should we expect this to be constant build-out or something that's more lumpy over time and more in waves?
I think when we look at the bridges for revenue, and obviously units are a key driver of revenue, things like Prime are key in that bridge.
We're very pleased with the quarter, we came in at 23.5% operating margin on a Ã¢ÂÂ the new basis including stock-based compensation and other.
But stepping back with the 64% growth in AWS which is now a $10 billion business, but on the margin side, I would caution you that we're pleased but it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the long-term margins in this business, they'll be bumpy over time.
At any point in time they're going to reflect the balance of investing including global expansion that he's talked about, price reductions we may offer, and also driving cost efficiency, which for us is a very important driver in not only this business but also the North America and international segments.
And on your AWS footprint question, so we ended the quarter with 33 Availability Zones in 12 geographic regions, and we have five Ã¢ÂÂ 11 more Availability Zones opening in the next year.
We love the Ã¢ÂÂ customers love the content and we like the results we see, particularly around Prime free trial conversion and renewal rates for subscribers who use and take advantage of Prime.
But we think that's working and look forward to bringing a lot of new content to our Prime subscriber base, both through our normal Prime subscription and also the monthly plan that you alluded to.
We will continue to add fulfillment capacity, we will work with FBA sellers on inventory stocking and timing and we think that there's things that we can do better as we do every year, come out of fourth quarter with immense learnings.
And secondly, Brian, you said that the growth of Prime has been driven by investments you have made and are making.
So we think there's a lot of room to grow in not only our international countries, but also in the U.S. So we plan on continuing to build the benefits of the Prime program from music to video, to two-day shipping, to same-day shipping, to Prime Now. And again, it remains the best deal in retail.
We're very pleased with the results we're seeing on the top and bottom line, but margins are going to be bumpy and affected by levels of investing, price reductions and also cost efficiencies that we're driving.
Wanted to understand how we should think about the puts and takes in gross margin, it has evolved to be a much higher number over the last couple of years, what some of the puts and takes are going forward especially with respect to content costs?
I think the bigger issues that you should look at in gross margin, and again starting with the comment that we expanded by 300 basis points year-over-year, that is really driven by, first of all, the AWS growth and again, $10 billion business growing 64% is very Ã¢ÂÂ we're very pleased with that and that affects gross margin as well.
So we have stepped up investment, although it did not go up as much year-over-year this quarter, we are still spending almost $10 billion on what essentially is fulfillment capacity in support of really strong growth, unit growth and FBA, and global expansion and then also on AWS, additional capacity for existing customers as they grow their business and also new regions.
We are not in the business of raising prices, we lower prices for AWS, so there can be mix for products, but by and large, if you see our revenue growth, know that we are also lowering prices which means that by math, we are typically going to be growing usage at a very strong rate.
And it's a lot of the drivers we talked about, as Brian mentioned on the revenue growth side, Prime, selection, growth.
Yes. And on AmazonFresh, we continue to have a strong Fresh business in a number of cities in the U.S. We know customers love it.
I think you see the growth rate of the segment at 27%.
The other thing I would add to that is that the margin you see in any quarter is really the output of our rate of investment at some places and drive for efficiencies in others.
The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 28, 2016 only and will include forward-looking statement.
Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 44% to $11.3 billion.
Trailing 12-month free cash flow less finance lease principal repayment and assets acquired under capital leases increased to $1.6 billion, up from an outflow of $1.2 billion.
Worldwide revenue increased 28% to $29.1 billion or 29% excluding the $210 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange.
These amounts are combined and titled stock-based compensation and other in our segment results and reflect the way we now evaluate our business performance and manage our operations.
North America segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $924 million, a 5.4% operating margin compared with $517 million in the prior year.
Media revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion or 9% excluding foreign exchange.
Amazon Web Services segment operating income before stock-based compensation and other was $716 million, a 27.9% operating margin compared with $265 million in the prior year.
Inventory increased 30% to $9.6 billion and inventory turns were 8.6, down from 8.8 turns a year ago as we expand selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisition, investments, restructurings or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth, JPMorgan.
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Can you talk about how you're thinking about planning against that as the Prime flywheels are getting broader for you, how do you try to get ahead of that into the peak season later this year?
Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
I think it's a mathematical certainty that Prime subscribers will decelerate in North America at some point from 50% growth.
So over 26% growth in this quarter alone coming off a year where I believe the number was 722 significant new features and services delivered for AWS customers last year.

Amazon Web Services' operating income was $718 million, a 24.9% operating margin compared with $305 million in the prior year.
This guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
Our guidance also assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings or legal settlements and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Our next question comes from Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray.
Our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs.
Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer.
Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Robert W.
Our next question comes from Brian Pitz from Jefferies.
So I would just say Prime Day had enormous impact on the device business and devices were well featured and also well adopted by customers.
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Yeah, let me talk a little bit about guidance and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question.
So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later.
And we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows Ã¢ÂÂ TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year.
I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend.
In terms of questions, the customer count, can you give us a little bit of guidance on that?
And then also talk about the theme of automated consumption and separately, the importance of Prime Now and how you can kind of grow those SKUs. Darin Manney - Director, Head of Investor Relations, Amazon
Of course, we do always talk about Ã¢ÂÂ we always usually get asked about profitability and it is a very hard service to deliver and make money on, but we know customers love it and we're in a great position to do this because of our long-term approach, our drive of greater efficiencies and our proximity to the customer with our vast global FC network.
I was wondering as it relates to the Q3 guidance, can you give us a bit of a sense of just how we should think about margins in the AWS business, especially as the next eight availability zones roll out?
But to your question about AWS, we actually see nine availability zones in four regions coming out in the next Ã¢ÂÂ in the coming year.
The impact on short-term is pretty much indistinguishable from the growth that we're seeing in our expansion of our base customers in our existing regions, so we don't see a large step-up from the addition of new regions relative to the large and rapid growth in the business itself.
As I look at your tech and content expense as a percentage of revenues, we see year-on-year decline for the last two quarters, which is something we hadn't seen since mid-2010, and of course it's reflected in the AWS margins.
So, there's a lot of great work going on there and I think that's what you're seeing reflected in the tech and content line.
So, the move into Boston and also now into London give us some really good data points and as Ã¢ÂÂ it's a great customer feature for the Prime offering.
Some of the products overlap, of course, but we're happy with both, and we think that customers like both of them.
I remember last quarter you called out really starting to see, kind of I don't know, critical mass tipping point, whatever the buzzword is, from Prime and from FBA in international markets.
So it's a bit as simple as that in the consumer business in North America and international, we are seeing great acceptance of Prime and usage of Prime benefits.
We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable, and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice-versa.
We've talked a bit about our Prime launch in India, and alluded to the fact that we'll be having video soon in India, but local content and also Amazon Originals.
So we take both roles very seriously around here, investing on the right Ã¢ÂÂ in the right things, seeing results on behalf of customers, and also driving efficiencies.
And there can be timing, quarter-to-quarter, the operating margin and levels of investment can fluctuate, but certainly continue to expand.
We are certainly expanding our service offerings in the transportation side and we have been for many years, things like sortation centers and delivery methods.
And then second thing, when you look at the U.S. Prime penetration versus total U.S. customers, how do you feel about that and do you think there's still a lot of room for Prime growth in the U.S.?
We know that, again, when customers try Prime, they like it.
Let me take that first question on Prime Air in the UK, we've been working with and developing Prime Air for some time to develop a rapid delivery system that is safe, environmentally sound and it really enhances the services that we provide for millions of customers.
You heard that we launched the Prime program this week, which will be a whole new experience for Indian customers.
We think it'll enter into a new chapter in India, and we've seen great success every country in the world that we've launched Prime, and we feel India is going to be no different.
So, yes, this is really to support both the customers that we have there in Italy and throughout Europe, and we'll continue to invest in the coming years.
",62.82,0.9723831
amazon,q3,2016,"We're also investing in digital content and additional Prime benefits, fresh location Prime Now. But by far the biggest individual thing is the investment in India that we continue to make and very excited about it, the initial reaction in India from both the customers and also sellers.
I guess when we think about the progression of margins in the second half versus the second half of 2015 and kind of the flat-lining of overall margin at this point excluding AWS, I guess should we think about this as being a temporary kind of plateau that will at some point resume once you start leveraging the fulfillment build-out?
Well we will continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction.
Most of those are in North America but that compares to 14 last year and I would look, looking back the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter.
So we continue to build for high AFN, or Amazon Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA.
So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is a step-up investment primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service, think (7:54) rapid growth in that business.
In the past, I think you've talked about how it takes time to kind of get the fulfillment centers to peak efficiencies, so with these new FCs opening, could you just talk about it?
On the AWS question, yeah, we continue to invest in AWS on behalf of our customers in addition to the technologies that make integrations easier that helps companies move from an on-prem or a hybrid IT environment into AWS.
So we're going to continue to do that, specifically things like the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when they move production databases from on premises to the cloud with virtually no downtime.
So yeah, were doing a lot of things to help make it easier for all customers to migrate to AWS.
And how big that, any way to help us quantify how big that already is to the revenue growth that you're seeing, particularly on groceries and any particular comments on fashion and apparel, same line of thinking?
Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it's a very attractive service to our customers, which is what we're after.
So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers and we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs.
And Prime Now, we're also very happy with, although obviously the economics in that business are even tougher, but we do feel that our scale makes that possible because of the geographic footprint and how close we already are to customers.
We continue to work with brands to come on board and we're happy with the traction we're seeing with those brands.
Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. To answer your question about was that part of investment.
Yes, this is certainly part of our investment but the large ramp, if you will, in investment that we're seeing from the back end of last year and also the first half of this year is more related to digital content and the build in our fulfillment network, which I've already discussed.
And the biggest issue you're trying to get at is having the most valuable products for holiday in the warehouse in the Prime space and not having the warehouse filled with things that may not sell until after the New Year.
But the things that we're seeing hit the P&L are the fixed and variable expenses that it takes to run the building and I think that's what Brian's pointing out most pointedly in terms of what is impacting the profitability of the second half.
Your question on fulfillment expenses, I can't extend the guidance into next year.
A follow-up on the FC question, and I guess more specifically it sounds like you have enough capacity in terms of fulfillment centers for the holidays, but also wondering what your comfort level is in terms of your shipping partners to manage those deliveries.
So yeah, we looking forward to a great holiday and that includes working with our shipping partners both in the U.S. and globally.
I guess when you look at fourth quarter guidance and you back out AWS, it suggests that margins are, on the core business, are going to be pretty down versus last year.
Yes. As far as the continuation of the investment into next year, I cannot give you much color on that today.
We are experiencing a ramp-up, if you will, in the second half of this year particularly tied again to AWS, or excuse me, the fulfillment center spend and also the video content spend.
We'll continue to invest in things that we believe enhance the customer experience, particularly the Prime experience.
We are honing the businesses that we're in and making them as efficient, as profitable as possible while also investing very pointedly and very wisely, we believe, in things that will enhance customer experience and create lasting businesses for us down the line.
The investment that we are seeing is a step-up versus what we have experienced in particularly the first half of this year and the last half, the second half of last year which I mentioned.
So we will try different delivery methods or pick-up points or ways of getting product to customers, but nothing specific to point out on the grocery side right now.
And as Brian pointed out earlier, our AFN unit, our Amazon fulfilled units, which include our first-party units as well as FBA units that go through our warehouses are continuing, are certainly higher than that 28%.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. So thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions.

Our next question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen & Company.
",59.47,0.78503
amazon,q4,2016,"So yes, what you are seeing, John, is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year.
And then separately as it relates to just the video service, from a positioning standpoint in the market, how do you think about the unique aspects of the product that Amazon has relative to others in the market in terms of the aggregation tools that are being provided now where some of the value is being perceived longer-term?
Well, ultimately, I'll step back and say one of the main things we look out on Prime Video is customer usage patterns and in 2016 we had a doubling of Prime hours for video, music and reading.
I'll also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the second half of last Ã¢ÂÂ or, excuse me, in Q4.
Yes, the investment did step up in the second half of last year, including marketing.
The offering in China that we have for consumers is also a great, trusted customer engagement.
We continue to say that, but we are very encouraged with what we've created with customers and sellers alike in India over the last few years.
We will continue to build our business there and continue to do a great job for both customers and sellers.
But we like the initial engagement we're seeing and the response from, again, both customers and sellers.
And then my whether question is whether you can shed any more light on the motivation to build out the air cargo hub in Cincinnati, understanding the need to support the growth of the core retail business, but also if this gives you more of an opportunity to build out direct connections to suppliers, for example, or a longer-term offer excess capacity or logistics as a service.
And, sorry, the second question is on the hub in Cincinnati Ã¢ÂÂ or excuse me, in Kentucky.
But the engagement is just like any other Prime benefit or investment that we have.
So it's a great, again, part of the flywheel in that, Echo and Alexa make the devices better and it builds engagement, not only with Echo and Alexa, but also with Amazon.
We continue to add Prime members and similar to the flywheel that Brian was just mentioning, that the FBA selection helps us with engaging customers and in particular the Prime program.
So we're very pleased with our customer engagement this year.
So as you point out, we've had Amazon Logistics deliveries in the UK for more years than some of our other countries and what we see is it gives us control of the shipment for a lot longer.
I think it's a great value to our customers.
But we test, we innovate, we think the bookstores for instance are a really great way for customers to engage with our devices and see them, touch them, play with them and become fans.
Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. But I will say on Ã¢ÂÂ you're talking about the levels of engagement now that we're seeing versus what would be the long-term model over time.
So, we see a double benefit of the global Prime Video program, again both to amortize the investment in original content but also to show that original content to more and more people, because we think it's done really well.
We think it's won a lot of awards and we've worked with some Ã¢ÂÂ again some great, talented people.

We've been pretty clear that this business is all about creating new functionality for customers, giving price cuts and then working on the operating efficiencies.
The other data point I'll give you that affects our cost structure is our Amazon Fulfilled units, which is the combination of retail plus FBA, grew nearly 40% last year and that compares to our paid unit growth of 24% in Q4.
Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W.

I guess it would be curious to hear how you think about the importance of an Amazon brick and mortar presence and how that fits into the long-term strategy?

We've had Ã¢ÂÂ customers migrated more than 23,000 data basis using the AWS Database Migration Service since that launched last year.
Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.
Brian, I had a couple questions about your growing advertising business.
And then second, I think it's fairly obvious why someone selling within the Amazon ecosystem would be interested in promoting on the platform, but maybe tell us a little bit about maybe over the long-term there are opportunities for sort of non-endemic advertisers within your platform.
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
And the fulfillment centers I'll also say with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses, and then they generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start-up.
Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W.
Let me start with your middle question.
Let me step back and talk about international growth in general.
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS.
So I'm not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates, other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into Q1.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
We just opened up Amazon Fresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business B2B business just opened up in the UK.
The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip than our paid unit growth.
And then secondly on these Ã¢ÂÂ on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within households?
We think as engagement Ã¢ÂÂ as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole.
And the big picture is, again, as we've said customers Ã¢ÂÂ the things customers love can grow to be large, we'll have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades.
Things like Prime Music, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, all expanding globally.
We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled unit is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity.
You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones.
We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses and we're also developing services for AWS customers.
But I think the general theme is there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about, and we continue to ramp those investments.
So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon Robotics areas.
Brian, I think you mentioned the accelerating growth within AWS on new products and last year you added about 1,000.
You clearly see our Ã¢ÂÂ we break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and operating income, and you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those.
So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity.
Just curious if you'd say Ã¢ÂÂ have you made a lot of progress in terms of catching up with some of the fulfillment needs that you saw necessary in the business at the beginning of last year?
And then I know you just said that you're Ã¢ÂÂ it's still early days in terms of advertising, but there's a perception out there that over the last year or so that the company has sort of really begun to focus more on this business opportunity.
Our scale and number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs, and new content Ã¢ÂÂ video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business.
We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers Ã¢ÂÂ for FBA sellers.
We're not breaking out the specific growth rates for Prime, but certainly it Ã¢ÂÂ we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been consistent with what we have seen over the last quarter or so.
You talked a lot about the fulfillment centers, but could you update us on where we are in terms of rolling out Prime Now facilities and sorting centers?
Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sort centers, right.
Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. We're still growing that and we're happy with the progress in Prime Now and the service that Ã¢ÂÂ the value that it creates for Prime customers.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. Thank you for joining us on our call today and for your questions.

amazon,q2,2017,"Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
The other dynamic is that, similar to last year, a large percentage of our new fulfillment centers are coming online in the second half of the year, a lot of them in Q3.
Other than that, can't give much more specifics except to say that the large investment areas remain the increasing fulfillment capacity to service the strong growth of the FBA business.
On your larger question about what the place of Amazon Fresh, likely Prime Now and some of our other efforts, I would say we believe there'll be no one solution, so we're experimenting with a number of the formats from physical pickup points in Amazon Go to online ordering and delivery to your door through Prime Now and Amazon Fresh.
So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments, what we were within the guidance range and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistics services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa, Echo devices and Alexa platform India, the buildup at the AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned not to mention Prime Now and Amazon Fresh and Prime benefits.
Right now, what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising.
So, I saw firsthand the customer experience, I think, that's what we're seeing as a benefit to the physical stores right now.
Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. So, yes, we've had numerous price decreases, and we continue to have that in the AWS business, both absolute decreases in service costs and also rolling out new services that may be cannibalizing more expensive other services that we provide.
What I can say, the biggest dynamic going on again is that Amazon fulfilled unit growth of nearly 40%, which was last year and carrying into this year.
We are matching that with just over 30% increase in square footage, and you're right, that does include some shipping sort centers and things that are incremental and new functions for us, if you will.
I just wanted to follow up on AWS, and just on the back of the price cut, obviously 1Q being the first full quarter, but it looks like 2Q, as Mark said, things did stabilize some.
On AWS, yes, we are seeing great customer adoption.
So the AWS revenue growth showed almost no change but the AWS operating margin was lower I guess than we've seen in, I don't know, six quarters or something like that.
And again, we like what we see and we'll continue to expand that and we'll be working very hard on making that not only a valuable Prime offering, a Prime benefit, but also a lower-cost operation as well.
I would just like to use that maybe as a springboard to talk a little bit about what you think the right mix is for how you sell in terms of self-service versus salespeople.
On operating margins internationally, I would step back and say a lot of the investments we're making in North America we're also making in international.
Prime benefits including Prime Video and remember we launched Global Video in Q4 of last year to 200 countries, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, the general rise of FBA and added selection, both retail and FBA to make Prime more attractive, and the fulfillment and logistics costs that go with that, and the additional constant effort to reduce prices and accelerate shipping.
Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. So thank you, Brian, and thank you all for joining us on the call today and for your questions.
We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Our first question comes from line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Or should we think about adding different modes such as pick up points and bricks and mortar as serving a distinct customer base or geared to reduce the cost bottleneck around home delivery?
May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Could you characterize or maybe even quantify how much of the fulfillment infrastructure investment that you're making is kind of incremental, is geared towards handling growth and sort of the existing business and infrastructure versus expanding your capabilities in fulfillment, like adding more inbound or last mile and/or from entering new international markets where you need to invest ahead of growth versus just sort of keeping up and maintaining growth within sort of your existing footprint?
Our usage in all of our large services are actually accelerating and they're growing at a rate higher than our revenue growth.

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
In particular, there's a lot of talk now about potentially using Whole Foods stores for a physical pharmacy presence and also that you've perhaps gotten approvals across multiple states in that category.
And we think we'll be also developing new store formats and everything else just as we talked about in the past before Whole Foods.
Our next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi.
Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays.
Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
And particularly how the company and management thinks about entering more regulated businesses over time, how you would approach that versus a standard category that you might go into or maybe again knowing you can't comment on rumors, how you have approached that in the past or in other markets.
Our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Stifel.
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.
Our final question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
We launched month-to-month Prime last year and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go, so there's less that's deferred.
But if you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores, launching the Whole Foods private label products on Amazon, the technical (06:07) work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future.
A lot of the building blocks that we've been working on, all the Prime benefits, advancements in free shipping offers or faster shipping offers, the Prime benefits would drive engagement, of course, adding selection, adding Fulfilled by Amazon partners and the selection that they bring.
I think over time, you'll see more cooperation and working together between AmazonFresh, Prime Now, and Whole Foods as we can explore different ways to serve the customer.
In this line item, is certainly the fees associated with Amazon Prime and also it's where a lot of our subscription services for digital music, digital video, audiobooks, e-books, so there's some moving parts in there.
And again, on the other subscription services, music especially, it works just so well with our Echo device that we're seeing a lot of growth in that area as we increase the number of Echo devices and customers using the Echo devices.
We continued to hire a lot of sales reps and it's tied directly to our major investment areas of AWS, Prime Video and devices.
As I said, there will be a lot of work together between Prime Now, AmazonFresh, Whole Foods, Whole Foods products on the Amazon site, Amazon Lockers at the Whole Foods stores.
So, we're really excited about that and I think working together, will bring our different strengths to the table and really be able to build on behalf of customers.
And in terms of the increased losses in the international retail segment of the business, can you provide some color around how much of that's being driven by Amazon launching into new markets, which I know you continue to do, versus investing more heavily in existing markets?
We had the first Prime Day there this year, Prime Music, Amazon Business is also expanding in India.
In video, if you remember in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings, but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers.
I understand you can't comment on rumors one way or the other but curious, as you think about categories like health care and, obviously, you guys are already in health care to some degree through Amazon Business, can you give us a bit of a status update on what you do have out there now?
It's because the video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers.
We're seeing the engagement go up year-after-year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime benefits.
So Whole Foods, I think I mentioned this earlier, but we definitely see commonality and overlap with the Whole Foods business as well as Amazon in total, but specifically Prime Now and also AmazonFresh.
On the ad supported question, I think what you've seen to-date is really particularly as you're looking as a customer, as a Prime Video member and watching content, we view that as you've paid into that service and able to watch those shows ad free.
Just wanted to ask about delivery and just over the last several months, we've seen a lot of announcements and products around delivery options between Lockers, the testing of the Kohl's partnership, Whole Foods obviously, Amazon Key came out recently, just wanted to better understand this investment.

So the fact that we came in at the high end of the range, volume was high, especially in North America, and a lot of times in Q4 and other quarters actually, we see better efficiencies when the warehouses were busy.
It's a very positive surprise for us both on a -- adding a little bit more to that, we had record device sales with very high levels of customer engagement, including increased levels of voice shopping, growth in functionality, growth in our partner, partners we work with, skills that we've increased rapidly, we're over 30,000 skills for Alexa.
We do like the results we're seeing with engagement on customers, their buying habits, their engagement with the Video content, their use of it on devices and we will continue to increase our budget in that area.
So it looks like it grew about 31% up on shipping costs in the quarter, and that's been kind of moving in tandem with the Amazon fulfilled unit growth.
So shipping cost is always going to be a strong part of our offering, and we're -- it's going to be increasing due to our business model, and we, at the same time, look then to minimize the cost by getting more and more efficient in that area, AWS, yes, if you remember last year, we did have price increases in December of last year towards the end.
We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website, and we're -- the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program and we expect to have more on that later in the year.
So we're -- continue to be pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in the international countries as well and also in that numbers.
And the second one , Brian, to go back to an earlier question on areas of investment this year, you didn't talk a whole lot about kind of new categories to expand into beyond the old retail business.
Yes, and on new businesses or expansion of categories, as you discussed, I would not talk to anything that's not been publicly announced, but on some of the ones you mentioned, they are underway and are continuing.
I would say on the category side, that the biggest effort will be on continuing to be on groceries and consumables with the Whole Foods acquisition and again, we continue to look at our whole offering of AmazonFresh, Prime Now, Whole Foods, how can they work together to create better and better offerings for our customer base.
Hey, guys, so I wanted to go back to, and I think you said one of the biggest focuses of the year is going to be on the consumables now, Fresh, Whole Foods.
Not just the Whole Foods but just generally across the consumables business in Fresh and Now. I'd say Whole Foods is not less in their commitment to providing the best selection of high-quality products and having them in stock for customers.
And certainly there's other verticals that I didn't mention there that we're interested in continuing to kind of learn from customers what they want and what they're looking for there, and so we'll keep adding selection.
So as an internal customer, the consumer business is very happy with AWS.
And I think AWS is also very benefited by the fact that they have a large internal beta customer that tries out and uses a lot of their products and services.
Yes, I mean, I think right now, we're really just focused on finding ways to work with those companies, whether it's vendors or sellers that are coming to us, and offer them a great experience on the website and ability to be able to reach customers.
Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, February 1, 2018, only and will include forward-looking statements.
In our fourth quarter results, we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the new tax legislation of approximately $789 million, which is primarily driven by the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities, resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.
Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
So particularly in North America, I would say there's the volume -- the strong volume -- top line volume, combined with increased advertising revenues and also very clean operational performance.
Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with J.P. Morgan.
We're [indiscernible] $20 billion run rate in top line revenues for AWS, up from 18% -- actually $18 billion last quarter.
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Our next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Our next question comes from the line of Ken Sena with Wells Fargo.

amazon,q1,2018,"The Prime program continues to drive great strength in our top line, as you've seen over the last few years actually.
We continue to increase the value of Prime, including speed selection and digital entertainment options.
Beginning in the first quarter, sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are now presented on a net revenue basis and included in third-party seller services revenue, rather than that online stores revenue.
Again, beginning in the first quarter, we now recognize annual Prime membership revenue straight line over the 12-month period.
So as far as the Whole Foods, specifically on the question of what we'll look at as far as expanding that grocery delivery, we're going to use the 10 cities as a test and see how customers respond, just like we always do, and make sure that our deliveries are great for those people, and then we'll announce expansion plans once we digest that, the feedback we get from customers.
So first, with the Ã¢ÂÂ you've mentioned North America revenue growth, and you can calculate that with and without the impact of Whole Foods, I'm sure.
So we see strong customer demand, not only for the benefits that we associate with Prime, we're seeing better engagement with Prime benefits, especially digital benefits, and that is always good news for eventual sales of other things.
And in terms of the accounting change that Dave referenced earlier with regard to revenue going from cost of revenue to the other line, can you comment if that particular type of advertising, that trade dollars type of marketing, is that growing at a meaningfully different rate than the ad revenue that's already booked as revenue?
On that second question, we've not commented on the growth rate or given the prior year period, so not much we can say there.
As I said, the $560 million, if you were to back that out and look at the sort of pre-existing advertised Ã¢ÂÂ or other revenue rather that was included in that line item, we'd be growing about 72%.
First, the top-line growth was Ã¢ÂÂ continued to be strong coming out of Q4.
We also had strong AWS revenue strength, where I already mentioned that we accelerated into the quarter, which is a different trend that we've seen recently.
And then finally, as part of advertising, you've got also a heck of a lot inventory around all of that video, that Prime Video that you have that you don't allow Ã¢ÂÂ that you don't directly charge for, how do you think about that as an advertising revenue opportunity?
Yeah, I think the only thing I'd add to on that just related to Prime Video, as you may have seen in the announcement earlier today about the renewed agreement for the streaming partnership with Thursday Night Football.
So we'll have 11 games in 2018 and 2019, be able to deliver that to over 100 million Prime members globally, which is a great continuation of the partnership we've had with the NFL.
So, yeah, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the main point, is selection and opportunities for sellers in Ã¢ÂÂ who are with us in different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country.
So in terms of your question of sort of impact from the first-party piece that's been coming online, many of those states came on over a period of time to get to that 45 total, going back over many years.
So there's all kinds of new features that we've continually added to the Prime program.
Yeah I don't want to project relative proportions of the different segments, but what I can say is the international continues to see the same level of investment as we're seeing in North America or have seen in North America.
We'll continue to invest in India where we're seeing great progress with both sellers and also customers.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our first question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.
So our philosophy there again is we're continuing to focus on finding valuable ways to make our advertising opportunities better for customers, showing them new products that they may not have seen otherwise and also for emerging and established brands, helping them to reach customers.
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
So what we're saying is just continued strong usage both by existing customers and signing new customers for Ã¢ÂÂ see increased pace of enterprise migrations as customers are having success with AWS and increasingly trying new services.
And we have proven operational capability and security expertise that's highly valued to the AWS customer base.
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Our main goal here is to help customers discover new brands and products.
So we show the sponsored products, we're trying to show people things they had maybe wouldn't have seen otherwise in their normal search results.
Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
I mentioned that four years ago when we last increased the price of Prime, you could get 20 million products within two days.
Our next question comes from...

amazon,q2,2018,"Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.
You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again increasing usage at our customers; usage rates are exceeding our growth rate.
Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
I mean, in any quarter there can be product mix or ASP differentials which shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver Shipping threshold twice, the early part of last year from $49 to $35; and then down to $25.
We're seeing a lot of our growth areas being fueled by head count that's moving within the company.
Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi.
Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
How successful Ã¢ÂÂ you mentioned database, but what other areas you're potentially seeing as customers move up the stack with you and grow?
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
And they're using our services to achieve their marketing goals to Ã¢ÂÂ whether that's to drive new brand awareness, discovery or ultimately purchase decisions on our site.
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS.
We have the delivery services Ã¢ÂÂ so AmazonFresh and Prime Now which serve a certain need.
Our final question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Company.
Even while in International, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas, we continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies, we continue to launch new countries as we launch Prime in Australia recently.
So continued Ã¢ÂÂ it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow, and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts.
And then Brian, I'm sorry, you just talked better than expected efficiencies in operations, could I ask you to tease that out a little bit more, and a little more color particularly on the retail side of the business?
On operations, if you look at probably the last 18 months, you're going to see a lot of different pace of increase in both infrastructure costs and capital costs, and the addition of fixed cost heads.
So one thing that you'll notice is that, we've grown Ã¢ÂÂ we've stepped down our rate of growth of fixed head count, excluding the acquisitions we've grown 26% year-over-year at the end of June, on a trailing 12 month basis.
We don't think that, that's necessarily the long-term trend, but it certainly created a lot of operating efficiencies, and now we'll reset and evaluate where we need to still add people.
So I think the first half of the year could be a good test of where our cost structure is, coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday.
I'll probably clarify that at the end of next quarter as we head into holiday, but if you think back, the last two years, we've added square footage that's exceeded 30% growth, both in 2016 and 2017.
And I think, the second question was just related to how is Alexa impacting the business, overall.
I mean, I think, we're having a lot of success with devices and customers are enjoying those.
We talked to coming out of Prime Day, had some good success and happy customers enjoying some of the devices there.
So I think, that's a lot of Ã¢ÂÂ the focus now is really having a good and exciting roadmap of recent revises and more to come ahead, and getting those into customers' hands.
So it's a Ã¢ÂÂ there's a bit of timing at play here, but I think overall, in the longer-term, we certainly work to drive efficiency in both AWS infrastructure capability, and also in our warehouse networks.
Yeah, let me give Dave a chance afterwards to talk about that piece, but I'll start with advertising.
We think it's a big milestone this quarter to launch Prime benefits with Whole Foods, and we'll keep going, we'll see how that develops.
Of course we started in Music with Prime Music, a little bit earlier in that space, and I think that's been a great way for Prime members to enjoy some of that catalog for free, and then as they enjoy that, be able to move into the Amazon Music Unlimited skill.
So I think your original question was about monetization of Alexa, but right now the biggest thing we can do is to make it as useful as possible, and make devices that can use the skills.
Dave Fildes - Amazon.com, Inc. Thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions.

amazon,q3,2018,"Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
I guess the big one is the deceleration in unit growth or online stores, which are probably related to that.
We had two reactions on our Super Saver Shipping threshold in the first half of the year between February and May. That did spur a lot of unit growth in the second and third quarter.
And again, when we're talking about the unit deceleration, a lot of the fastest growing areas, things like subscription services, AWS and advertising are not caught in that metric.
So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continue to invest in Prime benefits, international expansion as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pickup.
We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple years and as we've funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas as we've talked about, AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of those roles.
Obviously in the last few quarters, you've seen accelerating revenue growth.
We've had sequential increase in growth rate the prior three quarters, I believe, it was.
Maybe can you just help us understand a little bit any of the specific categories or countries that have been the largest contributors to revenue growth throughout the course of this year?
Much of our, not only our revenue for the quarter, but also for the year comes in that very tight window between middle of November and the end of the year.
This year, we took Prime subscription revenue and amortized it over the quarters on a straight line method.
That has again been caught up for in prior quarters, but again not a huge factor on the growth rate for revenue, but just another item to consider.
With a lot of offline retailers talking more about omni-channel, wanted to understand sort of the investments you might be making around unifying the efforts with Whole Foods and Amazon Prime Now, speeding up delivery, giving consumers as much choice as possible and moving SKUs closer to households.
You'll see even this quarter we started to have greater expansion of our grocery delivery out of Whole Foods using Prime Now. We're now in 60 cities in the U.S., giving customers delivery in as fast as an hour on thousands of great organic products from Whole Foods.
And then maybe second question, I think what one of the things people are trying to think through is you obviously guide to revenue and operating income, but as the business is more than 3P and advertising, gross profit is now much more important and just the way you kind of capture the value you provide.
So maybe if you can Ã¢ÂÂ is there a way to just kind of help us kind of foot the perhaps slower revenue growth we're seeing versus what's obviously you extracting kind of more value for your partners and customers and for yourself?
Just quickly on the ASC impact, Brian mentioned earlier that of course we've been talking about it all year the changing, and the subscription revenue recognition is now straight line.
The other piece that we hadn't talked about is the reclass that we gave in the past few quarters, specifically around the advertising services that have moved from Contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018.
And your comment on revenue versus operating income versus potentially gross profit, I would say the impact of third-party growth and we're now Ã¢ÂÂ up to 53% of our paid units in the quarter were third-party.
So I think the impact on revenue growth rate, since the revenue component of that is not as large, is probably something to consider on a year-over-year period.
If we do this right, we think we'll both help advertisers and help Amazon consumers at the same time.
So I know it doesn't answer the question about specific rate increases or capacity, but that is the general strategy that we're seeing in advertising.
I mean I think so much of what we're focused on is making sure that there's a high degree of relevancy and usefulness for customers when you look at advertisements that you see on the site in particular and how we position those.
Let me start with the Amazon Prime price increase.
We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com, and look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC
But we've also had great cost performance this year in three specific areas I'll call out.
In our fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last two years, 2016 and 2017.
Making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Network units that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units.
May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. We are at an annualized run rate above $26 billion and that was about $18 billion this time last year.
So our guidance for the fourth quarter implies 10% to 20% growth and includes an 80-basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
We're not expecting a material impact from these rate changes in 2019.
It's up 300 basis points year-over-year.

And then secondly, just if you could remind us or help us understand the Prime accounting change impact on subscription revenues in Q4?

Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.

Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.
Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions.
I guess I'll ask about units, 14% in the quarter, just, how do you feel about the overall unit growth here, given that the growth was higher last year in the 20s and do you think there are some investments you can make in other areas to kind of reaccelerate that going forward?
Just on the second question on the subscription services, weÃ¢ÂÂd said on the last call, you probably remember, related to the adoption of the accounting standards update and revenue recognition policies that was impacting our results in a number of areas in 2018.
And on unit deceleration, I think the unit numbers more and more require some interpretation, because it doesn't include the -- some of our fastest growing areas, the things like, as Dave mentioned, subscription services, AWS, advertising, Whole Foods units are not in that number.
Just comment a little bit on the international revenue outlook and any commentary on India and whether you think there's a material impact on your business?
Headcount only grew 14% year-over-year, but the areas that were growing in that mix were things like technology teams, device areas, AWS, especially sales and marketing.
Brian talked a little bit about it before, but pleased with the holiday season, both from sort of a first party side, but also sellers continuing to do well.
When I try to back out the impact factors like Whole Foods, the advertising accounting change and other factors, what I see is stable and pretty healthy revenue growth for the retail segment, but a slowdown in Q4 from what seems to have been, in more recent quarters, meaningful gross margin expansion in the retail segment.
And then on capital, especially infrastructure capital, if you use the capital lease slide as maybe an indicator for what we have invested into our AWS business to support infrastructure and global expansion, that number grew 10% last year, when it had grown 69% in 2017.
Anything to read into that about sort of what your expectations are for growth in those businesses, seeing that reacceleration after the deceleration that we saw over the course of at least the first three quarters of last year.
I still think the 17% is a low number for us, when you talk about the -- supporting the AWS business that's still growing in a very high clip and a very strong and healthy growth in FBA and customer demand and our expansion into new countries, both with AWS and also with our core consumer business.
Can you just talk to any of the puts and takes we should know about from a gross margin perspective in the fourth quarter and then that other line that I think includes the advertising business, can you just help us, any help at all on the growth of the advertising business or the impact of any of the accounting changes in the quarter?
In the quarter, looking backwards, not considering India and the impact going forward, but the international growth accelerated, so I was curious any particular regions or product categories to call out, especially given some of the weakness in the UK?
We generally work to change the fees to make sure that the incentives are strong on both sides and we continue to have a healthy growth in third party.
And then just on your second question around advertising, if you look at the other revenue, the growth rate decelerated some.
On your comment or question on transportation, we do continue to expand our Amazon logistics and delivery capability and it also matches up with our faster ship speed that we're seeing for Prime members as well.

amazon,q1,2019,"Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Again, as I mentioned last quarter, it is a measurement, excludes a lot of our fastest growing businesses, things like AWS, advertising, subscription services, which cannibalize the unit calculation, things like Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Music Unlimited.
So you remember last quarter, I made the point that 2018 saw lower growth in some of our key cost areas.
We're able to do this, because we spent 20 plus years expanding our fulfillment and logistics network, but this is still a big investment and a lot of work to do ahead of us.
And just to clarify, to give a little more information, we have been offering, obviously, faster than Two-Day Shipping for Prime members for years, one day, same day, even down to one to two hour delivery for Prime Now. So we're going to continue to offer same day and Prime Now selection in an accelerated basis.
Our engagement in video benefit - excuse me, Prime benefits, shipping, hours watched on video, hours listened to on music, all of them are trending in the right direction and continue to get more and more sticky.
The advertising business saw what looks like a little bit of a step-down again in Q1 versus Q4.
So we're very - excuse me, the other point I'll make is just like last quarter, I'll remind you that the physical stores revenue is principally Whole Foods revenue, but it excludes the online ordering component where people order on the Prime Now app and it's delivered to them.
So last quarter, I told you that our growth in store sales, including both shopping and also online deliveries, was closer to 6% in Q4, and it's a similar number in Q1.
And then just a follow-up, just to return to the $800 million investment to improve one-day shipping, it sounds like that investment is underway already and that - in noting that it'll help contribute to the high-end of the guidance this quarter, it sounds like the timing of that is fairly quicker.
I would say that while our 20-year head start in investments in logistics and fulfillment capacity and partner networks that we've built are helping us, we also do have a network that is tuned to two-day delivery right now, principally for two-day delivery.
So we do need to build out more one-day capacity along with our transportation partners, but we're moving quickly and we've got a good head start.
So again, we feel like if we work on the inputs on this business and continue to grow traffic to the site, we will have a good outcome in the advertising space.
In the shareholder letter, Jeff wrote third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt, and we read through that, but as we kind of look at the trending and the pacing of the 3P business, you can see a little bit of a deceleration in the 3P sellers services line and then 3P unit slowdown might suggest that the third-party GMV expansion may not be happening quite as fast.
So again, the sellers are as important to us as anything for servicing the customers' need for price selection and convenience.
The elements I just talked about of investment, further investment in one-day shipping is directly going to be a cost that we bear and it's also going to be a direct benefit to sellers as well as the Prime eligible selection in our warehouses.
Just coming back to the Prime one-day delivery, will it be available to most of the U.S. by the holidays or by the end of the year?
And I think you had about 100 million items available for two-day delivery, Prime delivery.
Just on the grocery side of it, as you mentioned, Brian talked a bit about the Whole Foods Market growth over 500 stores, 75 metros with delivery capability, so continuing to grow that out.
And on the numbers, $800 million for the quarter, how should we think about that ramping into the back half of the year?
The operating margin has also expanded in that time period by 320 basis points as a result of a lot of the good work on infrastructure and efficiencies that I talked about earlier in the call, because this is against a backdrop of a very large expansion of our tech teams and our sales teams that supports this business.
We're really going to have to see how it goes this quarter, both on our pace of selection addition and expansion of one-day, and let you know probably at the end of the quarter.
I guess somewhat along those lines or at least along the lines of growth, we saw CapEx spending and investment in capital leases decelerate to the lowest rate that it's been in several years, maybe even the lowest rate ever.
I'm sure that's not representative of what you expect growth to look like.
The business in China is going really well and we continue to see strong growth there.

And then sort of the opposite question on AWS, which has slowed a little bit can you just talk about some of the puts and takes in the AWS revenue growth this quarter versus the prior Q?
So as you can tell, we've been pretty transparent with our AWS revenue and income numbers we've been breaking it out for 2015 and we're very happy with the growth in absolute dollar terms and we're seeing a pick up from customers and their usage, their increased pace of enterprise migrations, increased adoption of our services especially our machine learning services.
On your question about one-day, let me update you on that, because obviously that was a big topic of conversation last quarter and you can see that it's starting to show up in our results in Q2.
We expect to see continued ramp of the one-day selection availability for the next few quarters both in North America and international.
The initial two-day Prime shipping offer that we launched many years ago, the great expansion of our network to include FBA merchants and capacity for them and more recently, the first steps to increase one-day and same day although on a much smaller scale.
We have seen lower ASP generally in Q2, higher unit growth versus revenue growth in North America and we could be that we're mixing into some lower ASP items as we launch one-day, but we haven't drawn that total conclusion yet.
In particular on Prime Day, I think you'll see that we had -- over in the press release, we had more than $2 billion of products were bought from small and medium-sized businesses.
So, we think there's a lot of shared purpose there and a good quarter where we're looking forward to the Diwali holiday this year.
And the other thing I would point out on the trajectory is that, we're just getting started in international and most of that work is ahead of us although the speed that tick up a bit in Q1 -- excuse me Q2 but -- and will do even more so in Q3 in future quarters.
Hey Brian could you talk a little bit about the elasticity you're seeing -- you expect to see in international markets with the rollout of one-day?
But we think the biggest elasticity is probably in North America where the standard has been 2-day shipping for Prime.
I do want to add one point though because when we talk about operating income in both in Q2 and Q3 and we talk about the cost and penalty of one-day, I would like to highlight there's some other investment areas that are certainly going on here.
So yes -- sorry, the operating margin in AWS, just like the revenue rate it's such a rapidly growing business with different timing of investments and global expansion in investment in marketing and other infrastructure that is going to vary quarter-to-quarter.
But I would say that we are attributing a good bit of the revenue growth acceleration from 17% in Q1 to 20% in Q2 to the rollout of one-day and the impact of that.
If there's other things, obviously, we continue to add selection and we have again lots of engagement points of customers through Prime Benefits and video and devices that certainly contribute to our revenue run rate in our retention of Prime members.
But if we're going to point to one thing in Q1 that's different -- Q2 excuse me, that's different it was obviously the start of the -- and the step up in one-day shipments.
But my main question is just looking ahead of the holiday period given some of the moving parts and 3PL and shipping ecosystem and then of course with the transition to one-day, are you confident that there is enough capacity from your own first-party logistics as well as third-party partners to meet that seasonal demand and should we now expect a faster ramp in Amazon Air as the means to move cargo between fulfillment centers?
A lot of good work went into Prime Day, a lot of benefit for customers, a lot of benefit for our selling partners, the small business merchants as well.
We certainly have a lot of areas where we continue to invest not the least of which is our AWS business, devices, video, the global expansion of a lot of our Prime Benefits and things like stores and grocery delivery through Whole Foods, Prime Now and AmazonFresh.
Now the first part of your question, in terms of geographical mix, I mean, fair to assume that like a lot of our business, advertising in the North America segment is the bigger piece of that, but I think we're really excited about the international opportunity.

amazon,q3,2019,"Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve got a great new device lineup you may have seen announced in September and on the AWS side, weÃ¢ÂÂre looking forward to our re:Invent Conference in Las Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees.
Brian, I just wanted to ask you kind of more broadly about Prime One Day, what your biggest learnings have been so far over the past several months as youÃ¢ÂÂve been increasing availability?
So as we head into Q4, weÃ¢ÂÂve added whatÃ¢ÂÂs just nearly a $1.5 billion penalty in Q4 year-over-year for the cost of shipping, which is essentially transportation costs, the cost of expanding our transportation capacity, things like adding additional poles and shifts in our warehouses, the cost for deploying inventory closer to customers, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of tangential costs, by and a way the biggest expenses is on the actual transportation cost.
We continue to feel really good about not only the top line, but also the bottom line in that business, but we are investing a lot more this year in sales force and marketing personnel, mainly to handle a you know wider group of customers, an increasingly wide group of products, we continue to add thousands of new products and features a year, and we continue to expand geographically.
So the biggest impact that we saw in Q3 year-over-year in the AWS segment was tied to costs related to sales and marketing year-over-year and also to a secondary extent, infrastructure, which if you look at our capital leases or equipment leases line, it grew 30% on a trailing 12-month basis in Q3 of this year and that was 9% last year.
Can you just sort of talk to some of the steps, you have to take over the next one to two years to get the One Day shipping costs closer to what they used to be for Two Day, and how do you think about how long itÃ¢ÂÂs going to take?
We know we have temporary costs in the short run as we do things like forward deploy inventory, get greater inbound into those warehouses, set up new Amazon Logistics, AMZL capacity, staff you know multiple shifts, so that we can have later pull times to hit One Day cut-offs, things like that, adding sort centers.
But in the long run weÃ¢ÂÂre going to have a combination both of our own capacity, certainly fueled by helps with third party carriers, large carriers that weÃ¢ÂÂve used in the past.
But on the cost side, yes itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be the route density and other things will improve over time and get our cost structure down, but for now, there is certainly some start-up paying in adding new capacity.
In the past that pointed to investments in technology teams and thatÃ¢ÂÂs certainly part of it, but by in a way the biggest driver this time is the people that weÃ¢ÂÂre adding for fulfillment and transportation roles, especially as we head into Q4 and add this additional transportation capacity to service One Day. So Brian, IÃ¢ÂÂm wondering if you can weigh in on the puts and takes on the long-term potential margin for AWS?
And we also see a point out that you know increasingly what weÃ¢ÂÂre doing is renegotiating or negotiating incremental price decreases for customers who then commit to us long term.
So we do attribute it to One Day. So you know there has been some reduction in the threshold for some lower ASP items that weÃ¢ÂÂve been doing separately over the last six months that have spurred some sales in lower ASP items, but we think that is again the right decision for customers, especially over the long term.
But again in your question on enterprise penetration, you know I think the enterprise, weÃ¢ÂÂre making great progress there.
So I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs largely what dictates our roadmap and making sure that we give ourselves autonomy and availability to look to new areas and stay on the cusp of whether itÃ¢ÂÂs kind of emerging technologies or really just our customer needs or pain points that need to be solved.
But our focus is really on ensuring that weÃ¢ÂÂve got capacity from available resources, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs our own or our great carrier partners to be able to serve the small and medium-sized businesses in the 3P realm, but also the first party items that we are receiving orders from customers, making sure weÃ¢ÂÂre able to deliver those things quickly and reliably.
Just wondering back on the shorter holiday season, do you think thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a headwind for overall online sales in the quarter, anything specific to Amazon?
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in todayÃ¢ÂÂs press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
And can you also just help us understand how thatÃ¢ÂÂs playing into your operating income guidance for 4Q?
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Thank you for your questions Heath.
Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.

Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird.
Yeah Colin, hey itÃ¢ÂÂs Dave.
",56.83,0.8745304
amazon,q4,2019,"Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
Just on the AWS business, as you look sort of at the strength that you saw in the quarter particularly represented by the amount of dollars added quarter-over-quarter, is there anything in particular that you would call out either in terms of specific types of workloads, regions, specific customer types, that you felt like drove the strength particularly relative to the directional -- direction of growth that we were seeing in the earlier parts of the year?
I think it's been pretty broad-based, and it's kind of the culmination of a lot of work on adding new products and features, adding to our sales and marketing teams, and having better penetration in enterprise customers and hitting a lot of very different industries.
We also think that there's a real network effect when you use AWS with the millions of active customers and tens of thousands of global partners.
So, I think it's the combination of increased sales support, more and better products that hit customers' needs, and also the geographic expansion is what you're seeing.
So -- but in general, if you step away, I think what you're seeing is more and more participation of third-party sellers in our one-day delivery program as we move through the year.
So, a lot of good momentum there built up on the aggregation of benefits that we continue to add to the Prime program most recently the one-day -- expansion of one-day shipping.
I talked more in 2018 when the margins in AWS were closer to 30% about the efficiency of infrastructure spend and -- versus prior years.
But what you're seeing probably more in the margins is the expansion of our sales and marketing effort at some of those costs as well as price decreases and longer-term contracts that we've signed with some of our customers.
As far as competitive set is concerned, we -- again, we think that we have -- start with a very big lead in this space because of our many years of investment not only in capacity, but also in services and features that we provide to customers.
As you said, I think as we mentioned this in the release, we're definitely continuing to improve the experience in India for customers and sellers, excited by some of the response we've seen.
That team over there continues to do a great job locally of taking a lot of the tenants that we've had at Amazon around innovation building and really run with that over there and done a great job of coming up with some interesting and new services and features that I think are specific to that region.
Just, the first one Brian, I think on one of the media interviews, you talked about how you're becoming more efficient with one-day and you continue -- with next-day delivery and continue to do so and talked about $1 billion of cost in that current quarter.
We had talked about last year about an initial step up in cost of close to $800 million in the second quarter.
It means that there'll be a step up as we grow and expand on a volume basis and then we'll see where our rates are on actually delivering and fulfilling one day.
When we started this, again, Q2 of last year, we also had abrupt change to our fulfillment network in that, when it's tuned for two-day delivery on the most part when you move to one-day in a lot of cases, it's advantageous from a cost and transportation standpoint to have that inventory closer to the customer.
And we'll look ahead and see a step-up in that this year as we start to build more capacity for the one-day.
So, I would say that just as we've had other shocks to our warehouse system over the years from going to -- from media to almost every product you can imagine, to having a cycle of increased third-party presence in the FBA program now to one-day, we have a history here where we can look for opportunities to be more efficient and lower the -- any cost penalties as we move forward.
And then the second part would be what does that mean in terms of the way you're thinking about forward CapEx cycles for the AWS business, if you're assuming useful life is moving out maybe than prior assumptions?
The other item was Diwali timing, the Indian holiday which has a very large swing factor on international revenues is, it moved more into the third quarter this year versus -- in 2019 versus 2018.
I think we continue to see some good growth in the third-party business.
And then on transportation I think you saw the outbound shipping costs to grow around 43% year-over-year.
Q2 of last year, we started to again make larger investments, particularly in one day.
Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO; and Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in todayÃ¢ÂÂs press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
Our first question is coming from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed.
We did pledge to invest $1 billion to help digitize traders and those micro and small businesses across India.
Thanks for taking my question.
Thanks for taking the question guys.
Some other things like posts, which helps customers discover products and brands.
I think broadly with advertising, so much of this is about having -- developing great relationships with these advertisers, because I think they appreciate the fidelity we can provide around shopping outcomes.
I mean, it doesn't seem like much just given the better results and in online sales and retail third-party seller services.
The net result was a pull forward of some purchases by Japanese customers into Q3 and also some negative elasticity effects post October 1.
Our final question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.

amazon,q1,2020,"This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration of the spread of the pandemic, actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, work force staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures, our ability to continue operations in affected areas, and consumer demand and consumer spending patterns as well as the impact on suppliers creditors and third party sellers all of which are uncertain.
Many of our AWS products are helping in the government response to the crisis, and are there for customers who are seeing their own demand spikes, companies enabling video conferencing, remote learning and online health services, for example.
The first one, is the current situation is, sort of I think, in many ways sort of showcase the ability of your network to provide goods for people and the value of Prime and Amazon to customers.
Then the second one, I know there's a lot of changes going on in logistics and things, but Amazon is always a learning company.
I think they are handling the additional demand, and it gives it gives people a good time and reason to use all of their Prime benefits that maybe they hadn't used as much in the past.
And again, in what individual industries are seeing right now, things like videoconferencing, gaming, remote learning, entertainment all are seeing much higher growth and usage.
On the fulfillment efficiency, I think you were talking about one day, probably is the heart of your question, when we will get back to what we have seen and levels of one day.
And what we're seeing is, we pretty much spent about that same amount because it's - in the old days, we would have perhaps had the option to ship things two-day, three-day, four-day and seen a break on rates for the actual shipment.
We will continue to moderate our marketing in the time period when we have, again, very much the demand we are trying to fulfill is there and there's some products that are still out of stock.
And then the other thing that I would just point out is the - remember the impact of a change in the useful life of our servers, mostly hitting in the AWS business that was a $800 million benefit year-over-year in Q1.
Yes, just to add to that too, is I think about $800 million or nearly $100 million benefit in the first quarter, we do expect the change to the decrease as the year progresses some.
So it's not isolated like you can see for physical stores, but we have seen an increased demand in online grocery shopping and we have a number of ways for customers to do that.
Justin, I think the changes we've seen in the digital offerings will make people customer to those benefits and maybe advance their knowledge of what's available through - music, video, Alexa, certainly communication features on our devices.
Demand has been strong, the biggest questions we have in Q2 are more about ability to service that demand and that is the products that people are ordering in a full way, not blocking or making it hard to find non-essential items, increasing marketing, and everything else.
So, Brian, I think the third-party unit mix de-indexed a little bit as a percentage of the total this quarter.
I think there's still supply chain concerns on a lot of PPE, not only that we use, but also that we sell to customers, things like masks.
Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsavsky, our CFO, Dave Fildes, Director of Investor Relations.
Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30, 2020 only, and will include forward-looking statements.
Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC.
Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events rate of growth of the internet online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.
And with our seller community and our suppliers, what we generally have experienced getting ready for spikes in demand for known events, like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods.
Amazon Flex is supporting food banks by donating delivery services of groceries to serve 6 million meals in Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington DC, with plans to ramp this up to 25 cities across the U.S. And Alexa is helping customers access important CDC guidance, and help them evaluate their own COVID-19 risk levels.
While customer demand remains high the incremental revenue we are seeing on many of the lower ASP essential products is basically coming at cost.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.
First, I just wanted to ask, within the $4 billion of COVID related incremental costs in Q2, you talk about spending hundreds of millions on your own testing capabilities.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC.
Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.
Our backlog of future contracts continues to build, and I still think the basic value proposition of AWS that we've always pointed to, things like having the most functionality, largest vibrant community of customers and partners having really proven operational and security experience.
Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.
Our next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.
Yes. MFN is picking up a lot of the opportunity, and sellers are taking that opportunity ship direct because then it doesn't have to come into our warehouse obviously.
But I think we have a the large portion of our advertising relates to Amazon sales, not things like travel and auto which offsite which may have been disproportionately impacted at least early on here in the COVID crisis.

apple,q3,2015,"Good day everyone, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri, and after that we'll open the call to questions from analysts.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future business outlook.
We achieved these incredibly strong results despite reducing channel inventories across our product lines by over 1 million units and despite the challenging FX environment.
ChangeWave's most recent survey of US customers found that iPhone has the highest customer satisfaction rate of any smartphone brand by a wide margin, and that among iPhone owners planning to purchase a new phone, 86% plan to purchase another iPhone.
We also had a tremendous record quarter for Mac, continuing to defy the industry trend with unit growth of 9% in a market that IDC estimates contracted by 12%.
We also achieved our highest ever PC market share in the segment with Mac sales growing 33% over last year.
Market research from Wristly measured a 97% customer satisfaction rate for Apple Watch and we hear from people every day about the impact it's having on their health, their daily routines, and how they communicate.
Our own market research shows that 94% of Apple Watch owners wear and use it regularly, if not every day.
The user experience for Apple Pay and Siri is nothing short of incredible and customers are enjoying countless other features through the over 8,500 third-party apps available for Apple Watch.
We hosted a fantastic developers' conference in June with thousands of attendees from 70 countries coming together with Apple engineers to share in the excitement of our three operating systems, OS X, iOS, and watchOS.
I'd like to thank our customers, developers, business partners and employees for another record breaking quarter.
We achieved these great results in the context of a very challenging foreign exchange environment around the world and a reduction in channel inventory of over 1 million units across our product lines, which makes our growth performance even more remarkable.
Operating margin was 28.4% of revenue and net income was $10.7 billion, a new June quarter record.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.85, a 45% year-over-year increase and cash flow from operations was $15 billion, also a new third quarter record.
NPD recently indicated that iPad has 76% share of the US market for tablets priced above $200.
In the near future, United plans to introduce new apps to transform the customer experience and improve integration with flight operations.
There are now 35 apps in IBM's MobileFirst for iOS catalog that connect users to big data and analytics right on their iPads or iPhones.
In April, Apple, IBM and Japan Post announced a joint initiative to deliver iPads with IBM developed apps and analytics to connect Japanese senior citizens with services, healthcare, community and family.
Services growth was particularly strong in China, where the App Store revenue more than doubled year over year.
Thanks to our very popular Apple Store app, mobile traffic to our online stores during the quarter equaled desktop traffic for the first time ever.
We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $4 billion to repurchase 31.2 million Apple shares to open market transactions.
Revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance by $1.6 billion as we topped our internal expectations for sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch.
iPhone unit sales grew 35%, which is almost three times the rate of growth of the smartphone market overall and we gained share in all of our geographic segments.
The strong iPhone results were broad-based in both developed and emerging markets and we experienced the highest switcher rate from Android that we've ever measured.
And our ecosystem in China continues to grow at a very fast pace, with App Store revenue more than doubling in the quarter.
To prioritize those first orders and to deliver the best experience for our customers, we delayed the availability of Apple Watch in our own retail stores until mid June.
And in just the past few days, we've been able to catch up with demand, enabling us to expand Apple Watch availability to a total of 19 countries currently with three more countries to be added at the end of this month.
Our growth was driven by the tremendous performance of iPhone, the introduction of Apple Watch and the continued strength of Mac and App Store sales.
We sold 47.5 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 35% year over year growth and demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus has continued to be terrific all around the world.
We generated over $5 billion in revenue, a new all-time record, and an increase of 12% over last year thanks primarily to strong growth from apps.
The revenue from the App Store increased 24% and the number of transacting customers grew 19%, also setting an all-time record.
Our retail and online stores had a very busy quarter, with customer visits up 49% year-over-year, driven especially by the very strong interest in Apple Watch.
We ended the quarter with $202.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $9.3 billion.
In terms of what's going on with iPhone, the 35% growth is almost three times the market.
And India we grew at 93% and this is on top of the Greater China numbers that we've already covered that grew 87% during the quarter against a market of 5%.
And obviously the kind of numbers that we have indicated growth in the revenue means that iPhone would have another stellar quarter.
But as I back up from it and look at it more from a macro point of view, the things that makes me very bullish is the 27% number I just quoted, the fact that we are seeing the highest Android switcher rate, the customer satisfaction that we have on the iPhone versus the competition.
I also look at the first time iPhone buyers and we're still seeing very, very large numbers in the countries that you would want to see those in, like China and Russia and Brazil and so forth.
I also see a market that over a five-year horizon, if you look at the IDC numbers, is projected to grow from 1.3 million in 2014 to over 1.9 billion Ã¢ÂÂ this is billion, rather, billion in 2019.
And then could you give us a bit more color on the mix dynamics for the iPhone in the June quarter and how this compares to prior generations and your expectations?
And I think we talked about it in prior calls, the 6 Plus is doing particularly well in the markets that you would expect, Greater China, other Asian markets.
And then a follow-up or another question for Tim here, is that the Watch has been under a lot of interest from investors and some may have wanted a little bit more.
And to give you a little additional insight, through the end of the quarter, in fact the Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad. And we were able to do that with having only 680 points of sale.
And so I sort of back up and look at this and I feel fantastic about what the team has done and delivered and I know I never go anywhere without the Watch and it's not because I'm the CEO of Apple.
Luca, I think in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about your market share of iPad in the US above $200 being 78%.
And I'm wondering if, Tim or Luca, you could maybe talk about how you think about your market share, where you play given that your ASP is comfortably above $600?
Oh, I think there's no doubt if you look at it we are expanding the market size in those areas.
But at the aggregate level, we still remain very focused because if you look at our size versus the number of projects we have going, it's much smaller compared to most.
Nothing that's happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be Apple's largest market at some point in the future.
Somewhat going back to the China question, I mean did you see it slow down toward the end of the quarter?

apple,q4,2015,"Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Speaking first is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri, after that we'll open the call to questions from analysts.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future business outlook.
In the past 12 months around the world weÃ¢ÂÂve sold over 300 million devices including 231 million iPhones, 55 million iPads and 21 million Macs setting new unit records and increasing our global market share for both iPhone and Mac. We generated over $53 billion dollars in net income and grew earnings per share by 43%.
We returned almost $50 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while continuing to invest confidently in research and development, marketing and distribution, our retail and online stores, our supply chain and our infrastructure.
We are ending the year on a high note with a record breaking September quarter including sales of 48 million iPhones beating our expectations and up 22% year-over-year.
We exited the quarter with demand for our new iPhones exceeding supply but weÃ¢ÂÂve made good progress with our manufacturing ramp in the initial weeks of October.
We sold an all time record 5.7 million Macs continuing to defy the negative trend in the global personal computer market which IDC estimates contracted by 11%.
I personally heard from people who credit Apple Watch with saving their lives and customers are finding new applications all the time in their day to day activities.
iPad Pro will enable a new generation of apps for entertainment and productivity, design and illustration, engineering and medical and much more, and with the Apple Pencil and Smart keyboards users can customize their experience making iPad Pro an even more powerful tool for everyone from students to artists, to business professionals.
We are thrilled to bring Apple Music to China beginning this quarter along with iTunes, movies and iBooks and we are especially happy to offer such great new and diverse content to our large highly engaged and rapidly growing customer base in China.
And finally, we are making great strides in the enterprise market, announcing a new strategic partnership with Cisco in September while furthering our progress with IBM in building our mobility partners program.
Emerging markets performance was strong overall up 65% year-over-year and representing 31% of total company revenue for the quarter.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.96, a 38% year-over-year increase and cash flow from operations was $13.5 billion, also a new fourth quarter record.
We increased iPhone channel inventory by less than 2 million units in order to support our new product launch at the very end of September quarter.
Also, during the September quarter, IBM released new mobile first for iOS apps in healthcare, financial services, travel and transportation and industrial sectors, including new apps leveraging iOS 9 and Watch OS 2.
Our mobility partner program also continues to grow with more than 25 new partners added in the September quarter bringing the total to over 65 and we are already seeing some great success stories with this program.
Services growth was particularly impressive in China, where Apple App Store revenue grew by 127% year-over-year.
Revenue from other products grew strongly up 61% over last year, thanks to the growing contribution from Apple Watch.
The App Store set new all-time quarterly records for both the number of transacting customers and overall revenue.
We are thrilled to announce today that we are partnering with American Express to bring Apple Pay to eligible customers in key global markets so even more people can experience the easy, secure and private way to pay.
We estimate that enterprise markets accounted for about $25 billion in annual Apple revenue in the last 12 months, up 40% over the prior year and they represent a major growth vector for the future.
Our growth was driven by the tremendous performance of iPhone, the expanded availability of Apple Watch and all time high services revenue and Mac sales.
iPhone ASP was $670, an increase of $67 year-over-year, thanks to more favorable mix and in spite of the very significant negative impact from foreign exchange that I referred to earlier.
We generated $5.1 billion in revenue, a new all-time record, and an increase of 10% over last year mainly due to strong growth from apps.
The revenue from the App Store increased 25% and the number of transacting customers grew 18%, also setting an all-time record.
We believe that iPhone will grow in Q1 and we base that on what we are seeing from a switcher point of view, we recorded the highest rate on record for Android switches last quarter at 30%.
We also look at the number of people that have upgraded, that were in the installed base prior to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
Just as a follow-up on growth, if you look at large services companies, Facebook, Amazon, Google, they're all growing over 20% and it's largely driven by activity of Apple users on iOS devices.
I would also point out that some of these upgrade programs that are in the market, they sort of began to look more like a subscription business in terms of the way they operate.
And so we think that in the aggregate that they may reduce upgrade cycles and also the iPhone that has been sold to someone else hits the price point that we're not hitting today largely which could help further fuel the services revenue which we did quite well on last quarter.
Tim, you just briefly touched on as reducing the time between upgrades, but how do you think about the iPhone upgrade cycle compressing over the next few years, obviously the impact from carrierÃ¢ÂÂs changes in the iPhone upgrade program.
Gene, in terms of the upgrade program it's early, but here's what we believe our current view is that we do think that the broader upgrade program, so I'm not just talking about our program that in retail, I mean, that is relatively small compared to our total iPhone sales of the company, but the broader thing obviously is that many of the carriers are offering these plans.
We do like the fact that it creates a market for an iPhone at a different price point as well that is a better product than that customer maybe currently buying which would further help from an ecosystem point of view and that's not to be underestimated.
From a financial perspective, Gene, the transaction on our iPhone upgrade program is a purchase, itÃ¢ÂÂs not a lease and so we recognize our revenue upfront, of course we deduct also upfront the cost associated with the program essentially to provide interest free financing and we need to estimate deferred value of the upgrade option for the customer, but as Tim said, itÃ¢ÂÂs a popular program in our U.S store, in the scheme of things, itÃ¢ÂÂs a small percentage of our worldwide iPhone sales and so we'll have really a negligible impact for example, on ASPs for the phone.
I do think that the sort of the macro things that I spoke about earlier, the upgrade programs, the Android Switcher rate, the iPhone momentum in the emerging markets and the LTE penetration in these markets these trends are not one quarter things.
I do believe we'll grow this quarter as we put in our guidance that when you start with a number in the low 30s in terms of the percentage of the installed base thatÃ¢ÂÂs upgraded that had a phone pre the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, that number still likely to leave a lot of headroom beyond December.
And again, this is not an Apple's specific issue, Luca as you pointed out several times, but how do we think about this notion of currency hedges effectively rolling off and being replaced with hedges that are likely have less of an impact.
I think, Toni, itÃ¢ÂÂs a very good point, I mean, what's going to happen in practice is that we got this portfolio of hedge comp such that over time provides protection to our margins and to our results, but that protection diminishes as we go through the year and so we should expect that in over time during the course of fiscal 2016 that protection will come off assuming that the dollar stays at current levels.
From a product point of view, we'd actually been continuing to change and improve IOS for some time.
And can you give us some more color on China, 120% year-over-year growth in iPhones, but can you talk in general about what you're seeing in the marketplace and perhaps where you think you in terms of penetration from a smartphone standpoint especially with a China Mobile which has a substantial opportunity to grow given the LTE penetration?
If you look at China, we grew from an iPhone point of view, Greater China, we grew 87% the market grew for.
The sort of the economic question which I know there's a bit lot of attention on, frankly, if I were to shut off my web and shut off the TV and just look how many customers are coming in our stores regardless to whether they're buying, how many people are coming online, and in addition looking at our sales trend,
So, we're very bullish on it, and I would point out that we're investing in China not for next or the quarter after, or the quarter after, we're investing for the decades ahead and as we look at it our own views is that China will be Apple's top market in the world.
And then on the other side in terms of new customers, just wanted clarity on the switcher number, are you saying that 30% of iPhone shipments in the quarter went to android switchers to IOS.
When I look at the upgrade rate, Steve, what I see is I feel good that itÃ¢ÂÂs a low number because that's low number means that there is 69% of the people that are out there prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 plus that haven't bother to upgrade this year.

apple,q1,2016,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future business outlook.
Our record revenue and continued strong operating performance also led to an all-time record quarterly net income of $18.4 billion.
$100 of Apple's non-U.S. dollar revenue in Q4 of 2014 translated to only $85 last quarter due to the weakening currencies in our international markets.
Page two of our supplemental material illustrates our Q1 revenue and growth rates expressed in constant currency.
The 8% growth rate I spoke about earlier translates to $80.8 billion in constant currency revenue, which is $5 billion more than our reported revenue.
These great results were fueled by our highest ever quarterly iPhone sales and record App Store performance.
Consumers have spent billions of dollars with Apple Pay. There are now over 5 million contactless payment ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay is live today and it's soon to be accepted at thousands of Exxon and Mobil branded stations across the U.S. via their Speedpass+ app.
Finally, we also shared the incredible Apple Music experience with even more listeners, with over 10 million paying subscribers less than four months since customers began paying for the service.
For example, recent consumer surveys by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, measured an incredible 99% customer satisfaction rate for iPhone 6S and 6S Plus and an equally impressive 97% rate for the iPad Air 2.
Diluted earnings per share was $3.28, a 7% year-over-year increase over our previous all-time record and cash flow from operations was very strong, at $27.5 billion.
We continued our long running trend of PC market share gains, based on IDC's latest estimate of an 11% global market contraction, and we were especially happy with 27% year-over-year Mac sales growth in Mainland China.
We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.
IBM released 48 new IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps in the December quarter and there are now over 100 apps in the IBM MobileFirst for iOS catalog for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.
Our engineering teams are on track to deliver exciting new capabilities that create a fast lane for iOS business users by optimizing Cisco networks for iOS devices and apps, integrate iPhone with Cisco enterprise environments and provide unique collaboration opportunities on iPhone and iPad. We are also continuing to grow our mobility partner program.
One great example of our progress in the enterprise is Eli Lilly, who boosted sales productivity by equipping 15,000 field based personnel across the world with iPad. A leader in mobile technology, Lilly has eliminated laptops in the field and is upgrading its U.S. field sales teams to iPad Pro. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes stores, the average amount spent per customer reached an all-time high in the December quarter.
And I guess my follow-up question would be I know you can't talk about new products, but any high level thoughts on the virtual reality theme.
I mean can you speak to any of the points around your expectation for the smartphone market or whether you think your replacement cycle has changed or whether your ability to gain share has changed?
Luca you had talked about channel inventory increasing, it was 18.4 million for iPhone last quarter.
Speaking first today is Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri and after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.
We generated all-time record quarterly revenue of $75.9 billion in the December quarter, in line with our expectations and up 2% over last year's blockbuster results.
Major markets, including Brazil, Russia, Japan, Canada, Southeast Asia, Australia, Turkey and the eurozone, have been impacted by slowing economic growth, falling commodity prices and weakening currencies.
Last summer, while many companies were experiencing weakness in their China-based results, we were seeing just the opposite, with incredible momentum for iPhone, Mac and the App Store, in particular.
In the December quarter, despite the turbulent environment, we produced our best results ever in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% over last year, 47% sequentially, and 17% year-over-year in constant currency.
Especially during a period of economic uncertainty, we believe it is important to appreciate that a significant portion of Apple's revenue recurs over time.
So, as a result, our install base has been growing very fast and has recently reached a major milestone, crossing 1 billion active devices for the first time.
Because our install base has grown quickly, we have also seen an acceleration in the growth of our services business, another large and important source of recurring revenues.
Each quarter, we report results for our Services category, which includes revenue from iTunes, the App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and some other items.
The vast majority of the services we provide to our customers, for instance, apps, movies and TV shows, are tied to our installed base of devices, rather than to current quarter sales.
To fully comprehend the scale of the services that we are delivering to our installed base and how fast this business is growing, we look at purchases in addition to revenue.
In the recent December quarter, purchases of installed base services reached $8.9 billion, which is a growth rate of 24% year-over-year.
Our installed base services are also quite profitable, with gross margins that, on a purchase value basis, are similar to our company average.
Our growth was driven by all-time record iPhone sales, all-time record revenue from services, the expanded availability of Apple Watch, and the successful launch of the new Apple TV.
We once again achieved very impressive results in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% year-over-year and 47% sequentially to an all-time record of $18.4 billion.
Emerging markets performance was strong overall, up 11% year-over-year and representing 34% of total company revenue for the quarter.
iPhone ASP was $691 compared to $687 in the year ago quarter, in spite of a very unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
Excluding that amount, our services revenue was $5.5 billion, a new all-time record and an increase of 15% over last year, thanks in large part to strong growth from apps.
Revenue from the App Store increased 27% and the number of transacting customers grew 18%, also setting an all-time record.
Revenue from other products grew strongly, up 62% over last year, thanks to the growing contribution from Apple Watch, as well as the successful launch of the new Apple TV, both of which established new all-time quarterly records.
We expanded Apple Watch distribution significantly over the course of the quarter and we experienced especially strong results during the holiday buying season.
We are providing a wider range for revenue than usual for the second quarter because of the volatility we are seeing in the economy and in the financial and currency markets.
As you know, we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter and it's difficult for us to forecast economic and foreign exchange factors; however, at this point, we believe the March quarter faces the most difficult year-over-year compare relative to the rest of the year.
In addition to lapping, of course, a very strong year ago quarter -- just remind you that revenue growth a year ago was up 27%, there's a number of things that we're facing.
On your first question about iPhone, I think the most important thing, Gene, as you know for us, will always be the product and the experience.
But I'm wondering, and Tim, maybe you're best to answer it, if you can address what appears likely to be a decline in iPhone units and how we put that in the context of how we should think about that, given some healthy data around switchers that you highlighted.
And then we are showing that on that portion of installed base driven services business, there is a part that is related to -- where we recognize revenue in terms of the full transaction value.
To the question around the channel inventory for iPhone, we grew channel inventory by 3.3 million units during the course of the December quarter.
In terms of SG&A, we obviously seek to throttle expenditures in SG&A to the business level, with the exception of where we're investing in new stores and, for example, our expansion plans in China have not changed.
We are also continuing to invest in markets where we believe they are great places for Apple for the long-term, like India, as an example of that one.
We fortunately are strong enough to continue investing and we think it's in Apple's best long-term interest to do so.
Because we serve a significant number of customers in the Apple Store who want the iPhone when it's new and when it comes out, and so we've designed a program that made it simple and easy to do that.
Just because it seems like growing that installed base and services, as you pointed out, really economically could really help out Apple in the long-term.
",50.91,0.7924031
apple,q2,2016,"We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own expectations but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter when we saw an acceleration in iPhone upgrades and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year.
Next I'd like to talk about Services, which was our second largest revenue-generating category during the quarter.
In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter.
The reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand following a very successful launch in China in the March quarter and last week's rollout in Singapore.
In our latest survey of major markets, over half of buyers were new to the Mac. And in some countries, the percentage is extremely high, like in China, where over 80% of customers were purchasing a Mac for the first time.
For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expect its seasonality to be similar to the historical seasonality of iPod, which typically generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell-through in the December quarter.
In the June quarter, we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over two years.
As we continue through the June quarter, I'd like to remind you that we measure the health of customer demand based on sell-through.
Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range of $50.6 billion compared to $58 billion in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 13%.
It was a particularly challenging comparison to the record quarter a year ago, when iPhone sales grew 40%, as we entered last March quarter in supply/demand imbalance, which was recovered during the quarter.
iPhone ASP was $642 compared to $659 in the year-ago quarter, with weak international currencies and very popular mid-tier and entry offerings contributing to the difference year over year.
That's the highest June quarter iPhone purchase intent ever measured by the survey and five points higher than a year ago.
Turning to Services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 20% over the March quarter last year, thanks primarily to the continued strong performance of the App Store, with revenue growing 35% to a new all-time high.
Turning to iPad, we sold 10.3 million units compared to 12.6 million units in the year-ago quarter.
In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we expect to return $87 billion to our investors, which represents about 15% of our market cap at the current stock price.
Sequentially, our guidance implies a revenue decline of 15% to 19%, which is comparable to the 17% sequential decline that we've averaged from the March to June quarter for the last three years, despite the anticipated channel inventory adjustments I just described.
We believe the difference comes primarily from three areas: first, the $2 billion-plus channel inventory reduction I just mentioned; second, the effect of the channel inventory reduction and the launch of iPhone SE on iPhone ASPs, as well as the current constrained supply of iPhone SE; and third, different estimates for Mac, which we expect to grow sequentially at a rate similar to what we have experienced in the past June quarters.
And then the bigger question, Tim, was with the smartphone market now reaching a pretty mature growth phase, how does Apple think of itself going forward?
And also this channel inventory reduction that we've talked about, obviously the channel inventory reduction will come from higher-end models, and that is also affecting the sequential trend on ASPs. The question on Services, when we look at our Services business, it's obviously growing very well across the board.
We have an iCloud business that is growing very quickly, faster than the App Store from a much lower base, but I think it's important for us as we continue to develop these businesses.
It doesn't provide a meaningful financial contribution at this point, but as we look at the amount of transactions that are going through Apple Pay right now and we think ahead for the long term, that could be an interesting business for us as well.
From a profitability standpoint, we had mentioned last time that when you look at it on a gross basis, so in terms of purchase value of these services, the profitability of the business is similar to company average.
Obviously, what is different and particularly as we look at it on a sequential basis coming out of the March quarter, we will have lots of leverage, and that obviously is going to have a negative impact on margins.
And particularly when you look at iPhone, what I was mentioning to Gene earlier, I think we've got a couple of things that are affecting not only ASPs, but obviously they also affect margins.
Okay, thank you, and then a question for Tim. I appreciate the optimism around longer-term iPhone unit growth, but with developed market penetration in the Ã¢ÂÂ anywhere from 60% to 80%, the growth is going to have to come from new markets.
But I view India as where China was maybe seven to ten years ago from that point of view, and I think there's a really great opportunity there.
I guess the question is, given that you should be entering new markets and you should see pronounced elasticity from the iPhone SE device, why wouldn't we be seeing something that was dramatically above normal seasonal in terms of iPhone revenues and units for this quarter?
Maybe you could push back on me, but I can't help thinking that when Apple introduced the iPad mini in a similar move to move down-market, there was great growth for one quarter, and the iPad never grew again, and margins and ASPs went down.
The channel inventory reduction that Luca referred to, the vast, vast majority of that is in iPhone, and so that would affect the unit compare that you may be thinking about.
And as I had said in my remarks, we believe we're going to have the best compare for iPad revenue this quarter that we have had in quite some time.
But I think iPhone has a particularly different kind of cycle to it than the tablet market.
Now the good news is Ã¢ÂÂ the great news from my point of view is I think we're strategically positioned very well because we've announced the iPhone SE.
But just if you could, talk about some of the trends you're seeing there and how you think it's playing out, and maybe your thoughts on iPhone SE adoption within China as well.
We do much more in-house technology development than we used to do a few years ago, which we think is a great investment for us to make.
Speaking first is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for capital return and debt issuance.
And third, with only 42% smartphone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first-time smartphone buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets.
App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all-time record.
And Apple Music continues to grow in popularity, with over 13 million paying subscribers today.
We feel really great about the early success of Apple's first subscription business, and our Music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline.
The Services business is powered by our huge installed base of active devices, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year.
Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than five times the transaction volume of a year ago and 1 million new users per week.
Creating value for shareholders by developing great products and services that enrich people's lives will always be our top priority and the key factor driving our investment and capital allocation decisions.
As our business continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, we are in the fortunate position to expand our capital return program again this year, as we have done each year since we started the program four years ago.
Gross margin was 39.4%, near the high end of our guidance range, thanks to strong cost performance.
Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes Store's, the average amount spent per customer reached a new all-time record in the March quarter.
Revenue from other products grew 30% over last year thanks to Apple Watch.
We returned $10 billion to investors during the quarter, including $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $7 billion on repurchases of 71.8 million Apple shares through open market transactions.
The revenue guidance implies a year-over-year decline as we lap an incredibly strong June quarter last year where revenue grew 33%, due in part to accelerated iPhone upgrade purchases.
This tough compare is compounded by the continued weak macro environment this year and the strong U.S. dollar, which affects our revenue growth in international markets.
Tim has talked about Apple Pay. We don't get into the specifics of specific products or services, but it's very clear it's significantly higher than company average.
If you look at our installed base of iPhone today versus two years ago, it's increased by 80%.
",50.6,0.8875405
apple,q3,2016,"Our initial sales data tells us that the iPhone SE is popular in both developed and emerging markets, and the percentage of iPhone SE sales going to customers who are new to iPhone is greater than we've seen in the first weeks of availability for other iPhones launched in the last several years.
Overall, we added millions of first-time smartphone buyers in the June quarter, and switchers accounted for the highest percentage of quarterly iPhone sales we've ever measured.
The growth was broad-based, with App Store revenue up 37% to a new all-time high, in addition to strong increases in Music, iCloud, and AppleCare.
We had our best iPad compare in 10 quarters, with revenue growing 7% thanks to the rollout of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. We're proud to have the most exciting lineup of tablets and accessories in the world and exceptionally high customer satisfaction and engagement.
Switchers and first-time smartphone buyers represented the lion's share of our iPhone sales in the quarter, and our installed base of iPhones in China has grown by 34% over the last year alone.
Customers can look forward to more expressive ways to communicate with messages now with its own App Store, allowing users to create and share content, make payments, add stickers and more, all without leaving messages, which is now one of the largest messaging services in the world.
Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. Revenue for the June quarter was $42.4 billion, near the high end of our guidance range, compared to $49.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.
On a geographic basis, our revenue grew strongly in Japan to a new June quarter record, and we experienced healthy growth in a number of other important markets, including Russia, Brazil, Turkey, India, and Canada.
Turning to Services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 19% over the June quarter last year.
Because of this continued growth, for the first nine months of our fiscal year, Services increased from 8% of our total revenue a year ago to 11% this year, and it represents an even higher percentage of our profitability.
Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. In addition to the overall market slowdown, we faced a very difficult compare to the year-ago quarter, when we introduced a new MacBook Pro and a new iMac. Despite these challenges, Mac continues to gain a high percentage of new customers, and our Mac installed base has grown to a new all-time high at the end of the June quarter.
As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Luca.
How are you thinking about commodity pricing and mix of the new products and that just as you look to how you guided gross margin?
On the positive side, we're going to have leverage because we are guiding to a sequential increase in revenue, and we expect to have positive mix as we get into the September quarter, and these positives being offset more or less by what we call product transition costs, which are typical at this time of the year for us.
We think that the best experience for users include apps, and so we want to do everything that we can do to continue building that.
But there's an added factor this time around, which is you don't have the 4 million units of high-ASP, high-margin inventory drain in September like you did in the June quarter.
And, Tim, can you speak to how you envision the upgrade rate of the iPhone installed base to play out over the next quarter or the next year?
Starting with your comments on the June quarter, I just want to point out that when we talk about a $3.6 billion channel inventory reduction, that is not entirely related to iPhone.
On the September quarter, when I look at the sequential increase for iPhone units that we are expecting, I would say that it is, even with the sell-through adjustments that you've talked about, it's still pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past.
So I guess my question is, you have a mechanism, which is the Apple Upgrade Program, which takes replacement cycle out of the equation and puts people on buying the phone as a service.
And then just more broadly, is Apple thinking about ways to sell not only the iPhone, but more of its products on a monthly type subscription basis, perhaps in a more bundled fashion so that you can add more predictability to what is now largely a transactional revenue model?
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. The iPhone demand is made up, as you know, of upgraders, switchers and new to smartphone.
And we think that from a user point of view, as the smartphone itself becomes more and more essential to people's daily lives, which is a part of what I had talked about before, a part of bringing it into the home in a bigger way and in the car and at work and so forth, we think people will put more and more focus on what they're buying and the thing that Apple does best, which is provide this killer experience.
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I notice there are people that want to call it a new computer platform, and we'll see.
Luca, I just want to clarify that last point on ASPs on iPhone because last quarter it seemed that you were quite clear that that was a negative driver to the gross margin of the company.
How do you think about that as an actual business opportunity as opposed to here's an Apple box and we sell some units, but it's not that meaningful to the overall company in terms of size?
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thank you for the question.
Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple, Incorporated third quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings release conference call.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook.
Today we're pleased to report third quarter results that reflect stronger customer demand and business performance than we anticipated just 90 days ago and include several encouraging signs.
We saw tremendous performance from our Services businesses, which grew 19% to a June quarter record of $6 billion.
Most of our terrific Services performance during the quarter was fueled by our active installed base of devices, with installed base-related purchases of $10.3 billion accelerating to 29% growth year on year.
With watchOS 3 coming this fall, customers will be able to update their Apple Watches with an enhanced user interface, significantly improved performance and all-new fitness and health capabilities, including activity sharing.
We opened our 41st Greater China retail store during the quarter, and we also made a $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing.
According to China Mobile, there are more iPhones on their network than any other brand, with iPhone users ranking first in terms of customer loyalty, data usage and ARPU.
By far, the largest portion of our global channel inventory reduction was in Greater China, so our underlying business there is stronger than our results imply.
In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our total revenue from Greater China was almost $40 billion, up 55% from the same timeframe just two years ago, while iPhone units were up 47%.
This fall we'll also bring Apple Pay to Safari so users can easily make secure and private purchases when shopping on participating websites.
Tens of millions of users around the world are enjoying Apple Pay today at stores and in app, with estimated monthly active users up more than 450% year on year last month.
A recent survey by 451 Research found that among U.S. corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPhones.
This is the highest corporate purchase intent ever measured by the survey for the September quarter.
Corporate buyers report a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 71% for the September quarter.
We spent $4 billion on repurchases of 41.2 million Apple shares through open-market transactions.
You mentioned that 451 Research is finding business interest in phones, but their survey on consumers actually finds the lowest level of expectation for purchases in the next three months since 2008.
I was wondering if I could direct one at Tim. And my belief is that one of the bigger longer-term concerns for Apple is that the replacement cycle could just structurally elongate over time, particularly as your installed base of customers becomes less affluent and more international.
Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. So can you just give us your perspective on the market, your expectations around getting those services back up, and also regaining share?
Is this a business that ultimately impacts the Services line in any measurable way, or is Apple Pay generally about selling iPhones?
So the combination of these two things obviously had an impact on ASPs. But I think as I said or Tim said during the prepared remarks, we do expect iPhone ASP to improve sequentially as we move into the September quarter because these two factors that I just mentioned are not going to repeat.
",62.01,0.7684221
apple,q4,2016,"We sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters, as we forecasted in January.
In fact, J.D. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments where they commute, dine and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong growth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next few months.
We expect over 100 HomeKit-compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple to help ensure customer security when using them.
Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity.
Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone.
We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and continued strong demand for other iPhones.
iPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to iPhone 7 and 7 Plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than our September quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.
We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a level similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.
Turning to Services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago.
As we move ahead into the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
This represents a return to growth over the all-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago.
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. In terms of iPhone 7, Gene, the carriers that had upgrade plans, the information that we have from them is that demand is very robust.
Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Let me say a few things on the 14th week and revenue up for the December quarter.
We think we can continue to grow very well into the December quarter.
As you know, the launch timing of the new iPhone is different this year.
As Tim said, we are very supply constrained on iPhone 7 Plus this year.
And then keep in mind that there were a couple of things that affect the compare as well, which is the fact that a year ago, we had an award for a patent infringement of $548 million, which is obviously a one-off item that is not going to repeat this year.
A follow up for Tim. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. There's clearly some amount of R&D that are on products that today are in the development phase that have not reached the market, and so that's a part of it.
There's lots of reasons, but the largest one in our view is that when you look at what happened in 2015 in China, we had a surge of upgraders that came into the market for the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, and the upgrade rate increased relatively more in Greater China than elsewhere around the world.
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. And I don't mean like the smaller ones that you've done sort of at a normal cadence, but there was clearly a fairly large one announced at least this week in the content world.
And I appreciate some of the issues around channel inventory build and the timing of the launch, but if I just stand back from that and say you have terrific new products, your major competitor's laying down, you have an enormous, you have a significant contribution from an extra week, arguably 7% or 8%, and yet the iPhone growth is sort of flattish, what does that really say about how investors should think about iPhone on a sustained basis growing forward?
I think you mentioned a number of the things that are affecting us in the December quarter, and I went through them with Katy just a few minutes ago.
And so when we look at all these things in its totality, we think that for the total company of course, we believe that revenue's going to grow.
You know that we don't get into specific product from a unit standpoint giving guidance, and so we feel very confident about the trajectory for the company and for iPhone going forward.
Tim mentioned Apple Music, but we got other parts of the business that continue to do well, even as I said during a period of time when our sales have come down a bit.
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I think to answer your second question first, I think that most people would like an assistant with them all the time.
Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. If I can add, Wamsi, keep in mind that in a lot of countries around the world, the reality is that our customers have seen some significant price increases because of the FX situation, right.
But I suspect that any time there are large numbers of customers that have a phone that's in that two year kind of range that it tends to be a sweet spot, and I think you probably will see a lot of people trying to recruit those customers.
And then, Tim, for the clarification questions, is it fair to say that the OpEx has a disproportionate more expense side with the 14th week that we should kind of think of maybe as we go forward, that we shouldn't expect the OpEx to kind of be chugging along at that high rate?
Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Jim. Can we have the next question, please?
And I think over the years, we made very good trade-offs and our gross margins have been quite stable over time.
Good day everyone and welcome to this Apple, Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook.
Power recently announced that Apple Music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.
We're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smartwatch, packed with new features including built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display and a powerful dual-core processor.
One recent example is Aetna, which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch for individual customers and select large employers.
We've just rolled out new versions of iOS, macOS and watchOS and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac, enhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call memories.
We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all new App Store for Messages, and there has been a marked increase in our monthly active users.
Our Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home.
With our latest operating systems, machine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive and even more personal.
Machine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products.
We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening it to developers and most recently by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra.
As we close the books on another incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our amazing developer community for their relentless creativity and our wonderful customers, business partners and shareholders for their loyalty and support.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.67 and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion, which is a new record for the September quarter.
In the U.S. for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found that among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting a 97% customer satisfaction rating.
In addition to the great performance from apps, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically, as Tim mentioned.
Thanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing the total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a full-year lifecycle.
I wouldn't say yes at this point, because the underlying demand looks extremely strong on both products but particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus versus our forecast going into the product launch.
Keep in mind that December quarter a year ago for us was an all-time quarterly revenue record.
You know that we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago.
I know you can't tell us what your intentions are here, but if you could help us understand how that thinking around the dividend works, it would be great.

apple,q1,2017,"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated first quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings release conference call.
Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today.
The strong performance of our business also produced all-time record earnings per share.
iPhone had a tremendous quarter thanks to exceptional demand that beat our own internal expectations.
App Store customers broke all-time records during the holiday quarter, including $3 billion in purchases in December alone, making it the App Store's single best month ever.
And beginning this quarter, Comcast customers can pay their monthly bill in a single touch with Apple Pay. Our Services offerings are now driving over 150 million paid customer subscriptions.
We were supply constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the December quarter and are just now coming into supply/demand balance.
This level of home automation was unimaginable just a few years ago, and it's here today with iOS and HomeKit. We're making great progress in the enterprise market alongside our major partners.
Total Greater China segment revenue was down 12%, but revenue from Mainland China was even with the all-time record results from a year ago and grew in constant currency terms.
Third, the stronger U.S. dollar affected total revenue growth this year by 100 basis points.
Also, strong customer interest left us in supply/demand imbalance for several of our products throughout the quarter this year.
Diluted earnings per share were $3.36, a new all-time record, and cash flow from operations was $27.1 billion.
Customer demand was even higher than our reported results, as iPhone unit sell-through was up 8%.
Despite stronger demand than last year, we added only 1.2 million units of iPhone channel inventory across the quarter, significantly less than the increase of 3.3 million units a year ago.
We also reduced channel inventory by about 700,000 units as opposed to an increase of 900,000 units last year, and we exited the quarter near the low end of our five to seven-week target range.
We are continually updating our stores and adding new and exciting outreach programs to educate kids on our products, entertain the community with fresh live music, teach future Swift developers to code, and empower entrepreneurs to start, grow, and evolve their businesses.
We returned almost $15 billion to investors during a very busy December quarter for our capital return activities.
We spent $5 billion on repurchases of 44.3 million Apple shares through open market transactions.
And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in an initial delivery and retirement of 44.8 million shares.
So I think it would be helpful to just get an update on your views around potentially larger M&A and some of the areas of interest that you've noted in the past like owning more original content to penetrate more of the TV opportunity that the company has long talked about addressing.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook.
Revenue from our music business grew for the third quarter in a row, and our AppleCare and iPlus storage services had all-time record results.
Apple Pay continued its strong momentum, with the number of users more than tripling over the past year and hundreds of millions of transactions and billions of dollars in purchases in the December quarter alone.
It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, both units and revenues, with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough.
As we reflect on a record-breaking December quarter, I'd like to thank our developers, our business partners, and our employees for their incredible contributions and commitment.
Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. Revenue for the December quarter was $78.4 billion, the highest quarterly revenue in the history of Apple and above our guidance range.
As Tim mentioned, the strength of our results was very broad-based, as we set new revenue records for iPhone, for Services, for Mac, and for Apple Watch.
We also established new all-time revenue records in most developed and emerging markets, with strong growth rates in many countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada, France, Australia, Brazil, India, Turkey, and Russia.
We had a terrific quarter for iPhone as we sold 78.3 million units, a new all-time record and an increase of 5% over last year.
Turning to Services, we generated an all-time record $7.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year over year.
Next I would like to talk about the Mac. We were very happy to report double-digit unit growth in several countries, including Japan, Mainland China, India, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as well as in the U.S. education market.
And we posted double-digit growth in both Mainland China and India, as we've expanded distribution channels in those countries and we continue to attract a very high percentage of first-time tablet buyers.
And in November, 451 Research measured a 94% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Mini, a 97% rate for iPad Air, and 96% for iPad Pro. Our retail stores experienced strong double-digit growth in visitors and revenue in the December quarter.
And as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.
You know that the dollar has appreciated significantly toward the end of the December quarter, and so we've got 80 basis points of sequential headwind from foreign exchange.
The way that we participate in the changes that are going on in the media industry that I fully expect to accelerate from the cable bundle beginning to break down is, one, we started the new Apple TV a year ago, and we're pleased with how that platform has come along.
If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12%, and about 4 points of that was currency related, so it's an 8 point decline in constant currency.
And then within Greater China, if you look at the PRC, our revenue was flat year over year, and that was against the all-time record quarter.
iPad units were also up double digit in Mainland China, which was obviously different than the trend that we saw in the balance of the world.
And obviously, our total installed base continues to grow there in the strong double digits.
And what I'm trying to figure out is I think the number was you're going to be doubling within the next four years, at least that's your expectation.
So we are seeing significant growth not only in the developed markets, where you expect to see a lot of transaction volume, but we see great growth in places like China, for example.
And so as we look, as I was explaining earlier, as we look at the number of people that transact growing double digits, we see the amount spent per paid account growing so well, we think that the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth.
A lot of it comes from the fact that our install base of devices around the world continues to grow very well, strong double digits.
I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the iPhone upside in the quarter with record revenues in every region except for Greater China.
Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. I think it's a good question, a number of points that I want to make.
Starting with the growth in the install base of iPhones, yes, it's growing strong double digits, and that's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's a big driver for our Services business.

apple,q2,2017,"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for capital return and debt issuance.
Today we are reporting strong March quarter results, with accelerating revenue growth and earnings per share up 10% over last year.
Global revenue was up 5% year on year, with growth accelerating from our December quarter performance.
App Store momentum is terrific, with revenue growing 40% year over year to an all-time quarterly record.
We also saw double-digit revenue growth from Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage and overall very strong growth in the total number of paid subscriptions for our own services and the third-party content we offer on our stores.
Revenue grew 14% to a new March quarter record and gained market share thanks to strong demand for our new MacBook Pros.
We also updated our most popular sized iPad with a brighter Retina display and best-in-class performance at its most affordable price ever, and customer response to date has been very strong.
We set a new March quarter record for India, where revenue grew by strong double digits.
Apple Retail is entering an exciting chapter with new experiences for customers and breathtaking new store designs.
The new Apple Dubai Mall is a truly international store, with employees who collectively speak 45 languages, and are already welcoming customers from around the world.
Diluted earnings per share were $2.10, an increase of 10% over last year, and cash flow from operations was strong at $12.5 billion.
Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong, not only with consumers but also with business users.
In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 96% customer satisfaction rating among iPhone 7 owners and 98% for iPhone 7 Plus.
The App Store established a new all-time revenue record and grew 40% year over year.
We continue to see growth in average revenue per paying account as well as the number of paying accounts across our content stores during the quarter.
Revenue was up 14% year over year and set a new March quarter record.
And Capital One has reimagined the customer banking experience by empowering their associates with Mac and Apple Watch and over 40 native iOS applications now running on nearly 30,000 iPhones and iPads.
Our retail and online stores produced great results, with strong revenue growth in all our geographic segments and 18% growth overall.
We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and we spent $4 billion on repurchases of 31.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions.
And we've also at the same time I think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain key technologies, let's call them, that maybe you want to penetrate the market with.
Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you very much and congratulations on returning to growth consistently.
Do you think that say this next 12 Ã¢ÂÂ 18 months is going be a turning point, or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple-owned stores or production there?
That's despite a $1 billion year-over-year revenue headwind from foreign exchange in the March quarter and a larger iPhone channel inventory reduction this year versus last year.
iPad results were ahead of our expectations, and we believe we gained share during the March quarter in a number of major markets, including the U.S., Japan, and Australia.
In fact, when we combine Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones, our revenue from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company.
In Greater China, we were very pleased to see strong double-digit revenue growth from both Mac and Services during the March quarter.
Revenue for the March quarter was $52.9 billion, and we achieved double-digit growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, Russia and Mexico.
We sold 50.8 million iPhones, and we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.2 million units in the quarter, compared to a reduction of about 450,000 a year ago.
iPhone ASP was $655, up from $642 a year ago, thanks to a strong mix of iPhone 7 Plus and in spite of unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
Turning to Services, we generated $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year over year and our best results ever for a 13-week quarter.
We're very happy with the strong level of growth, especially given the tough compare to last year, as the busy week between Christmas and New Year's fell within the March fiscal quarter a year ago but was included in the December fiscal quarter this year.
And according to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating twice the revenue of Google Play during the March quarter.
We set a new enterprise revenue record for the March quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue for the remainder of the year.
As Tim mentioned, today we're announcing an update to our program, which we are extending by four quarters through March of 2019, and increasing in size to a total of $300 billion.
In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we expect to return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12% of our market cap at the current stock price.
Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Luca, and we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up.
Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Katy, a lot of questions.
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon.
So this very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores, and that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits.
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Rod. Could we have the next question, please?
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks for the question.
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks for the question.
And so I think that when you do that, you're going to find that actually the year-over-year performance is similar between the quarters.
Last year, you had a 4 million-unit channel inventory reduction for the iPhone in the June quarter.
And if you look at our history over the last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory in the June quarter, so I think it's a fair expectation to have.
",57.81,0.9068279
apple,q3,2017,"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook.
Services revenue hit an all-time quarterly record of $7.3 billion, representing 22% growth over last year.
We achieved our highest global market share in over four years based on IDC's latest estimate of tablet market results for the June quarter.
And for high school and community college students who want to pursue careers in the fast-growing app economy, we announced app development with Swift, an innovative full-year curriculum designed by Apple engineers and educators and provided free to schools to teach students to code and design fully functional apps, gaining critical job skills in software development and information technology.
I'd like to turn now to Mac, which gained global unit market share and reached new June quarter unit sales records in mainland China and Japan.
Mac revenue grew 7% year over year, driven by the strength of the MacBook Pro and iMac despite IDC's latest estimate of a 4% unit contraction in the global PC market.
We've earmarked at least $1 billion for this program, aimed at helping our manufacturing partners develop innovative production capabilities and create high-skill jobs in the United States.
With deep knowledge of music, HomePod is designed to work with your Apple Music subscription to help you enjoy the music you already love as well as to discover great new music, based on your personal preferences.
Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong with both consumers and business uses.
In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 95% customer satisfaction rating for iPhone 7 and 99% for iPhone 7 Plus.
Momentum is strongest in international markets, where the infrastructure for mobile payments has developed faster than in the U.S. Thanks to great performance from the new MacBook Pro, we generated 7% revenue growth over last year and gained share in the global PC market based on the latest data from IDC.
Customer satisfaction for Mac is very strong at 97% in the most recent survey from 451 Research, and our active installed base of Mac has grown double digits over a year ago.
In addition, the most recent survey from 451 Research measured business and consumer satisfaction rates ranging from 95% to 99% across iPad models.
Initial response from businesses to iOS 11 and the new iPad Pro has been amazing.
As Tim mentioned last quarter, we have entered a new chapter in retail with unique and rewarding experiences for our customers and some stunning new stores coming in the near future.
So appreciating you only formally guide a quarter out, I wonder if there's any qualitative commentary you can provide to help us think about the back half of this calendar year and how all those new products that come into the model could impact either revenue seasonality versus past years or could impact just the costs associated with ramping that many products all at once.
They've done a great job of implementing a lot of iOS features in their apps and we're looking forward to working with them even more to build even greater experiences for our mutual users in China.
Thank you, a question for Tim maybe on the iPhone install base.
So as we look forward maybe three to four years, do you think Apple can expand its unit market share?
Today we're proud to announce very strong results for our fiscal third quarter, with unit and revenue growth in all of our product categories.
We had very positive results for iPad, with broad-based growth in units, revenue, and market share.
And in markets like China and Japan, over half of iPads sold were to people buying their very first iPad. The new iPad we launched in March offers great value and performance.
iPad is the perfect tool for teaching in new and compelling ways, and our iPad results were especially strong in the U.S. education market, where sales were up 32% year over year to over 1 million units.
Sales of Apple Watch were up over 50% in the June quarter, and it's the number one selling smartwatch in the world by a very wide margin.
Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone.
Revenue for the June quarter was $45.4 billion, up 7% over last year, an acceleration to the growth rate we reported during the first half of our fiscal year.
We achieved double-digit revenue growth in many developed markets, including the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, Australia, and Korea, and emerging markets outside of Greater China grew 19% over a year ago.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory, and we have a great lineup of Macs for our customers heading into the busy back-to-school season.
We were happy to see iPad growth in each of our geographic segments, with strong double-digit increases in key markets such as the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, and Greater China.
Our enterprise business continues to expand, and our customers are transforming the way work gets done with iOS and iPad. Just last month, we unveiled the next set of technology announcements in our partnership with Cisco.
Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Luca, and we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up.
Luca, first question for you, gross margin guidance is strong, but it did tick down from your June quarter guidance, and you also narrowed the range to 50 basis points.
In terms of WeChat, the way that I look at this is because our share Ã¢ÂÂ because iOS share is not nearly a majority of the market in China, the fact that a lot of people use that, it makes the switching opportunity even greater.
Starting with the U.S., let me just take this question from what are we doing to increase jobs, which I think is probably where it's rooted.
And I think this area in general and all the things we do for the developer community will be the largest contribution that Apple can make because this is the fastest growing job segment in the country, and I think will be for quite some time.
I think there are probably several plants that can benefit from having some investment to grow or expand or even maybe set up shop in the U.S. for the first time, so we're very excited about that.
The central government in China back in 2015 started tightening the regulations associated with VPN apps, and we have a number of those on our store.
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I think the upgrade rate is a function of many, many different things, from the size of the installed base, the age of the installed base, the product that is new at the time, the regional distribution, the upgrade plans that are in various markets around the world.
But I think in general, because our installed base was up strong double digit once again, there's a lot of factors that are very positive for us.
Luca, typically in the fiscal Q4, Apple builds considerable iPhone channel inventory, like 2 million or 3 million units.
And basically, how does this come to market in the most significant way in the next few quarters as Apple becomes the largest global platform for AR as you've talked about?
I guess to start off with, on your Services segment, revenues actually I think accelerated by 400 basis points to worse than what you guys had in the first half of this year.
On a year-over-year basis, the number of accounts that are actually transacting and paying on the App Store is growing very, very well.
We have other businesses like the Apple Music streaming service, which is growing very fast because we just started it a couple of years ago, so we are getting a lot of new subscribers there.
I know iPhone grew about 2% year over year this quarter, and it looks like you had about a mid-teens market share in units in 2016.
I do think that we can grow both in units and market share.
",62.01,0.89465314
apple,q4,2017,"As we expected, we returned to growth in greater China, with unit growth and market share gains for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. In fact, it was an all-time record quarter for Mac sales in mainland China as well as an all-time high for Services revenue.
And revenue from emerging markets outside of greater China was up 40%, with great momentum in India, where revenue doubled year over year.
Gross margin for the September quarter was at the high end of our guidance range, and thanks to exceptional work by our teams, we generated record fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.07, up 24% from a year ago.
A few quarters ago, we established a goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue of $24 billion by the year 2020, and we are well on our way to meeting that goal.
And with the launch of iOS 11, the iPad experience has become more powerful than ever, with great new features for getting things done like the new dock, Files app, drag and drop, multitasking and more power than most PC notebooks.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac, which had its best year ever, with the highest annual Mac revenue in Apple's history.
It was also the best September quarter ever, with Mac revenue growth of 25% driven by the notebook refreshes we launched in June and a strong back-to-school season.
This is the first store that brings together our complete vision for the future of Apple retail, providing a welcoming place for everyone to experience our products, services and inspiring educational programs right in the heart of their city.
Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. Revenue for the September quarter was a record $52.6 billion, up 12% over last year, and it has been great to see our growth rate accelerate in every quarter of fiscal 2017.
We were very pleased to see double digit iPhone growth in many emerging markets including mainland China, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India and Mexico.
iPhone channel inventory increased by 1.3 million units sequentially to support the launch of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, significantly less than the increase in the September quarter a year ago.
The App Store set a new all-time record, and according to App Annie's latest report, it continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases by a wide and growing margin, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play.
The success of Apple Music also continues to build and we're seeing our highest conversion rates from customers trying the service.
Next, I would like to talk about the Mac, which for fiscal 2017 set a new all-time revenue record of $25.8 billion.
It was great to see iPad unit and revenue growth in all of our geographic segments and particularly strong results in emerging markets, including greater China, where iPad units sales were up 25% year-over-year and India, which grew 39%.
NPD indicates that iPad had 54% share of the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter, including seven of the 10 best-selling tablets.
Beyond our iOS devices, we are also seeing great traction for Mac in the enterprise market with all-time record customer purchases in fiscal year 2017.
Retail ran a very successful back-to-school promotion in the Americas, Europe, China and Singapore, with sales of Mac and iPad Pro up strong double digits compared to last year's program.
We increased market share for iPhone, Mac and iPad during the quarter.
We hit all-time revenue records for Services and for Mac for the PRC during the quarter.
We had double digit unit growth in iPhone and both the upgraders and Android switchers were both up on a year over year basis during the quarter, and so the results were broad based.
We don't obviously provide geographic-specific guidance but you can see from our overall guidance, we think we're going to have a really strong quarter.
Cook - Apple, Inc. In terms of what we saw in Q4, you can probably tell from the ASP we had good success, I would say, through the different iPhones.
And this is the first time we've ever been in the position that we've had three new iPhones at once like this at the top end of the line.
But in terms of price elasticity, I think it's important to remember that a large number of people pay for the phone by month.
And iPhone X has a lot of great new technologies in there that are leading the industry, and it is a fabulous product and we can't wait for people to start getting it in their hands.
Just following up a little bit on that question, Tim. And I think given the uniqueness of the product you have with the iPhone X in particular, that makes a lot of sense.
Also, the mix of products that we sell into the market tends to change over time, and that also has an impact on the overall gross margin for the company.
When we look at our track record over years, I think we've found a good balance between unit grow and gross margins and revenue, and we will continue to do that as we go forward.
As I mentioned, I think to Toni, we have higher cost structures every time we launch new products.
And so we just had a phenomenal quarter on iPad, on the Mac, on Services, on Apple Watch, on iPhone.
Good day everyone and welcome to this Apple Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call.
Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future business outlook.
We generated revenue growth across all of our product categories and showed all-time record results for our Services business.
We also had great results in enterprise and education with double digit growth in worldwide customer purchases of iPad and Mac in both markets.
iPhone X is packed with innovative new technologies that chart our path for the next decade, technologies like the TrueDepth camera system, Super Retina Display, and A11 Bionic chip with neural engine, which has been in development for years with a focus on deep machine learning.
There are already over 1,000 apps with powerful AR features in our App Store today, with developers creating amazing new experiences in virtually every category of apps aimed at consumers, students and business users alike.
So now users around the world can watch movies and shows in 4K HDR quality and stream live sports and news on the Apple TV app.
Community colleges have a powerful reach into communities where education is the great equalizer, and the colleges adopting our curriculum this academic year are providing opportunity to millions of students to build apps that will prepare them for careers in software development and information technology and much more.
Diluted earnings per share were $2.07, up 24% over last year to a new September quarter record and cash flow from operations was strong at $15.7 billion.
Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong with both consumers and business users.
We also saw great performance from our iCloud business with very strong double-digit growth in both monthly average users and revenue.
We sold 5.4 million Macs during the September quarter, up 10% over last year and gained significant market share as the global market contracted by 1% based on IDC's latest estimate.
This performance was fueled primarily by great demand for MacBook Pro and Mac revenue grew 25% to a new September quarter record.
It was also another great quarter for iPad. We sold 10.3 million units, up 11% over last year with strong demand for both iPad and iPad Pro and revenue grew 14%.
Experts from Apple are co-locating with this team and together they'll be launching new tools and services that help enterprise clients transform how they engage with customers using iPhone and iPad. Examples include services to build new customer experiences and to facilitate iOS integration with enterprise systems to help businesses take greater advantage of data from Internet of Things platforms and to enable the smooth transfer of existing legacy applications and data to modern iOS apps.
GE is also standardizing on iPhone and iPad for its global workforce of more than 330,000 employees and working with Apple, GE is developing iOS apps for both its internal and external audiences to bring predictive data and analytics to workers across a broad range of industries.
You've talked historically about that region being more sensitive than others to form factor changes and the new iPhone X form factor was not available in September.
Yes. And then we've got three new iPhones and people will look at these and decide which one they want.
I would highlight maybe three of these businesses within Services at the App Store set a new all-time record.

Apple's active installed base reached 1.3 billion devices in January and is at an all-time high for all of our major products.
We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings.
Our teams carried out an extremely complex launch from both an engineering and operations perspective, executing an outstanding product ramp that required years of research and development; one that introduced innovative features like an edge-to-edge Super Retina Display and the TrueDepth Camera, which enables Face ID.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre seeing great excitement around augmented reality with customers now enjoying over 2,000 ARKit enabled app, spanning every category in the App Store.
Apple Pay has reached an important milestone in the U.S. As a result of 50% year-over-year growth in merchant adoption, itÃ¢ÂÂs now accepted at more than half of all American retail locations, which includes more than two-thirds of the countryÃ¢ÂÂs top 100 retailers.
Now available in 20 markets, global Apple Pay purchase volume more than tripled year-over-year and weÃ¢ÂÂre delighted to be expanding to Brazil in the coming months.
We're very happy with the initial response from reviewers who've experienced HomePod ahead of its launch, and we think our customers are going to love this new product.
When we look at average revenue per week, our growth rate was even higher at 21% with growth across all product categories for the third consecutive quarter.
Diluted earnings per share were $3.89 also an all-time record and cash flow from operations was very strong of $28.3 billion.
Average weekly iPhone sales were up 6% compared to December quarter last year with growth in every region of the world despite the staggered launch of iPhone X.
We established all-time iPhone revenue record in nearly every market we track with double-digit growth in all of our geographic segments.
The latest data from 451 Research indicates U.S. customer satisfaction ratings of 96% or higher across iPhone models.
During the week beginning December 24th, a record number of customers made purchases or downloaded Apps from the App Store, spending over $890 million in that seven-day period, followed by $300 million in purchases on New YearÃ¢ÂÂs day alone.
And when you look at our track record of what weÃ¢ÂÂve done over the last several years, youÃ¢ÂÂve seen that effectively we were returning to our investors essentially about 100% of our free cash flow.
How youÃ¢ÂÂre thinking about the potential decay rate, for lack of a better term, with the high-end phones and over $1,000 phone versus balancing that with now your ability to ship phones down below $400, because youÃ¢ÂÂve expanded the product line so much when you launched your phones in 2017?
We think about the advances in technology that were a part of the iPhone X from -- we went from Touch ID to Face ID; Face ID has been incredibly well received; the wireless charging, the edge to edge super retina display; and totally new gestures, the user experience is different.
When you think conceptually about the path for iPhone X Style devices going forward.
So you have an install base thatÃ¢ÂÂs 20% plus higher, and a unit growth that relatively flat, which would suggest that your upgrade rate is going down or your replacement cycle is elongating.
I think you're asking, are there more active users today than there were two years ago when we had 1 billion active devices.
When you talked about reducing Apple's net cash levels to zero effectively over time, I think that implies -- the number goes from $163 billion today to something like zero.
We generated revenue of $88.3 billion, which is above the high-end of our guidance range, and it is up almost $10 billion or 13% over the previous all-time record we set a year ago.
When we look at the average revenue per week in the December quarter this year compared to last year, our growth was a stunning 21%.
iPhone X was the best-selling smartphone in the world in the December quarter according to Canalys, and it has been our top selling phone every week since it launched.
The number of paid subscriptions across our services offerings passed 240 million by the end of the December quarter, thatÃ¢ÂÂs an increase of 30 million in the last 90 days alone, which is the largest quarterly growth ever.
In addition to the App Store, several other services had a biggest quarter ever, including Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Pay, all of which saw growth in both active users and revenue.
It was the third consecutive quarter of growth for iPad revenue, thanks to the strength of both iPad and iPad Pro. Worldwide, almost half of our iPad sales were the first-time tablet buyers or those switching to Apple, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs true in some of our most developed markets, including Japan and France.
Thank you, Tim. Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional, as we set new all-time records for revenue, operating income, net income and earnings per share.
Starting with revenue, weÃ¢ÂÂre reporting an all-time record, $88.3 billion, up nearly $10 billion or 13% over the prior record set last year.
Our results were terrific all around the world with double digit revenue growth in all our geographic segments, an all-time quarterly record in the vast majority of markets we track, including the U.S., Western Europe, Japan, Canada Australia and Korea, as well as Mainland China, Latin America, The Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, and India.
In Greater China, we were very happy to generate double digit revenue growth for the second quarter in a row and in emerging markets outside of Greater China, we saw 25% year-over-year growth.
We exited the December quarter towards the lower end of our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory with less than 1 million more iPhones in the channel compared to the December quarter a year ago, in line with our growth in average weekly unit sales.
We had a terrific quarter with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year and up 27% in terms of average revenue per week; that is an acceleration to the 24% services growth run rate that we experienced in the September quarter.
In fact, wearables were the second largest contributor to revenue growth after iPhone, which is impressive for a business that started only three years ago.
Next, IÃ¢ÂÂd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.1 million Macs during the December quarter, which translates to 2% year-over-year increase in average sales per week.
On a worldwide basis, the active install base of Macs was up double-digits year-over-year to a new record.
The active install base of iPad has grown every quarter since its launch in 2010, and it reached a new all-time high in December, thanks to extremely high customer loyalty and large numbers of first-time iPad users.
Traffic was particularly strong during the four-weeks following the launch of iPhone X, up 46% over last year.
As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call; we expect revenue to be between $60 billion and $62 billion; we expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%; we expect OpEx to be between $7.6 billion and $7.7 billion; we expect OI&E to be about $300 million; and we expect the tax rate to be about 15%.
And I think as Luca said earlier, when you change that for an average weekly sales basis, itÃ¢ÂÂs actually 22%.
But if I look at March quarter guidance, it does assume a slower average weekly growth in total revenue, as well as, I think on my math, iPhone shipments when you compare it to the December quarter.
And maybe the two most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as compared to last year, during the March quarter.
And also and importantly that iPhone sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis will be actually accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December quarter.
For the balance of the Company, in the aggregate, we expect to grow strong double-digits year-over-year and particularly very strong performance in service and in wearables like weÃ¢ÂÂve seen during the December quarter.
And specifically the numbers this quarter as reported are 11% increase for Greater China year-over-year but on an average weekly revenue basis, we were up 19%.

We're proud to announce the results of a very successful quarter today, setting new March quarter records for both revenue and earnings.
iPhone gained share during the quarter based on IDC's latest estimates for the global smartphone market.
Revenue topped $9 billion for the first time, up more than $2 billion over last year's March quarter.
We had all-time record revenue from the App Store, from Apple Music, from iCloud, from Apple Pay and more, all of which are a powerful illustration of the importance of our huge active installed base of devices and the loyalty and engagement of our customers.
This was another outstanding quarter for our wearables business, which includes Apple Watch, Beats and AirPods with combined revenue of almost 50% year-over-year.
In March, we announced new products for the education community, including updating our most popular iPad with support for Apple Pencil.
Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. We're very pleased to report record financial results for our March quarter with revenue growth of 16%, EPS up 30%.
Performance was very strong in emerging markets where revenue was up 20% and we were especially pleased to see 21% year-over-year growth in Greater China, our strongest growth rate from that segment in 10 quarters.
During the quarter we sold 52.2 million iPhones, up 3% over last year, and we grew iPhone units by double digits in several markets including Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico and Vietnam.
We had a sensational quarter with all-time record revenue of $9.2 billion, and that's up more than $2 billion from last year, an increase of 31% and double the services revenue we generated in the March quarter just four years ago.
Our services business is growing at a very fast pace all around the world, with revenue up more than 25% year-over-year in each of our five geographic segments.
The App Store set a new all-time revenue record in the March quarter and Apple Music reached a new record for both revenue and paid subscribers, which have now passed 40 million.
Our other product category also set a new record for the March quarter with revenue of almost $4 billion.
We began shipping HomePod in February and unit sales of both Apple Watch and AirPods reached a new high for the March quarter.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac which set a new March quarter revenue record including new records in both the Americas and Greater China.
We sold 4.1 million Macs, generating year-over-year growth in many emerging markets including Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and India.
We were happy to see double digit growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high, with almost 60% of March quarter purchases coming from customers who are new to Mac. Growth was particularly strong in Japan, in Latin America, Middle East and Africa and Central and Eastern Europe.
NPD indicates that iPad has 53% of the U.S. tablet market in the March quarter, up from 40% share a year ago.
Year-over-year growth was led by iPhone as well as strong performance from AirPods and introduction of HomePod. During the quarter, we opened beautiful new stores in South Korea and in Austria, our first in both countries, and three weeks ago we opened our newest store in Tokyo, bringing us to 502 stores across the world today.
Given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value that we see in our stock, our board has authorized a new $100 billion share repurchase program which we will start executing during the June quarter.
Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Luca.
Given the $1,000 price point, and it's clearly selling but there's been a lot of questions in the market about sustainability of that price point and how you're thinking about it as you look out sort of holistically across your lineup.
I think that our iPhone line shows that there's a variety of different customers in a market that is as large as a smartphone market and so we're going to continue to provide different iPhones for folks to meet their needs.
On iPhone X specifically, I think it's important to maybe emphasize again one of the things I mentioned in my opening comments, that customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each and every week in the March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter.
And underneath that, if you look at the subscriptions, the number of subscriptions, I think I mentioned this in my comments, paid subscriptions had moved up over 100 million on a year-over-year basis to over 270 million by the end of the quarter.
And I think the other good news is that because our active installed base is at such a level, that last quarter we said that we had exceeded 1.3 billion.
And so with that kind of change in the installed base and with the services that we have now and others that we are working on, I think this is just a huge opportunity for us and feel very good about the track that we're on.
So the dividend is a very large component of capital return because we're going to be returning more than $13 billion a year to investors through dividends but we believe that given where we are with the valuation of the stock, we think that we continue to do the buyback primarily.
White - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc. Yes, Tim, I think there is China numbers are actually phenomenal in the quarter and third consecutive quarter of growth.
On the market side, we've seen iPhone X, as I had mentioned before, as being the top selling smartphone during the quarter.
At the same time, it's very difficult for me to give you an indication of what is going to happen in the future because every product cycle is different, and as you know, we don't provide guidance past the current quarter.
Good day everyone, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call.
For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the Associated Press release.
iPhone's second quarter performance capped a tremendous fiscal first half with $100 billion in iPhone revenue, an increase of $12 billion over last year, setting a new first half record and achieving our highest first half growth rate in three years.
Apple Watch had another great quarter with revenue growing by strong double digits year-over-year to a new March quarter record.
And whether it's through our coding programs, our unrivaled augmented reality platform, or the creativity both can unleash, we're proud to help students everywhere reach new frontiers of learning with Apple technology.
Tax reform makes it possible for us to execute our program more efficiently, both through share repurchases and payment of dividend to the tens of millions of investors who own Apple stock either directly or indirectly from large pension funds to individuals with retirement accounts.
Diluted earnings per share were $2.73, up 30% to a new record for Q2, and cash flow from operations was very strong at $15.1 billion.
Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was even stronger than our reported results, as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.8 million units, 600,000 units more than the March quarter reduction last year.
We sold 9.1 million iPads and about half of purchases were by customers new to iPad. All markets where iPad sales were up double digits compared to a year ago.
Our stores hosted more than 250,000 of our very popular Today at Apple sessions with a particular emphasis on coding and app design.
We paid $3.2 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $23.5 billion on repurchases of 137 million Apple shares through open market transactions.
As we said 90 days ago, the new tax legislation enacted in December gives us increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our global cash.
Could you just maybe help us understand, how does Apple protect consumer data?
",59.67,0.8547979
apple,q3,2018,"Today we're proud to report our best June quarter revenue and earnings ever thanks to the strong performance of iPhone, services and wearables.
Our third highlight of the quarter is the outstanding results in wearables which comprises Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats and was up over 60% year-over-year with growth accelerating from the March quarter.
Apple Watch delivered record June quarter performance with growth in the mid 40% range, and we're thrilled to see so many customers enjoying AirPods.
We're working with key partners in the enterprise to change the way work gets done with iOS and Mac. And now, for more details on the record June quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.
Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. We're very pleased to report the financial results of our best June quarter ever.
We generated $53.3 billion of revenue with year-over-year growth in all of our geographic segments and new June quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific.
During the quarter, we sold 41.3 million iPhones, with double-digit unit growth in several markets including the U.S., Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico, Hong Kong, Russia, the Middle East and Africa.
We generated double-digit services growth in all our geographic segments and the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, cloud services and Apple Pay all set new June quarter records.
Our other product category also set a new record for the June quarter with revenue of over $3.7 billion.
Apple Watch continues to be the best selling smartwatch by a wide margin and units and revenue grew dramatically during the quarter.
Our retail and online stores had a great quarter thanks to very strong growth from iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch and the expansion of HomePod to Canada, France and Germany.
As you will recall, our September quarter results last year included a one-time favorable adjustment of $640 million to our services revenue.
We had double digit services growth in all of the geographic segments and the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, cloud services, Apple Pay all set new June quarter records and of course subscriptions have now passed the 300 million, as I'd mentioned before, and so we couldn't be happier with how things are going.
Looking forward, you know we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter, but I think we have a pretty good record over the last several years to make good business decisions, balancing units, revenue and margins.
Yeah, Shannon, we feel great about the results on iPhone, up 20%, and if you look for the cycle, by the cycle, I mean Q1, Q2 and Q3, we've had on an average weekly basis, growth in units of sort of mid single digit and ASP growth of double digit.
We did pick up share in iPhone and iPad, but if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had double digit growth from services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product category which the watch did extremely well, and so there are lots of good things happening there.
Our revenues on Apple Music grew over 50% as I'd mentioned earlier during the quarter, and so some really, really strong results.
In terms of our installed base, which is something very important for us as it is one of the key drivers of services, our active installed base on iPhone grew double digits over last year during the quarter and so we're thrilled with that and you can see that carrying through to the services line and the growth that we had there.
Part of that is on HomePod but part of it is with the Apple Watch and the iPhone and the iPad, and so I think home is important.
The question I have is are they actually on-ramps into the Apple ecosystem, the Beats, the Watch, the AirPods, subscriptions, are they on-ramps into the ecosystem or is the on-ramp to the ecosystem the iPhone and then these new products add revenue per member once you get somebody into the ecosystem via the iPhone?
Good day and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, share repurchases, dividends and future business outlook.
Second, we had a stellar quarter in services which generated all-time record revenue of $9.5 billion fueled in part by double-digit growth in our overall active installed base.
The App Store turned 10 years old this month and we set a new June quarter revenue record.
To put that tremendous growth into perspective, this past quarter, we completed more total transactions than great companies like Square and more mobile transactions than PayPal. Apple Pay is now live in 24 markets worldwide with over 4,900 bank partners and we look forward to adding Germany later this year.
Apple Pay Cash, our peer-to-peer payment service, is already serving millions of customers across the U.S. less than eight months following its launch.
Later this year, Charter Communications will begin offering Apple TV 4K to its customers in nearly 50 million U.S. households, providing access to live channels and tens of thousands of on-demand programs via the Spectrum TV app on Apple TV 4K, iPhone and iPad. And tvOS will take the cinematic experience of Apple TV 4K to the next level this fall with support for Dolby Atmos audio and new features to easily find popular shows and movies.
We're welcoming communities and offering learning opportunities at our retail locations through hundreds of thousands of Today at Apple sessions each quarter.
We're expanding our reach into emerging markets and seeing strong double-digit growth in revenue and we're making great progress toward our goal of significantly expanding our services business.
Net income was $11.5 billion, up $2.8 billion or 32% over last year and it was also a new June quarter record.
Diluted earnings per share were $2.34, up 40% and also a new record for the June quarter and cash flow from operations was very strong at $14.5 billion.
Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 3.5 million units during the quarter.
Even with a difficult launch comparison, we saw great momentum in many emerging markets, with growth well into double digits and we established new June quarter records for Mac sales in India, Turkey, Chile and Central and Eastern Europe.
Our overall performance compared to last year was impacted by the introduction of new iPad Pro models in June of last year which resulted in both a different mix with higher ASPs and channel sale a year ago.
And leading global automotive companies are deploying iPads in dealerships for sales enablement and end-to-end customer service management and are choosing iPhone as the standard mobile device for their employees around the world.
We're also seeing great interest in Business Chat, our powerful new way for organizations to connect with customers.
Business Chat lets customers get answers to questions, resolve issues and complete transactions directly from within Messages by starting a conversation on their iPhone or iPad and even continue the conversation on their Mac or Apple Watch.
We repurchased $20 billion worth of Apple shares of which $10 billion related to the completion of our previous $210 billion buyback program and $10 billion to the beginning of the new $100 billion authorization we announced three months ago for a total of 112.8 million shares repurchased through open market transactions during the quarter.
As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing different providers pick up the Apple TV and use it as their box to go to market with their subscription service.

Record results from iPhone, services, and wearables drove our momentum and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segments.
Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X, and the very successful launch of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. The A12 Bionic is many years in the making and a huge technological leap forward.
iOS devices deliver the best AR experiences of any products in the market today and with the announcement of our new iPad Pro this week, we've made that gap even wider.
We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and new all-time revenue records for the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music and Apple Pay. We set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue, thanks to strong performance in MacBook Pro and the impact of the back-to-school season.
With revenue growth over 50%, it was another record quarter for wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products.
Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year, with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia-Pacific.
As Tim mentioned, we reached new all-time quarterly revenue records for many services categories, and we are well on our way to achieve our goal to double our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020.
At over 100 million units, our active installed base of Macs is at an all-time high, and the majority of customers purchasing Macs in the September quarter were new to Mac. We generated iPad growth in a number of key regions around the world, including Latin America, Europe, Japan, India, and South Asia.
Other products revenue grew 31% to a new September quarter record with an increase of over $1 billion compared to a year ago thanks to wearables growth of over 50% and the strong performance of Apple TV, in addition to the introduction of HomePod earlier this year.
Before we discuss our December quarter outlook, I'd like to describe a number of changes in our financial reporting that we're implementing as we enter our new fiscal year.
First, given the increasing importance of our services business and in order to provide additional transparency to our financial results, we will start reporting revenue as well as cost of sales for both total products and total services beginning this December quarter.
Third, starting with the December quarter, we will no longer be providing unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and Mac. As we have stated many times, our objective is to make great products and services that enrich people's lives, and to provide an unparalleled customer experience so that our users are highly satisfied, loyal and engaged.
We have the strongest lineup ever as we enter the holiday season and we expect revenue to be between $89 billion and $93 billion, a new all-time record.
Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Luca, and we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to two questions.
I think Luca mentioned in his comments that the largest Ã¢ÂÂ if I look at the largest developer, they make up less than 0.3% of the services revenue, so it's probably good to think about that in that context, and there are millions of apps on the store obviously, and 30,000 or so subscription apps.
And our guidance range, by the way, represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record.
The third point that I think it's important to keep in mind, and Tim has talked about this, we are launching, in the last six weeks, we've launched an unprecedented number of new products.
When you look at our financial performance in recent years, take the last three years, for example, the number of units sold during any quarter has not been necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business.
Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Looking at one additional point there just for clarity is, Shannon, our intention is to continue to give revenue guidance at the company level and gross margin guidance in the other categories that we've been providing and so that our guidance isn't changing.
Mike, as we said, during the September quarter, we set new records for many, many services categories, right, from Apple Music to cloud services to the App Store to AppleCare and Apple Pay really has an exponential trajectory right now.
The installed base of all our major product categories is at an all-time high and has been growing over the last several quarters, so the opportunity for us to monetize our services business continues to grow over time.
In terms of reporting results, one of the things that we are doing, and it's new and it's in addition to the information that we provide to investors because we've heard some significant level of interest around this, is starting with the December quarter, for the first time we're going to be providing information on revenue and cost of sales, and therefore gross margins for both products and services.
And this will be the first time that we're going to provide gross margin information for our services business, which we believe is an important metric for our investors to follow.
To give you an example, the unit sales of iPhone at the top end of the line have been very strong during the September quarter, and that's very important because we're attracting customers to the most recent technologies and features and innovation that we bring into the lineup, but you don't necessarily see that in the number that is reported.
Good day and welcome to the Apple Incorporated fourth quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings conference call.
iOS 12 is delivering system-wide performance enhancements, Siri Shortcuts, and new tools to help people reduce interruptions and manage screen time for themselves and their kids.
And 10 months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest-rated mobile peer-to-peer service by Consumer Reports, based on exceptional payment authentication and data privacy.
The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4 has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by its all-new design, larger display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced cellular reception and electrical heart sensor.
We hosted over 250,000 Today at Apple sessions this quarter, connecting aspiring creators with local photographers, illustrators, and other experts who can help them get the most out of their devices.
We're also excited that educators in more than 350 schools around the world have started working with Everyone Can Create, the free collection of tools and project guides we introduced this spring, designed to help unleash kids' creativity throughout their school day with the help of iPad. This is a great example of how a commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive once unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems, and beautiful solutions that set us apart.
We are extremely pleased to report record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic segment and established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter.
We saw great response to our new MacBook Pro models that we launched in July, with strong double-digit revenue growth driving an all time quarterly record for Mac revenue.
And the most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 96% for both iPad and iPad Pro. As we look back across fiscal 2018, we've made great progress in the enterprise market, where iOS is transforming how business gets done across multiple industries.
Deployment of iOS devices is growing steadily as retailers replace their traditional point-of-sale systems and use custom iOS apps on iPhones and iPads to provide highly personalized shopping experiences.
IBM Watson services for Core ML, and the IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple that are enabling businesses to combine machine learning and cloud for a new generation of dynamic smart apps made for iOS.

We noted four factors that would impact our results when we provided guidance in November: different iPhone launch timing from a year ago, FX headwinds, supply constraints on certain products and macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets.
Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than we anticipated, our business grew outside of China, including new records in the Americas, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and our rest of Asia Pacific segment.
We generated record December quarter services revenue in Greater China, fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5 million registered iOS developers.
We also continued to grow our total active installed base by adding new customers.
And I'm very proud to say that nearly 16 years after launching the iTunes Store, we generated our highest quarterly music revenue ever thanks to the great popularity of Apple Music now with over 50 million paid subscribers.
The App Store wrapped up its best year ever with record holiday period results propelled by the biggest Christmas Day and Christmas week ever.
We also had our best quarter ever for Wearables Home and Accessories with 33% growth in total and almost 50% growth from Wearables, thanks to strong sales of both Apple Watch and AirPods.
It's humbling to read e-mails from customers around the world telling us how Apple Watch has dramatically changed their lives by motivating them to be more fit and active, by alerting them to potentially serious health conditions such as AFib and by helping them in times of crisis with features like fall detection and emergency SOS.
Our results were especially strong in the U.S. where revenue was up by more than $1.5 billion compared to a year ago and in several markets where revenue grew by double digits including among others Germany, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Malaysia and Vietnam.
On a sequential basis, products gross margin increased 60 basis points due to positive leverage from the holiday quarter, partially offset by higher cost structures as we launched several new products and by headwinds from foreign exchange.
Services gross margin also increased 170 basis points sequentially due to favorable mix and leverage, partially offset by foreign exchange.
On a geographic basis, most of the decline from last year came from Greater China and other emerging markets with difficult macro and foreign exchange conditions affected our results.
Our retail and online stores generated strong results for Mac and iPad and all-time record performance from Services and from Wearables.
With custom iOS apps available to production operators across their worldwide locations, SKF has reduced production errors from 20 percent to zero while saving 70% in system-related time.
This range reflects a negative year-over-year impact of $1.3 billion from foreign exchange, which represents about 210 basis points of last year's revenue and a more uncertain macroeconomic environment than a year ago, especially in emerging markets.
Yes. Luca, looks like the midpoint of your Q2 revenue guidance implies the steepest Q1 to Q2 sequential decline in iPhone revenues in history.
And we expect that the key factors that Tim mentioned during the call affecting iPhone performance in Q1 will also have an effect on Q2 starting with the strong U.S. dollar environment.
And Apple's clearly doing that by helping with the battery replacement program, iOS working on an older range of products et cetera.
But I guess the question is why doesn't that mean that replacement or upgrade cycles for iPhones should continue to extend going forward in part because that's almost one of your objectives?
And maybe to that end, maybe you can help us understand what iPhones' average replacement cycle might be today, and how that may have changed over the last three to five years.
This isn't the first time you've heard from us regarding the December quarter, so the first thing I want to do is provide some final results and connect those back to the letter we shared at the beginning of the month.
In fact, more than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during the December quarter were purchasing that product for the first time.
As a result, we estimate that less than half of iPhones sold in Japan in Q1 of this year were subsidized compared to about three quarters a year ago and that the total value of those subsidies had come down as well.
What's very important, however, is that in spite of these factors, our total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3 billion at the end of January of 2018 to 1.4 billion by the end of December reaching a new all-time high for each of the main product categories and for all five of our geographic segments.
In fact Services revenue set an all-time record at $10.9 billion in the December quarter growing 19%.
We not only generated our highest global Services revenue ever, but we also had all-time records across multiple categories of Services including the App Store, Apple Pay, cloud services and our App Store search ad business and we had a December quarter record for AppleCare.
We launched Apple Pay in three new countries in the December quarter Germany, Belgium and Kazakhstan and is now live in 27 markets around the world.
Revenue from cloud services continues to grow rapidly with year-over-year revenue up over 40% in the December quarter.
iPhone revenue declined 15% from a year ago while revenue from the rest of our business grew 19% to an all-time record, including our best results ever for Services, for Wearables and for Mac. This quarter for the first time, we're making an important new disclosure to our investors as we believe it will foster a better understanding of our business.
However, our global active installed base of iPhones continues to grow and has reached an all-time high at the end of December.
To be clear and as we've already explained 90 days ago, our 2020 goal remains unchanged and it excludes the impact of the revenue reclassification between products and services we recorded in connection with ASC 606, the new revenue recognition accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2019.
The number of transacting accounts on our digital stores reached a new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts growing by strong double digits over last year.
Our active installed base of Macs reached a new all-time high and half of all the customers purchasing Macs in the December quarter were new to Mac. We also had great results for iPad with revenue up 17% from a year ago.
Similar to the Mac, our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high and among customers purchasing iPad during the quarter half were new to iPad. Wearables, home and accessories revenue grew 33% to a new all-time record in each of our geographic segments.
Revenue from this category was up over $1.8 billion compared to a year ago, thanks to the amazing popularity of Apple Watch and AirPods both of which were supply constrained as we exited the quarter.
Following the launch of the new iPhone trade-in campaign, our stores more than doubled the volume of iPhones traded in compared to last year, reaching an all-time high in Q1.
The second factor for the growth of the services business is that within this installed base the percentage of users who are paying for at least one service is growing very strongly.
Then we took Apple Pay to Safari, then we started a peer-to-peer service and we're launching it in new markets across the world every quarter, so we are broadening that scope.
And of course, similar to what we've done in the past in the last three years, we launched several new services, we're also looking to launch new services going forward that we believe will provide great value to our users and we're really very excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us.
I think an important point I need to make, and I think it's helpful that you asked the question, is that a portion of this deceleration is truly just a reclassification of the amortization of free services that we've made in connection with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.
The reclassification is actually dilutive to our growth rate because the amortization of free services is a relatively stable number, which gets applied to a growing base.
But in general, we are very, very pleased with 19% growth and we think that the business will continue to grow nicely going forward.
And then my other -- my second question is just, when you think about growth in Services, you have selling more to existing paid subscription customers or it's the 300 million going to 0.5 billion.

apple,q2,2019,"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook.
It was our best quarter ever for Services with revenue reaching $11.5 billion.
And Ticketmaster has just announced that they will be accepting Apple Pay for ticket purchases on the web and through the Ticketmaster app, and over 50 of their entertainment and sporting event venues are launching contactless tickets this year, including the vast majority of NFL stadiums.
The App Store is already the world's biggest gaming platform and we think Apple Arcade is a great way to unleash the creativity of the game developer community with a collection of new games not available on any other mobile platform or in any other subscription service.
And users can subscribe to and watch new Apple TV channels like HBO Showtime and Starz paying only for services they want all on-demand available on and offline.
Just like when the ECG app launched in the United States, there's hardly a day that goes by that I don't get a letter or an e-mail from a customer in one of these countries talking about how this feature has significantly changed their life.
This will be the first record sharing platform of its kind available to the VA, which is the largest medical system in the U.S. providing service to more than nine million veterans across more than 1,200 facilities.
We've completed the allocation of our $2.5 billion green bond proceeds across 40 environmental initiatives around the world to projects ranging from solar power generation to water conservation to development of custom alloys for our products made from 100% recycled aluminum.
We are as excited as ever about our great pipeline of hardware, software and services and we're looking forward to sharing more information about the future of our four software platforms at our Worldwide Developer Conference now less than five weeks from now.
Overall, products revenue declined 9% driven primarily by iPhone, while Services revenue grew 16% to a new all-time record.
Services gross margin was 63.8%, up 100 basis points sequentially due to a different mix and leverage from higher revenue.
The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached another new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts, also setting a new all-time record and growing by strong double-digits over last year.
iPad revenue growth has been fueled primarily by the great customer response to our new iPad Pros.
Wearables Home and Accessories revenue set a new March quarter revenue record of $5.1 billion fueled primarily by the strong performance of our Wearables business, which grew close to 50%.
It's reaching many new customers with three quarters of purchases going to customers who have never owned an Apple Watch before.
We generated very strong double-digit revenue growth from Apple Watch and iPad. We're making important progress in the enterprise market, helping transform major industries.
We've been making great progress expanding Apple's footprint beyond the cockpit into the cabin, where more than half of the top 50 airlines have now implemented iOS to enhance the guest experience as well as enable a new use case with mobile point-of-sale.
AT&T will enable business services for Apple products to help companies with their IT strategy, including device management, security, productivity and collaboration.
Thanks for the color Tim. And as my follow-up Luca can you just clarify if the settlement with Qualcomm is creating either a headwind or a tailwind to your gross margins in the near-term?
Is that reaching a point where it's become material and maybe moving the needle for overall services revenue?
Okay and thank you for taking my question.
While we grew year-over-year in developed markets, and while we had record March quarter results in a number of major markets including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan, we did experience a revenue decline in emerging markets.
Our year-over-year revenue performance in Greater China improved relative to the December quarter, and we've seen very positive customer response to the pricing actions we've taken in that market, our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores, the effects of government measures to stimulate the economy, and improved trade dialog between the United States and China.
We believe strongly in our long-term opportunity in China, thanks to our robust ecosystem, our talented developer community, and the country's growing population of tech-savvy consumers who value the very best products and services.
Importantly, our active installed base of devices continues to grow in each of our geographic segments, and set a new all-time record for all major product categories.
That growing installed base is a reflection of the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, and it's driving our Services business to new heights.
In fact, we had our best quarter ever for the App Store, Apple Music cloud services, and our App Store search ad business, and we set new March quarter revenue records for AppleCare and Apple Pay. Apple Pay transaction volume more than doubled year-over-year, and we're on track to reach 10 billion transactions this calendar year.
Late in the quarter, we launched an all-new iPad Air with an ultra-thin design, Apple Pencil support, and high-end performance powered by Apple's A12 Bionic chip.
As we mentioned in January, we've been working on an initiative to make it simple to trade in a phone in our store, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the old phone to the new phone.
Across our stores, we had an all-time record response to our trade-in programs and with more than 4 times the trade-in volume of our March quarter a year ago.
We're in the fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business and invest confidently in our future, so today we're announcing the latest update to our capital return program including an increase to our share repurchase authorization and our quarterly dividend.
Thank you, Tim. Revenue in the March quarter was $58 billion near the high end of the guidance range that we provided 90 days ago and down 5% from last year.
We also set a new March quarter record for Wearables Home and Accessories, and we recorded our best iPad growth rate in six years.
We're seeing positive customer response to recent pricing actions in certain emerging markets, as well as enhancements to our trade-in and financing programs.
As Tim said, it was our best quarter ever with $11.5 billion in revenue, an increase of 16% from last year.
As you can see from our new disclosures, Services accounted for 20% of our March quarter revenue and about one-third of our gross profit dollars.
Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. On a global basis, nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac and the active installed base of Macs reached a new all-time high.
We had our best March quarter ever for iPad in Japan, and we were especially pleased by performance in Korea, Thailand and Mexico where revenue more than doubled over last year.
In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the March quarter were new to iPad and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high.
Also as a reminder, in the June quarter last year, our Services revenue included a favorable $236 million one-time item in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits.
Of course, we are supporting both our products and services business and you can see the trajectory of our OpEx over the different quarters.
Geographically, of course, as you've seen from our results for the March quarter, China is the geo where we found some challenges, but we believe the trajectory should improve over time.
And then just as a follow-up, Shannon said you're not going to talk specifics around the timing of the 5G phone, but Tim maybe you can talk about how the company approaches a new technology like this given the higher cost but also potentially significant benefit, how you think about the right timing for coming to market with a product, with those characteristics?
In your opening remarks, Tim, you'd mentioned about pricing adjustments that you made in some of the markets and then Luca talked also about the strength of the trade-in program or maybe it was Tim also.
Can you help us understand about what type of lessons or elasticity you've learned about pricing and the trade-in programs of how it impacts like revenues and COGS and margins and things?

apple,q3,2019,"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook.
We're thrilled to report a return to growth and new June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion.
We saw significant improvement in year-over-year iPhone performance compared to last quarter, very strong performances for both Mac and iPad and absolutely blowout quarter for Wearables, but we had accelerating growth of well over 50% and a new high watermark for services, where we set an all time revenue record of $11.5 billion.
Our active installed base of iPhone reached a new all time high and was up year-over-year in each of our top 20 markets underscoring the quality of our products and the satisfaction and loyalty of iPhone customers around the world.
Starting with services, we generated all time record revenue of $11.5 billion that's up 13% year-over-year and if we exclude the $236 million favorable one-time item from the June quarter last year, services growth was 15% or 18% in constant currency which is consistent with our Q2 performance.
Our strong services performance was broad based, we set new all-time records for AppleCare, music, cloud services and our app store search ad business and we achieved a new third quarter revenue record for the app store.
We had great results for Apple Watch, which set a new June quarter revenue record and is reaching millions of new users.
We had great performance from iPad, with revenue of over $5 billion, and growth driven by iPad Pro and by strong customer response to the new iPad Mini and iPad Air. This was our third consecutive quarter of growth, and with revenue up 15% year-to-date, we feel great about where we're headed with iPad. With our current lineup of iPad, iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro, we've got the perfect device for everyone from young learners to professionals.
I'd like to provide some color on our performance in Greater China, where we saw significant improvement compared to the first half of fiscal 2019 and return to growth in constant currency.
Thank you, Tim. We're happy to report a June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year.
We set June quarter revenue records in the Americas, in Japan and the rest of Asia Pacific and as Tim mentioned earlier all our geographic segments grew in constant currency.
Product categories outside of iPhone grew 20%, with strong results in Wearables, Mac and iPad. Services revenue grew 13% to a new all-time record of $11.5 billion.
Excluding the one-time item, we highlighted a year ago in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits, services revenue growth was 15% and 18% in constant currency terms.
On a geographic basis, we saw marked improvement in our year-over-year comparisons from emerging markets relative to the first half of this fiscal year, particularly in the BRIC countries, where year-over-year performance went from a 25% revenue decline in the first half to 3% growth in the June quarter.
In emerging markets, we returned to growth in Mainland China, grew strong double digits in India and Brazil and we set new Q3 records in Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.
Our active installed base of iPhone continued to grow to a new all time high in each of our geographic segments and in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research, indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone 10R, iPhone 10S and 10S Max combined.
Turning to services, we reached an all-time revenue record in spite of foreign exchange headwinds with double-digit growth from the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, and AppleCare, and triple digit growth from Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business.
All geographic segments had double-digit growth in services revenue and set new June quarter records with all-time records in the Americas and Rest of Asia Pacific.
The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all time high in the June quarter and the number of paid accounts grew strong double digits compared to last year.
Mac revenue grew in 4 of our 5 geographic segments and set June quarter records in the U.S., Europe and Japan, as our overall market performance significantly outpaced the global PC industry.
Nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, with revenue growing in both developed and emerging markets and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all time high.
iPad revenue grew in all 5 of our geographic segments, with a Q3 revenue record in Mainland China and double-digit growth in emerging markets.
In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the June quarter were new to iPad and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all time high.
Wearables, home and accessories revenue accelerated across all our geographic segments, growing 48% to over $5.5 billion and setting a June quarter record.
In addition, we generated double-digit revenue growth from Apple TV and accessories during the quarter.
Our retail and online stores produce their best June quarter revenue ever, with double-digit revenue growth across Apple Watch, iPad, Mac and accessories.
Luca, you gave us some color in terms of the growth rates in that, but I'm just curious and I know you won't talk about future products, but as you think about the opportunity, you think about what you've got now and in the future and then some of whatÃ¢ÂÂs been going on with China and that, is this something that could reaccelerate, or again, the 18% on a constant currency basis is obviously quite strong.
While the first one is for Tim, regarding the installed base comment you've made, which is quite encouraging, but yet when you look at the iPhone revenue year-over-year the past several quarters have been down.
Good day, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call.
We accomplished these results despite strong headwinds from foreign exchange which impacted our top-line growth rate by 300 basis points compared to a year ago that's equivalent to about $1.5 billion of revenue.
Our massive library of over 100,000 iTunes movies and TV shows, the app store where users can find their favorite streaming services and later this year, our original programming service Apple TV+.
Apple Pay is now completing nearly 1 billion transactions per month more than twice the volume of a year ago.
Based on June quarter performance, Apple Pay is now adding more new users than PayPal and monthly transaction volume is growing 4x as fast.
We also had our best WWDC ever last month, packed with announcements of great new features coming this fall across our four software platforms making them more powerful, more personal and more private.
iOS 13 offers great new ways to help you manage your privacy and security, including Sign On with Apple, which uses Face ID or Touch ID to quickly sign into apps and Web sites without sharing your personal information.
The redesigned home screen, powerful new multitasking tools and deeper integration with Apple Pencil take productivity and creativity further, including using your iPad as an extended and interactive second monitor for your Mac. For Apple TV, tvOS 13 will make the big-screen experience even more personal.
Apple Watch now has a dedicated App Store that users can access directly from the device and new watch faces, Siri enhancements, and music and audio features make Apple Watch more useful than ever.
A new tool included in macOS Catalina called Mac Catalyst gives developers a major head start in bringing their iOS apps to the Mac. Again, it's worth taking a step back and digesting the bigger picture here.
SwiftUI provides an intuitive new framework for building sophisticated user interfaces across our software platforms using simple easy-to-use code.
We also recently expanded our authorized service provider network and nearly 1000 Best Buy stores across the U.S. are now offering expert service and repairs for Apple products.
In addition to Apple retail stores there are over 1800 third-party Apple authorized service providers in the U.S., which is 3x as many locations as three years ago.
In the financial services industry, 90 of the largest 100 banks by assets size are deploying Apple products to improve efficiency and effectiveness across their organizations.
We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the quarter, including $17 billion through open-market repurchases of almost 88 million Apple shares and $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents.
Keep in mind that the guidance includes an estimated almost $1 billion of foreign exchange headwind for the quarter.

apple,q4,2019,"The significant upswing in demand in the final part of the quarter is mirrored in the overwhelmingly positive reviews, customer feedback and in-store response we've seen for this new generation of devices, not to mention a wave of the best photos you've seen from a smartphone.
For Services, revenue was $12.5 billion, that's up 18% over last year and it beats the previous record set in the June quarter by more than $1 billion.
We saw double-digit services revenue growth and all-time records in all five of our geographic segments, and it wasn't a narrow success either.
For Apple Pay, revenue and transactions more than doubled year-over-year with over 3 billion transactions in the September quarter exceeding PayPal's number of transactions and growing four times as fast.
Apple Arcade's subscribers get unlimited access to a curated selection of games from many of the most innovative developers in the world with almost 100 new titles playable across iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and Apple TV today and more are being added all the time.
Turning to Wearables, we had amazing results, thanks to the phenomenal popularity of Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products.
We had a tough comparison to last year's fourth quarter when we updated both models of MacBook Pro, but for fiscal 2019 overall, we generated the highest annual revenue ever from our Mac business.
Pulling back the lens from a single quarter, we are incredibly proud of our accomplishments over the course of a remarkable fiscal 2019, a year where we crossed $100 billion in revenue in the United States for the first time.
We introduce new services from Apple Card to Apple TV+ and generated over $46 billion in total services revenue, setting new yearly services records in all five of our geographic segments and driving our Services business to the size of a Fortune 70 company.
I'd like to thank our customers, our developers, our business partners and our employees for making fiscal 2019 such a success, and I look forward to another great year in 2020.
Thank you, Tim. Revenue for the quarter was $64 billion, up 2% from a year ago to a new September quarter record as we had predicted foreign exchange negatively impacted our revenue by close to $1 billion, and in constant currency, our growth was 3%.
Services revenue grew 18% to $12.5 billion, up over $1.9 billion year-over-year and almost $1.1 billion sequentially to a new all-time record with broad-based growth around the world and across our portfolio.
On a geographic basis, we set new fourth quarter revenue records in our Americas and rest of Asia-Pacific segments.
Our active installed base of iPhone continues to grow to a new all-time high in each of our geographic segments.
Turning to Services, we had a very strong quarter with all-time record performance and growth accelerating from the June quarter.
The new program complements our continued investment in our growing global network of over 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers the lead the industry for customer satisfaction and help millions of people with both in and out-of-warranty service for all Apple products.
Next, I would like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $7 billion, down 5% from last year due to a different mix of products, given the strength of our MacBook Air line-up and a difficult comparison to last year's launch of MacBook Pro models.
In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the September quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high.
Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new fourth quarter record with revenue of $6.5 billion, up 54% year-over-year with growth accelerating from the third quarter across all five geographic segments.
Our retail and online stores produced fantastic results, generating record September quarter revenue in all five geographic segments, and strong double-digit growth across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and accessories.
I think, we have opportunities, Amit, in both the growth of the installed base as Luca mentioned in his comments, we continue to grow across every category, hit new highs in the last quarter and we hit new highs in all of our top 20 markets.
Obviously, if you look at what we had launched in the last few quarters and few years, we launched a lot of new products, and now we are launching a lot of new services.
So given the enthusiasm about the iPhone 11 launch and the new Wearables products and the new services, I guess the question is, why is your guidance not stronger for Q1 on the top line?
We feel very good as Tim said about the iPhone, the way the new cycle has started, and we do expect an improvement in our year-over-year growth rate on iPhone.
On the bundle question, Toni, we look at each service, and decide what's best to do for it and with TV+, we concluded that a great way to get more people to see the content would be to do this, and it would be a good gift for our users, and so that's what we're doing.
That's a part of what we announced with the Apple Card earlier in the call and so we are cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of standard kind of basis and we are committed to make that easier to do than perhaps it is today.
And it looked like margins and revenues did well on that, and also followed some price adjustments you made in emerging markets last year, and obviously we've seen some improvement in China as well.
On the AirPods we're anxious to see the customers for the new AirPods Pro. But I would guess that one particularly in the early going will be people that have AirPods today and want to have -- also have a pair for the times that they need noise cancellation.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook.
iPhone 11 features the Apple-designed A13 Bionic the fastest most powerful chip ever in a smartphone plus an all new dual camera system and even longer all day battery life all wrapped in six great new colors.
iOS 13 is driving user experience forward across the iPhone family with a bold new look in dark mode, major updates to the apps our customers use every day, such as photos and maps, new ways to help protect their privacy with sign-in with Apple and performance improvements across the entire system.
Last month, we launched Apple Arcade, our groundbreaking game subscription service offering an all new way for the whole family to enjoy games online or offline.

Earlier this month, we released macOS Catalina with all new entertainment apps, the innovative sidecar feature that uses iPad to expand the Mac workspace and new accessibility tools that enable users to control their Mac entirely with their voice.
Products revenue was $51.5 billion, down 1% from last year, mainly due to iPhone, but largely offset by very strong performance from Wearables and iPad. Company gross margin was 38%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue.
All five geographic segments set new all-time Services revenue records and all grew double-digits.
Absolute revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions.
And to better meet our customers' needs, we announced a new iPhone repair program making it easier for independent providers across the U.S. to tap into the same resources as our Apple Authorized Service Provider network and offering customers additional options for the most common out-of-warranty iPhone repairs.
This iconic store is opened seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and provides an even better environment for customers to experience our latest products, meet with our geniuses, created pros and specialists, and attend our free daily Today at Apple sessions.

Services gross margin was 64.4%, up 30 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix.
Diluted EPS was also an all-time record at $4.99, up 19% and operating cash flow was a very strong $30.5 billion, an improvement of $3.8 billion over a year ago.
Our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high and is growing in each of our geographic segments.
App Store revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions.
iCloud also generated an all-time revenue record, growing very-strong double digits while offering our customers a safe, secure and seamless experience across all their devices.
We also continued to see strong demand for our products in the enterprise market as our technology solutions enable businesses to do their best work.
We also repurchased 40 million Apple shares for $10 billion, through open market transactions, and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents.
How much the growth you think is coming from first time buyers of AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have, because it looks to us the adoption rate is fairly low in your installed base, so there should be a long run way, but love to just understand how you see the growth divided between those two buckets.
The March quarter guide I think implies gross margin of flat to actually up 10, 15 basis point.
It's rare for you guys to actually guide gross margins up in March I think because you have a fairly high seasonal sales deleverage happening.
And then, my second question is I think you indicated that last month we started offering consumers the ability to use their Apple Card to buy an iPhone on an installment basis.
There is a general view that when 5G phones come out theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to be more expensive due to higher component costs, but at the same time, it looks like you guys have proven that there is a market for low cost geographies to phones like iPhone SE.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook.
We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings.
Our record performance was fueled by iPhone where December quarter revenue was up 8% year-over-year and by our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth outside of iPhone including a new all-time record for services and another blowout quarter for Wearables.
On iPhone, revenue in the December quarter was $56 billion, again thatÃ¢ÂÂs up 8% over a year ago, thanks to the exceptional demand for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. We had double-digit growth in many developed markets, including the U.S., the UK, France and Singapore, and also grew double digits in emerging markets led by strong performances in Brazil, Mainland China, India, Thailand, and Turkey.
Once again, we saw double-digit growth in all five of our geographic segments and established new all-time records from multiple categories including cloud services, music, payment services and our App Store search ad business, as well as setting a December quarter record for the App Store and AppleCare.
We had another incredible quarter, setting an all-time record in virtually every market we track around the world, and this product category is now the size of a Fortune 150 company.
Apple Watch had a great start to fiscal 2020, setting an all-time revenue record during the quarter.
Mac and iPad generated $7.2 billion and $6 billion in revenue, respectively, and the high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty for both products drove the active installed base of both Mac and iPad to new records in all geographic segments.
For iPad, we saw growth in key emerging markets like Mexico, India, Turkey, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, with our current line-up of iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad Mini and iPad, along with the new iPadOS will give the customers an unparalleled tablet experience integrating hardware, software and services in a way that only Apple can.
Thanks in part to a doubling in iPhone trade-ins versus last year, our retail and online stores set an all-time record and delivered strong double-digit growth in iPhone.
Thank you, Tim. Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional as we set new all-time records for revenue, net income and earnings per share.
Products revenue was $79.1 billion, up 8% as iPhone returned to growth, and we had incredibly strong results in Wearables where we set all-time records for both Apple Watch and AirPods.
Services revenue grew 17% to a new all-time record, $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in every geographic segment and new all-time records across our portfolio.
We set an all-time revenue record of $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in all of our five geographic segments.
As Tim mentioned, we established new all-time records for Apple Music, cloud services, payment services and our App Store search ad business and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare.
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both, transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits in all of our geographic segments.
Apple Music set an all-time revenue record, offering a catalog of over 60 million songs to our customers.
It was a December quarter record for AppleCare, thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution, many of our partners have come to appreciate the strength of the AppleCare brand and our ability to deliver the very-best service and support in the world.
Wearables, home and accessories established a new all-time record with revenue of $10 billion, up 37% year-over-year with very strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments and growth across Wearables, accessories and home.
We set all-time records for Wearables in virtually every market we track, even as we experience some product shortages due to very strong customer demand for both Apple Watch and AirPods during the quarter.
Amit, itÃ¢ÂÂs Tim. If you look at the Apple, the Wearables as a category within the Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue, Wearables grew 44%.
For the results from last quarter, we had double-digit growth for iPhone in Mainland China.
The 17% during the December quarter, we look at it against our fiscal year Ã¢ÂÂ19 growth rate, which was 16%.
And so, while these services did not have a material impact in our December quarter results, we expect that over time they start contributing to the growth of the services business.
Of course because weÃ¢ÂÂve launched the service very recently, the amount of revenue that we recognized during the quarter, was immaterial to our results.
There is a third category of expenses that affected the December quarter, and itÃ¢ÂÂs a fact that our revenue was very strong, and we have certain valuable expenses.
Based on the velocity and momentum youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing for the products exiting the quarter, how comfortable are you feeling about sustaining growth in iPhone revenues through year?
",50.4,0.93874156
apple,q2,2020,"Amid the most challenging global environment in which weÃ¢ÂÂve ever operated our business, weÃ¢ÂÂre proud to say that Apple grew during the quarter.
While our product teams were preparing to launch a new iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, MacBook Air and the new iPhone SE, all of which have been very well received by reviewers and consumers alike, they were also working with our suppliers to design, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5 million face shields, and we continue to ship more than 1 million of these every week to the doctors, nurses and medical personnel on the frontlines.
In the next five weeks of the quarter, as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, as well as demand for our products within China.
During the last three weeks of the quarter, as the virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including the closure of all our retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13th, and many channel partner points of sales around the world, we saw downward pressure on demand, particularly for iPhone and Wearables.
Apple will continue to do everything we can do to help the global response and to keep our customers learning, creating, sharing, and connecting so that life can remain as normal as it can during this challenging time.
Thank you, Tim. It has been a very different quarter than we were expecting when we last talked to you at the end of January.
So, the revenue for the quarter was $58.3 billion, up 1% from a year ago, despite the extreme circumstances from the impact of COVID-19 and a headwind of a 100 basis points from foreign exchange.
After a very strong January, our performance was impacted particularly during the last three weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures increase due to COVID-19 spreading around the world and affected our product sales.
iPhone revenue of $29 billion, declined 7% year-over-year as both iPhone supply and demand were affected by the impact of COVID-19 at some point during the quarter.
On the demand side, after very strong first five weeks, we saw the impact of COVID-19 affect demand in China for the next five weeks, and then more broadly around the world for the last three weeks of the quarter, when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures became more widespread in many countries.
Apple Music and cloud services, both set all-time revenue record and AppleCare set a March quarter record.
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow strongly, and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter.
For example, Apple Watch continues to expand its reach as over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch around the world during the quarter were new to the product.
Next, IÃ¢ÂÂd like to talk about Mac and iPad. Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter were new to that product and the active installed base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high.
First, customers are actively engaging with our ecosystem and digital services, and we believe the very strong recent performance in the App Store, Video, Music, and cloud services will continue throughout the June quarter.
Second, due to the overall reduced level of economic activity, due to the lockdowns around the world, services like AppleCare and advertising are being impacted.
We will continue to stay focused on what we do best, investing in our product and service pipeline, managing the business wisely, and taking care of our teams and believe we will come out from this stronger.
We think, by looking at it, a part of it is due to just our new products, a part of it is due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April, and then a part of it is probably the consumer behavior of knowing this is going to go on for a little while longer and getting some devices and so forth lined up to work at home more.
In particular for as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year-over-year basis during this quarter, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs customers that are either taking online education or working remotely.
But, as you can tell from what we did this quarter, despite the environment, we have our head down, are working because we know that our customers want the products that weÃ¢ÂÂve got.
Thank you, Tim. As a follow-up, I know youÃ¢ÂÂre doing a lot with both the Apple Card and financing plan for iPhones to get your products in the hands of customers.
And so, we expect our digital services to continue at the same level of performance that we have seen during the March quarter.
Given the overall economic environment, the level of demand right now, there are two businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during the June quarter.
And if you look up underneath the full quarter, we saw a strong January, and then a significantly reduced demand in February as the shelter-in-place orders and the lockdowns went into effect in China and the stores closed.
Please note that some of the information youÃ¢ÂÂll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the CompanyÃ¢ÂÂs business and results of operations.
At the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get our latest generation of devices manufactured and into our customersÃ¢ÂÂ hands, our worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of the Company were also sourcing more than 30 million masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring theyÃ¢ÂÂre donated to places of greatest need in every region around the world.
We worked with everyone from Oprah to Lady Gaga to inform, entertain and give back through Apple TV and services like FaceTime and Messages set new all-time records for daily volume during this quarter as users relied on their devices to stay connected in a new reality.
In software, at the same time that our teams worked with great creativity and excitement as we prepare to deliver our first ever all online Worldwide Developers Conference later this quarter, they also worked with the same creativity and speed to put together our COVID-19 symptom checking website and app in partnership with the CDC.
This extends of course to our retail employees, they are AppleÃ¢ÂÂs face to our customers and an instrumental part of our business and weÃ¢ÂÂre compensating them normally despite store closures.
While we felt some temporary supply constraints in February, our operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work and production was back at typical levels toward the end of March.
With new FDA guidance on non-invasive remote patient monitoring, for example, the ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measurements and recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and healthcare provider contact and exposure.
We have continued to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross-section of customers, including the all-new iPhone SE, which achieved unmatched technological capacity at an incredible value.
Importantly, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories.
Company gross margin was 38.4%, flat sequentially with cost savings and mix shift towards Services offset by the seasonal loss of leverage.
Our operations team and manufacturing partners put forth an extraordinary effort to restore production quickly, and we exited the quarter in a good supply position for most of our product lines.
As Tim mentioned, weÃ¢ÂÂre well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal Ã¢ÂÂ16 Services revenue during 2020.
App Store revenue grew by strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions.
Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased over 30% year-over-year, reaching a new all-time high.
Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new March quarter record with revenue of $6.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year with strong double digit performance across all five geographic segments.
And the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 95% for iPad and 96% for Mac. In the enterprise market businesses everywhere have been making the transition to working remotely.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve created content to assist our customers in this transition including an on-demand video learning series focused on topics like remote deployments of iPad and Mac and security.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve also realigned our own retail business and enterprise teams to provide timely and relevant support to customers as they navigate new work environments.
In essential sectors, such as grocery and financial services, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen organizations adopt our technology to better serve their customers safely.
We returned $22 billion to shareholders during the March quarter, including $18.5 billion through open market repurchases of 64.7 million Apple shares, and $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents.
We are in a typical supply position, including our usual ramp associated with new products recently launched.
Where do you see structural changes on the back of this health crisis that might present opportunities for new revenue streams at Apple?
I think, there are things from just a great reminder of how important our products are for remote work.
AppleCare is essentially comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements that we signed with our customers when they purchase our devices.
",47.86,0.88528794
boa,q2,2015,"WeÃ¢ÂÂve returned over $1.3 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends and looking at the results this quarter you can also see that we're making progress on our path to our long-term targets of return on assets and return on tangible common equity.
In the mass affluent space our Merrill Lynch product, it continues to have record assets and they were up 15% to over $122 billion and thatÃ¢ÂÂs on top of our investment brokerage services revenue teammates in U.S. We also continue to drive our 401(k) business and this year weÃ¢ÂÂve added some of the industryÃ¢ÂÂs largest companies to our platform.
In our middle market business, our commercial businesses, our companyÃ¢ÂÂs balance sheets are strong and they continue to drive loans at a higher rate than they did last quarter.
In the second quarter, we had $669 million of positive market related adjustments in net interest income, primarily driven by premium amortization on our debt securities from higher long-term rates.
On slide four, the balance sheet was up less than 1% versus the first quarter of '15 as loan growth and higher securities balances were offset by a decline in the ending balances within our global markets business.
If we look at lending activity on slide five, our reported loans on an end of period basis increased for the first time since the third quarter of 2013 growing $8.5 billion from the first quarter or 4% on an annualized basis.
Activity in our discretionary portfolio which is reflected in the LAS and all other box, where we used consumer real estate loans to manage interest rate risk in the LAS unit where we have home equity run-off portfolio together showed a decline from the first quarter of '15 of $15 billion.
In that light, global banking showed a continuation of loan growth from the end of the first quarter of '15, growing $11.4 billion or 4% during the quarter from a mix of C&I across large corporate and middle market as well as growth in commercial real estate.
If we adjust for those items our NII declined approximately a $100 million from the first quarter of Ã¢ÂÂ15 to just over $10 billion, as the impact of lower discretionary balances in consumer loan yields more than offset the impact of one more day of interest.
At the end of the second quarter an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel shift and increase in rates would be expected to contribute roughly $3.9 billion in NII benefits over the following 12 months and that split roughly 60% to short-end rates and 40% to long-end rates.
LetÃ¢ÂÂs go ahead and move to the businesses on slide 11, Consumer banking had earnings of $1.7 billion which was 4% greater than the second quarter of 2014 and 16% above the first quarter of Ã¢ÂÂ15 level.
Provision decreased $44 million from the second quarter of '14 driven by the continued improvement that we saw in both the credit card as well as the auto portfolios.
For example, the number of mobile banking customers continues to grow and increased to more than $17.6 million customers this quarter and these customers look to mobile devices for approximately 13% of all transactions -- all deposit transactions.
Mortgage banking income in this segment was up 8% from last year as originations had nice follow through from the elevated pipeline at the end of the first quarter as well as the higher productions margins.
Lastly, while we are bringing down our overall headcount in this business, we continue to invest in the growth opportunity of our preferred client base and we've been increasing sales specialists in the financial centers and that's resulted in increased activity.
If we turn to slide 13, Global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $690 million, which was up 6% from the first quarter of '15 level but down 5% from the second quarter of '14.
Compared to the second quarter of '14 solid fee growth was offset by lower net interest income, higher credit cost and modestly higher expenses, which resulted in a decline in year-over-year results.
Non-interest expense was modestly higher in the second quarter on the strength of our asset management fees as well as the continuing investment in client facing professionals.
If we look at activity and drivers on slide 14, asset management fees continue to grow and are up 9% from the second quarter of '14.
As I mentioned earlier we continue to experience strong demand in both our securities based and residential mortgage lending areas and we reached a new record for loans within the space during the quarter.
Earnings did decline 13% from the second quarter of '14 as lower non-interest expense was more than offset by lower net interest income, lower investment banking revenues and higher provision expense that was associated with the strong loan growth that we saw during the quarter.
Investment banking fees for the company were $1.5 billion, down 6% from the near record levels that we experienced during the second quarter of '14.
If we exclude a $188 million difference between periods on the sale of an equity investment, revenue was down 4% in the second quarter.
Sales and trading revenue of $3.3 billion ex-net DVA is down 2% from the second quarter of '14 levels.
Compared with the same period a year ago, fixed sales and trading was down 9% and not unlike what we saw in the first quarter of '15 strength within the macro-related products like FX, rates and commodities was offset by lower levels of activity within the credit product space.
So to wrap up, as Brian started the presentation with, many things that our teams have been focused on for some time came together nicely this quarter and that enabled us to report more than $5 billion in earnings and move closer to our long-term targets.
I think there is no question Betsy as we look at and I just remind people that we were at $3.9 billion for 100 basis point move.
If you look at the core net interest income ex the market related marks, it was down little bit versus last quarter but you are starting to see loans inflect as you mentioned earlier.
Do we start seeing stability in the core net interest income looking at the next quarter or two or do we really need higher short-term rates for that?
I think if you look at, we typically have a little bit of seasonal pressure in the second quarter and as we sit here today, based on the curve we would expect to see the core net interest income, which obviously excludes FAS 91 move up from Q2 to Q3 and weÃ¢ÂÂd expect further growth from Q3 to Q4.
Okay, and then on the discretionary book you mentioned it came down a little bit, when you look on a combined securities, mortgages basis and I guess as we saw long term rates go up and some banks have been increasing the discretionary book, with higher reinvestment rates or higher investment rates herein, whatÃ¢ÂÂs your thought on bringing that book down as rates have gone up?
But if you actually look at the amount of securities from a balance perspective they went up a little bit Q1 to Q2 based on the conversion of those loans to securities and as we continue to see the deposit footprint grow we will continue to invest and weÃ¢ÂÂre obviously mindful of the balance between increasing net income interest, like I spoke about as well as being sensitive to OCI risk.
Yeah, I think again, as we look and step forward that there are a lot of things that influence that number, one is obviously the ability and how much weÃ¢ÂÂve put up the increase in deposits to work through growing loans, and clearly weÃ¢ÂÂve seen, during the second quarter we saw that loan growth move up, which is obviously a good thing, which lessens some of that sensitivity.
And while this can bounce around a little bit I think what you're likely to see over the next couple of quarters is probably a convergence where the charge-offs and the provision number become more closely aligned.
As it relates to your question about the new loans, the responsible growth, if you looked and particularly in the areas that picked up during the second quarter, that on our risk rating scale they would translate to credits that tend to be in the strong triple B or single A area.
Just to follow up a little bit on that last point, when I was trying to shift through the core loan growth numbers this morning, it looked like the core loan growth coming out of the institutional bank and the wealth management looks strong.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs because we had -- weÃ¢ÂÂve been hitting increasingly record sales of credit card, so I think we did about $1.3 million this quarter, Bruce.
So if you look at that you can see itÃ¢ÂÂs across the board just little bit upside still, in part the interplay between some of the run off in the other category and the build-up in residential but they do a lot more themselves, loans in that place and so the investment sales levels that drives that Merrill Edge, in fact the FSA and the branches that we deploy do $4 million of notional on average a month of new investment products in building $4 million to $5 million, they sell, obviously check accounts, net check-in accounts this quarter we had a net check-in account growth position even taking into account the run off from divestitures and other things, and then you have the loan side.
So you can think of them - you're right that sales force -- that [ph] segment that it has a benefit across the board, and then services, a lot of our customers business, business banking, commercial banking customers coming to the branches obviously for cash related, really to the cash management revenue.
And I would just add if I may, if you look at home equity it's a good example of where, if you look within the consumer banking space and during the second quarter of this year the home equity originations of line amounts were about $3.2 billion.
The second thing I talked about better collateral management as well as looking to work, to do more compression and to net things out and we continue to see some benefit there.
Okay and then my second question, this just relates to the wealth management business and Bruce you alluded to there being a little bit of a slow down on the revenue.
The second thing that I do think is important is that when you look at the net interest income line, that as I've mentioned it looked a little bit muted.
Yeah, I say, a few quarters we saw the margin, the pretax margin come down and you are seeing it start to turn back and go up, and there is positive pressure on the future on that after the end of this year because some of the deal stuff runs out will add a couple of points to margin.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs got $250 billion deposits, round numbers, a lot of loans and it has a lot of the same sensitivity our consumer bank does, that people don't think of in this context.
But I think net-net if we do a good job of managing this the way that we would expect to, that absent any exogenous changes we should be able, in the institutional business, which is both global banking as well as sales and trading, that we should be able to grow loans while at the same time having -- have reductions in the overall risk weighted assets that are attributed to that area.
So, yeah I think itÃ¢ÂÂs really much more but a continuation of the work that weÃ¢ÂÂve been at for several years now, and weÃ¢ÂÂre mindful of making sure that we continue to push that stuff out at the same time that weÃ¢ÂÂre originating those things that will perform well as part of that overall exercise.
So think about that, that's up from 2,000 last year second quarter, 10,000 times a week now and growing at that rate implied there.
But if you think about, we've added mortgage production, check-in accounts, net new, the credit cards and thatÃ¢ÂÂs -- the ramification that we give service and driving it the team has continued to work at it.
So think about that, if people didn't like us a lot they wouldn't be giving us their core check-in accounts and that is happening more and more every quarter and that we will service well as rates change because we are a hugely primary focused check-in account company in the broad mass part of the business, which is different than the past.
So I'd be a little bit careful with that characterization and I think in that context I go back to Brian's initial comments which we continue to push hard, weÃ¢ÂÂre adding client facing personnel across the company at the same time we are reducing aggregate headcount and thatÃ¢ÂÂs leading to declines in the expense numbers, and weÃ¢ÂÂre very, very focused on continuing to keep that balance as we go forward.
And I think whatÃ¢ÂÂs important is as you look to the past, to what we have talked we are basically there in the second quarter you can say you have the $700 million in FAS 91 the 400 of loan sale gains and a couple of hundred million from rep and warrant provision but what I think is interesting and as you look at the past Eric, if you look at and assume the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve what that would mean in the quarter as well as if we ultimately get to where our LAS expense goals are you basically back to all other things being equal where we were this quarter.
I think this quarter was reflective of the way youÃ¢ÂÂd expect us to manage it which is the pure sales and trading number was down 2% and total expenses within the segment were down 5%.
So before I turn the call over to Brian and Bruce, let me just remind you we may make some forward-looking statements and for further information on those please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.
We saw continued improvement in our net charge-offs and credit quality; our deposits in our consumer continue to grow even faster this quarter than prior quarters.
This quarter again we averaged about 5,000 new customers a day to our mobile banking platform, but importantly the team continues to make progress in bringing that platform into the company in multiple ways.
The quarter also included $373 million in benefits from consumer real estate loans which added $0.02 a share.
Provision for credit losses this quarter was $780 million and included improved net charge-offs on an adjusted basis as well as less reserve release compared to the first quarter of 2015.
Return on tangible common equity this quarter was 12.8%, return on assets was 99 basis points and the efficiency ratio was 62%.
If we adjust for those metrics for the few items I mentioned earlier, return on tangible common equity was 10.9%, return on assets was 85 basis points and the efficiency ratio was 65%.
Common shareholdersÃ¢ÂÂ equity improved, the solid earnings growth was partially offset by a $2.2 billion decline in OCI and $1.3 billion in capital return to common shareholders.
Among other initiatives, the management team challenged our corporate and commercial lenders for the past several quarters to more fully utilize the credit limits, to drive responsible growth.
Our wealth management business continues to experience strong demand in both securities based lending as well as consumer real estate.
If we look at our Basel III regulatory capital on a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved $1.1 billion driven by earnings partially offset by the OCI decline, share repurchases and dividends.
Our global excess liquidity sources reached a record level during the quarter at $484 billion and now represents 23% of the overall balance sheet.
U.S. consumer credit card delinquencies improved as well and on the commercial front we saw an uptick in NPLs and reservable criticized exposure from the first quarter driven by downgrades in oil and gas exposures.
Releases in consumer card and consumer real estate were partially offset by reserve bills within the commercial loan growth area.
Card income increased 5% from the second quarter of '14 on strong sales and solid spend levels.
Card issuance reached almost $1.3 million units in the quarter on increased sales efforts while the average book FICO score was also strong.
Net charge-offs declined from very low levels and were 2.7% in the second quarter and risk adjusted margins remained high at roughly 9%.
Non-interest expense did decline 3% from the second quarter of '14 as lower litigation and other technology initiative costs were partially offset by investment in client-facing personnel.
Advisory fees were up 5% during the quarter, debt underwriting was relatively stable as increased activity in the investment grade and other products offset the declines that we saw within our leverage finance area.
Outside of investment banking fees other banking revenue declined from leasing gains partially offset by modestly higher treasury fees and card income.
Total revenue, excluding net DVA declined from the second quarter driven by lower equity investment gains, lower sales and trading results and lower investment banking fees.
Equity's trading was up 13% year-over-year driven largely by increased client activity within the Asia Pacific region as well as a strong performance within the derivative area.
The foundation of the company's balance sheet has never been stronger with record capital and record liquidity levels and we remain well-positioned to benefit from a rising rate environment.
I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs in the broadest context we continue to work expenses and if we talk to, about each quarter 18 straight quarter reduction in core operating expenses outside litigation, 15 straight quarters, 3,000 people or more reduction each quarter.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs really in your last question weÃ¢ÂÂve been investing in headcount to open up our customer facing capacity, so I replicated some of statistics earlier.
So all-in-all as we look at those different factors itÃ¢ÂÂs why weÃ¢ÂÂre comfortable saying that weÃ¢ÂÂd expect the quarter increase both Q2 to Q3 as well as from Q3 to Q4.
Great, thanks very much for the answers to my question.
Okay, just the whole idea there is just trying to get at the DOL proposal and maybe what could be potential downside even based on how it all gets finalized understanding that itÃ¢ÂÂs preliminary at this point?
Okay, and then looking at the branch declines that you guys referenced earlier, is the tweak on the sort of 5% year-over-year, as a reasonable decline rate sustainable from here given the trends that youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in your mobile platform and could this potentially add additional GUs [ph] to your expense decline beyond the business as usual type pushing that you guys spent a lot of time talking about here in the call today.
Hi, I just wanted a follow up on BetsyÃ¢ÂÂs question, at the start talking about expenses being at a run rate or maybe going lower.
And we will take our final question from Christopher Wheeler from Atlantic Equities.
",49.72,0.47526452
boa,q3,2015,"Our capital is again at record levels, and we returned over $3 billion back to shareholders so far this year through common share repurchases and dividends.
Our Merrill Lynch teammates who work within our consumer business helped push us through a new standard of 2 million accounts this quarter.
Thanks Brian, good morning everybody.
Tangible book value increased 10% from Q3 last year, and our tangible common equity ratio grew to 7.8% as equity improvements outpaced asset growth.
With regard to regulatory capital I want to start by pointing out that our transition ratios under Basel III increased with CET1 ending the quarter at 11.6%.
Non-interest income benefited from divestiture gains as well as higher card income driven by increased customer activity while service charges declined.
Expenses declined from Q3 last year despite a 5% increase in sales specialist and higher fraud costs in advance of ruling changes regarding EMV chip implementation.
The cost of operating our deposit franchise remains low at 180 basis points, and the consumer bank reported an efficiency ratio of 57%.
U.S. card credit volume was strong as net charge offs declined this quarter to a decade low of 2.5% driving risk-adjusted margins higher to 9.3% excluding divestitures.
Turning to slide 11, global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $656 million.
The trend of lower transactional revenues continued this quarter as clients migrated from brokerage to managed relationships which was compounded by lower markets and muted new issuance.
Second, operating leverage was challenged as areas of revenue where incentives are high like asset management grew while NII where incentives are much lower declined.
Turning to slide 13, global bankingÃ¢ÂÂs earnings were 1.3 billion, generating a 14% return on allocated capital.
The comparison to Q3 last year reflects higher provision expense and lower NII driven by the companyÃ¢ÂÂs ALM activities as well as increased liquidity costs.
Despite a lower level of IBCs this quarter, we maintained our number three global fee position and believe we increased our market share as industry fees pools declined.
On deposits we saw good performance with average deposits increasing by $8 billion over Q2 and we continued to optimize the portfolio improving the composition towards higher quality deposits from an overall LCR perspective.
Earnings were up from Q3 last year which included litigation cost of roughly $600 million most of which was non-deductible for tax purposes.
Total revenues excluding net DVA declined from Q3 last year driven by lower fixed sales and trading and to a lesser extent IBCs, offset partially by improved equity sales and trading.
Non-interest expense excluding litigation improved a $102 million versus Q3 last year, up 4% improvement.
Conversely, market activity remained muted in credit products driving lower client activity this quarter than Q3 last year.
As a reminder, our mix remains more heavily weighted towards credit products driven by the strength of our new issues capability and market share.
Lastly, I want to focus on expenses which excluding litigation were flat compared to Q2 as increased professional fees offset improved operating cost from the decline in delinquent loans.
The pretax loss was a result of a negative NII market related adjustments and an increase in provisioning for UK credit card payment protection insurance.
Sure so I am assuming some loan growth and adjusting for day count we would expect normalized NII excluding marketable adjustments to be flat to grind up and as long as rates donÃ¢ÂÂt decline in the future.
So core expenses which everybody excludes litigation LAS are expected to remain relatively flat at probably a little less than 13 billion per quarter in a moderately improving business environment.
We always manage the balance sheet against all the different constraints and you can see the improvement in the pro forma advanced ratio by 40 basis points this quarter closing down the gap.
Okay, secondly, another credit quality question.
Our next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
When we think about the quarter, the key message is we continued to make good progress in a tough revenue environment due to low interest rates and a sluggish economic recovery.
We continued to make progress towards our full earnings capacity here at Bank of America, and this quarter represents the fourth consecutive quarter of solid results following the resolution of our large legacy exposures in the third quarter of last year.
Our teams here at Bank of America are focused on the everyday engagement with our customers, deepening relationships by growing the core things we do with them, deposits, loans, managing their risks, helping them invest their assets, all while keeping our cost down, and you can see that in our results.
In our consumer banking business, as you can see, we grew revenue and earnings year-over-year despite the low interest rate environment.
When we go to our wealth management business, this business is showing the effects of lower market valuations pressuring revenue, but actively here has reflected good long term flows, good deposit flows, and good loan growth.
Our net interest income in the company is benefiting from loan and deposit growth showing momentum this quarter after you exclude the impact of FAS 91.
Expense less litigation LAS costs remain well below the $13 billion threshold at $12.7 billion, and that was in line with our second quarter despite the additional costs of CCAR and additional investments in the business.
We are taking the benefits of our simplify and improve program, which keeps our costs flat, while we continue to invest in customer-facing client people to grow our businesses.
So, in the context of the environment we faced, we are operating what we feel is a solid quarter, and as evidenced, the continuing progress on our strategy, our strategy of responsible growth with our customs.
Revenues were 20.9 billion this quarter, expenses were 13.8 billion, significantly lower than a year ago because of litigation costs and compared to Q2, expenses were flat as we managed costs well, while investing in our franchise.
Turning to deposits, on an ending basis, they reached 1.16 trillion this quarter, growing 50 billion or 4% over Q3 last year.
Excluding litigation, expenses were 13.6 billion in the quarter, a decline of 600 million or 4% from last year and consistent with Q2 despite additional costs related to our CCAR submission.
With respect to NII compared to last year, the benefit of higher deposit levels was more than offset by the allocation of ALM activity and lower card yields [ph].
In the future, mortgage banking income in the consumer segment will be lower by approximately $30 million per quarter given the Q3 sale of a small appraisal business.
On NII, the benefits of higher loan and deposit flows was more than offset by the company's ALM activities driving NII down from Q3 last year.
Long-term AUM flows were more than 4 billion, deposits increased more than 7 million, average loans were up 10% from last year, our 22nd consecutive quarter of loan growth in this segment.
Investment banking fees for the company this quarter were 1.3 billion, down 5% from Q3 last year.
Looking at the balance sheet, loans on average were $310 billion up 9% year-over-year and a similar percent relative to Q2 on an annualized basis.
First, the number of delinquency for mortgage loans continued to decline down 14% this quarter as the teams continued to work through solutions for customers.
I was just wondering if you can maybe just speak a little bit about the NII outlook given the dynamics about the stable balance sheet, shifts within the balance sheet, and how we should think about both the GAAP and adjusted NIM if the interest rate environment continues to look more or less like it does today.
In the fourth quarter, we think theyÃ¢ÂÂll wind up slightly based upon the realization of the expected forward curve and some loan growth.
I think we just look at commercial loans year-over-year at 10%, last quarter up 3% so you got to annualize that out and what weÃ¢ÂÂre looking at is that we replaced discretionary assets with actually good core assets.
Sure, so the short answer to your question but then IÃ¢ÂÂd like to elaborate a little bit more is yes we kept core expenses flat and we absorbed CCAR expenses and other investments in the business in the quarter.
Just take a step back I think the way we would ask you to think about expenses is we are seeing good expense progress within our business importantly as we continue to invest in the future.
One more point Brian, I would remind everybody that we did guide you that we would have increasing cost expenses in the second half of the year so we do have a little bit of that in the fourth quarter as well.
We are laser focused on keeping it to that kind of level where we continue to invest in the thousand plus people to go generate the business growth you are starting to see.
Okay, and then just separately in terms of the credit quality comments that you provided for the next several quarters, how are you thinking about energy as part of that?
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs all helpful and maybe just on the loan growth side what are you seeing on the demand side, consumer has begun to pickup for you guys where are you seeing the most strength and do you think the environment still is pretty positive from a loan demand perspective in the U.S.?
We think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a competitive advantage for people entering this business and we will continue to invest in that.
In terms of whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on in terms of the mix shift on balance sheet, added some of the discretionary assets and into the core loan growth, I think everybody will take that all day long.
I think as you think about it remember that if we go look at page 5 and you look at the content of whatÃ¢ÂÂs leading coming on especially in the consumer business and then think about running that through all kinds of models including the CCAR process and think about getting rid of $5 billion of home equity loans which are basically non performing and putting on $3 billion of good home equity loans, that dynamic is pretty favorable to the overall sort of calculation and so.
But donÃ¢ÂÂt think of it as changing credit quality or taking any kind of more risk, so Tom and Dean that run that business for us has done a good job and so IÃ¢ÂÂd say the supply has been more from a delivery capacity than it is from an expanding the box or anything like that.
But if you go on business banking, commercial banking, and global corporate investment banking segment, our three versions, [Indiscernible] the team theyÃ¢ÂÂve actually hired over a 100 people, loan officers this year.
Okay, got it, and then Paul one quick follow up on GWIM, just remind us how that business kind of marks itself in terms of the asset level pricing versus the transactions.
So what do we need to think about in terms of where the markets have come and where we are looking ahead in terms of assets levels versus transaction type revenue activity?
I mean we grew it a little bit slower this quarter but in a bad market environment we continue to grow AUM, we continue to grow deposits, we continue to grow loans.
Most have been asked and answered but one quick question on the servicing side, the servicing income has been coming down at sort of a faster rate than the portfolio and I know you guys have sort of exited most of the sales on the portfolio side, so at what point can we sort of expect the fees to level off and is that just a function of the legacy stuff continuing to run off?
In terms of what we do in the environment, as we have said a lot of times to earlier questions, we continue to be able to hold the core expenses flat while we make the investments pay - the increased CCAR expenses pay for the cost of repositioning the franchise, severance and everything and we will continue to work at it.
If the environment changed and we didnÃ¢ÂÂt think weÃ¢ÂÂre getting returns from that, [weÃ¢ÂÂll just go] [ph] for the long-term interest of our shareholders, we would reduce the investment rate.
",48.47,0.6759686
boa,q4,2015,"Our consumer and wealth management businesses serving mass market customers all the way to the wealthiest Americans delivered $9.3 billion in net income this year.
Our Global Banking business which provides services to small, medium and large companies around the world, produced $5.3 billion in net income this year.
As you see on slide 2, across the variety of measures, loan growth business activity, capital liquidity, credit losses and cost management, we've made meaningful progress and believe we are positioned for a variety of economic cycles.
Now our liquidity levels were driven by strong growth in deposits this year and we were able to put that funding to work to grow loans on an absolute basis for the first time in several years.
As you can see, we grew average deposits in consumer banking and wealth management business is $52 billion or 7% comparing year-over-year fourth quarter periods.
If you look at the markets business Tom Montag and team have done a good job of reducing assets and lowered the risk and still are generating relatively stable revenues.
Expenses were $13.9 billion approximately $300 million or 2% lower than a year ago driven by good expense discipline across the company.
We also provide returns and a few other metrics on this page, I would remind you that client activity and revenue in our global market segment tend to be lower or lowest in the fourth quarter affecting returns on other statistics.
Turning to slide 6 and focusing on the balance sheet, we grew deposits by $35 billion from Q3 and we used these increased deposits to fund responsible loan growth.
In total assets climbed $9 million as increases in loans and security balances of $30 billion were more than offset by reductions in trading related assets and cash.
Total net charge-offs increased $212 million versus Q3, $144 million was from consumer items previously reserved for and lower recoveries on the sale of NPL in the fourth quarter versus Q3.
Moving to our commercial side, on slide 10, net charge-offs increased $75 million primarily from losses in our energy portfolio.
Before moving from asset quality I want to refocus on total provision expense and how one should think about it over the next couple of quarters.
This improvement was driven by increased deposit balances which we used to fund growth in loans and securities.
Although more than half of that improvement comes from the increases in short-end rates and a little less than one quarter of the benefit comes from market related adjustments.
Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 13, consumer earned $1.8 billion, 9% greater than Q4 last year.
Results were down from Q4 last year driven by lower transactional revenue and the impact of the market decline on asset management fees.
Moving to slide 16, despite the volatility and market levels we continued to see solid client activity and we continued to invest in the business growing wealth advisors 5% from Q4 last year.
Provision expense was up $264 million from Q4 last year driven by higher energy related charge-offs and reserve build to loan growth and energy related risks.
Total revenue excluding DVA improved $330 million or 10% from the fourth quarter last year on improved FICC sales and trading.
I just wanted to dig in on a couple of things, one was on energy since itÃ¢ÂÂs flavor of the day, you gave a lot of color there and you indicated that those $30 holds for nine quarters that is a loss of $700 million.
Sure, look as we said in comments we have got reserves against that energy portfolio of $500 million, that is 6% of the high risk subsectors and we developed reserves on incurred basis, we developed them by looking at loss give default, probability of default, exposure to default.
That is kind of all run through the system, so now what weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing is $80 billion of a period deposit growth from fourth quarter last year and this year and the overall pay rate for that is in the low single digit basis points all for, all the consumer wealth management and driven by middle market and the banking business.
We think that makes sense and given the quality of our deposit base as Brian sort of kind of walked through already the portion we have in our consumer and GWIM franchises, the number of primary checking accounts even on the wholesale side if you look at our deposits less than 5% of them are 100% runoff deposits.
Well if you look at the full-year 2015 and you do those puts and takes for the things that weÃ¢ÂÂve talked about for the year and you make any sort of a reasonable guess as the progress weÃ¢ÂÂre going to make around LAS, weÃ¢ÂÂre sort of in the kind of 65ish range, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue to focus on growing responsibly and working on our total expenses as we have talked earlier and so with a little help from growth and some more work on expenses we think weÃ¢ÂÂre in shooting range .
As we model ourselves and look at sort of the peers and so that average efficiency by business units and model against our business mix weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be little higher, high level wealth management in our business relative to total.
But look three things on this, number one we will continue to drive Ã¢ÂÂ drive it down and funding all the growth in FTE for sales side we get 6% growth in consumer FTE sales side, 3% wealth management, 6% or 8%, maybe 8% global banking year-over-year.
So I think you put the heat on a little bit on loan growth over the last couple of quarters and if you looked at lending in your primary lending segments itÃ¢ÂÂs picked up and I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs good.
The question I have is, if you look at the core loan growth are you still okay running it at this level, do you feel like your customer base that youÃ¢ÂÂre making these new loans too are a little more insulated to the world that the market is fearful of?
I would remind everybody that we look weÃ¢ÂÂre very, very focused on our customer framework and our risk framework, but within that framework we continue to see a lot of opportunities that help our customers grow their businesses.
If you look at this quarter and you just focus on the core, we had 3% quarter-over-quarter growth or an annualized growth rate of little over 12% or $22 billion, IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to sit here and tell you that is what is going to be next quarter, but weÃ¢ÂÂre not seeing material decline in conversations with our clients about how that thing grows.
If you think about the consumer you know there was a prime no longer FICO scores if you look at the coming on FICOs are higher than the portfolio still which is almost hard to believe, the charge-offs, delinquencies and both home equities, delinquencies across the wide score are going to continue to come get lower every year.
And then again, as I pointed out, weÃ¢ÂÂve got a business here with close to $140 billion in loans and $240 billion, $260 billionish of deposits, and as rates move, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to start seeing some benefit from that with which the payout ratio is quite different than on the more traditional asset management products.
Yes, just I think people have to think about, Steven, the margin has come down, we think itÃ¢ÂÂs flooring out here and will start to pick back up in part because of some of the unfundamental changes in the ATP program running off and stuff, but we have invested in a PMD program, it cost a few hundred million dollars of drag to do that, thatÃ¢ÂÂs the right thing to actually build advisor base over time to service the clients.
But the one thing overall is that as you look at the question on the exposure that weÃ¢ÂÂre also paying close attention to is it sort of a demand or supply issue for oil prices, and if itÃ¢ÂÂs a supply issue that affects these companies and related companies demand and demand from, but if it is a demand in the broadest context, i.e., economies need to continue to slow down and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the broader concern.
And so, there is a balance here that weÃ¢ÂÂve got to think through right now thatÃ¢ÂÂs pretty isolated the energy companies, and even if you look at consumers who work for them in our basis by ZIP code and unemployment levels and stuff, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen relatively modest deterioration in the consumer side before employing these businesses.
I was just wondering if you could help me think through a little bit your GAAP and risk weighted assets over the first half of the year given the growth dynamics that are pretty robust in some of the run-offs and then also some of the changes that are going through on the RWA calculations?
Well on a standardized basis, I think youÃ¢ÂÂre going to see RWA trend up if weÃ¢ÂÂre able to grow deposits and loans.
I think itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be, continued to be driven by commercial, but you're going to see growth in consumers as well.
I would - there has been good progress, I think if you look over the last year, the number of non-conforming loans that we are originating has increased meaningfully.
From a broader -- leave aside the fees because of the geography and how the accounting works and when you put 60%, 70% loans on balance sheet, in terms of overall production we expect to continue to make progress because you can see that numbers that weÃ¢ÂÂre going to Ã¢ÂÂ as other people are flattening out, we continue to have lots of opportunities with our core customers setting out and still that are creditworthy in our customer base, we are still getting to move it elsewhere and that is what the team is chipping away.
Our credit people do spend a lot of time just homing [ph] through that portfolio and looking at cash flows from the companies and making sure we understand the collateral, making sure we fully understand our structures, so I think itÃ¢ÂÂs just a lot of locking and tackling and talking to clients and making sure we understand whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on with their businesses in terms of the energy portfolio.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve seen a little bit of increase the last couple of quarters, but that again I think is just a reflection of things that's bumping around at really low levels.
Rates get us part of it and hard work on expenses and core revenue growth and driving gets us the rest of it, and so LAS expense drop-in, and we're chipping away that, if you look from '14 to '15, we made substantial steps, and we will continue to drive away.
Within our institutional investor clients our markets business with its market leading research capabilities and the top tier platform across the globe delivered $3 billion in earnings after adjusting for DVA in a very challenging market.
These results reflect the work we've done over the past several years to develop a more straightforward and simplified operating model and focus on responsible growth.
Commercial charge-offs increased off a very low base mostly from oil related charge-offs while consumer losses as a core continued to improve.
We have record loan levels and significant higher deposit levels, good products and [advisers] [ph], a growing sales force and two of the leading brands in business positions us well here..
These included a negative net DVA impact in sales and trading that was more than offset by positive impacts of market related adjustments in net interest income and some one-off tax benefits.
Turning to regulatory metrics we began recording regulatory capital under the advanced approaches for the first time this quarter, and the CET1 transition ratio under Basel 3 ended the quarter at 10.2 and really has no comparable metrics as transition ratios in prior periods were reported under the standardized approach with lower RWA levels.
On a fully phased-in basis, CET1 capital improved modestly to $154.1 billion under the advanced approaches compared to Q3 2015 pro forma estimates the CET1 ratio increased slightly to 9.8%.
RWA was essentially flat as growth from commercial exposures was mostly offset by lower activity and balance sheet levels in our global markets segment.
Here our CET1 ratio was flat at 10.8% with modest improvements in capital offset by modest increase in RWA.
Turning to asset quality on slide 8, while still strong we did see net charge-offs increase modestly from recent levels.
Reserve releases in consumer real estate and credit card were partially offset by reserve builds in commercial which was driven by increase in criticized exposures as well as loan growth.
Turning to net interest income on slide 11, on an FTE basis NII was $10 billion increasing roughly $300 million from Q3.
NII also included a $150 million of positive market related adjustments to the amortization of bond premiums under FAS 91.
This is important because it allows us to invest in growth while maintaining relatively flat core expenses and a sluggish revenue environment.
Looking towards expenses in 2016 let me remind you, in the first quarter we will record as normal approximately $1 billion in cost for retirement eligible incentives.
These results reflect good operating leverage on increased customer activities.
Expenses declined 2% from Q4 2014 as the savings from reduction in financial centers and personnel more than offset higher product costs and investment in increased sales specialists.
U.S. card credit quality was strong as net charge-offs remained at decades low levels of 2.5% with risk adjusted margin of 9.4%.
Investment in client facing professionals continues while lower revenue caused a decline in incentive compensations that was more than offset by amortization of stock awards issued in prior periods.
Global markets earned approximately $200 million but we think one should consider results excluding DVA.
Compared to Q4 last year FICC sales and trading of $1.8 billion improved 20% reflecting improvements across most products notably in rates and credit related products.
Equity trading of $822 million declined 3% reflecting lower client activity.
[Operator Instructions] WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our first question from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
As you know, I think weÃ¢ÂÂve been talking about maintaining core expenses below $13 million.
Hey, good morning may be just a quick question on deposit behavior since the rate high, have you seen anything unusual I would assume will be more in the institutional side where youÃ¢ÂÂve seen movement at this point and then maybe you can kindly give some update on how youÃ¢ÂÂre thinking about the deposit data this year?
",51.55,0.7806216
boa,q1,2016,"We cut the number of legal entities in half and we also reduced costs through programs like New BAC that produced a loan more than $8 billion in annual savings and our SIM program which continues to operate today.
Long-term debt has been cut dramatically; deposits have increased over 20% and most of that growth is coming through our Consumer Banking and Wealth Management segments.
These earnings include the negative impact of the FAS 91 market-related adjustment, which reduced EPS by $0.07.
Before moving to the balance sheet I want to note an adjustment to the financial statements this quarter, reclassifying some operating leases.
And note that the first quarter included the $8.5 billion settlement payment to Bank of New York Mellon as trustee in the article 77 suit, which was reserved for over four years ago.
Loans outside the primary lending segments in LAS and All Other were down $10 billion from Q4 driven by continued pay downs of first and second lien mortgages as well as loan sales.
We had some immaterial movements this quarter from minor adjustments but overall very little change in consumer losses.
Commercial losses declined slightly from Q4 despite a slight increase in energy charge-offs.
While net charge-offs were flat, total reserve release declined as reserve releases in Consumer were mostly offset by reserve increases in commercial driven by energy exposures.
Consumer real estate charge-offs benefited from continued portfolio improvement and fewer one time items, primarily collateral valuation adjustments on consumer real estate.
Adjusting for those items, consumer net charge-offs were relatively flat versus Q4.
Moving to commercial credit on Slide 11, net charge-offs improved $35 million.
A decline in non-energy net charge-offs from Q4 more than offset a modest increase in energy losses.
Looking at our $7.7 billion utilized exposure to the higher risk E&P and oilfield services clients, we saw a decline of $600 million from Q4 as payoffs and charge-offs more than offset draw downs.
Included in NII this quarter was a FAS 91 negative $1.2 billion market-related adjustment for bond premium amortization.
About 40% of this estimated $6 billion increase comes from short end rate improvement and the rest is from long end rate improvement split equally between FAS 91 and reinvestment at higher rates.
First quarter expense also included FAS 123 annual retirement costs of $850 million, slightly below Q1 2015.
First quarter of both years also included about $300 million of seasonally elevated payroll tax expense.
Adjusting for all these items, i.e. This decline of $600 million from Q1 2015 was driven by: lower revenue-related costs associated with sales and trading in investment banking, as well as revenue in our Wealth Management business; the roll off of advisory retention awards put in place after the combination with Merrill Lynch; and lastly, SIM initiatives that are improving productivity and helping us lower costs so that we can continue to invest in growth.
These earnings reflect continued core customer growth coupled with strong expense management.
Lower provision expense from continued improvement in asset quality also benefited the bottom line.
Revenue increased $242 million or 3% from Q1 2015 as NII growth more than offset lower non-interest income.
Non-interest income was down due to lower mortgage banking income offset by increases in card income and service charges.
Focusing on Mobile Banking users in the upper right for a minute, we added 910,000 net new mobile users this quarter.
As weÃ¢ÂÂve discussed many times and shown here, we are originating high FICO loans that have produced very low loss rates and strong risk-adjusted margins currently exceeding 9%.
Turning to Slide 17, Global Wealth & Investment Management produced earnings of $740 million, up 13% from Q1 2015.
Overall, revenue declined 2% from Q1 2015 as strong NII growth was more than offset by lower market sensitive revenue.
Long-term AUM flows were down this quarter as a result of market volatility which impacted client behavior.
Average deposits grew $9 billion from Q4 and average loans also grew this quarter concentrated in consumer real estate lending.
Turning to Slide 19, Global Banking earned $1.1 billion, down from both comparative periods as energy reserves weighed on results.
Despite this increased provision expense, Global Banking was able to deliver a 12% return on allocated capital.
Global Banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks and this drove a nice increase year-over-year in NII, mitigated to some degree by spread compression.
Looking at trends on Slide 20 and comparing to Q1 last year, it was obviously a tough quarter for the capital markets with spikes in volatility causing declines in client activity.
All of this resulted in Global Markets reporting earnings just under $1 billion.
The number of 60 plus day delinquent first mortgage loans serviced continue to decline and is now only 88,000 units.
Results were impacted by the $1.2 billion FAS 91 market-related adjustment, the FAS 123 seasonal retirement eligible incentive costs and litigation costs.
If one adjusts this periodÃ¢ÂÂs reported results for the noncash FAS 91 market-related NII amount and the FAS 123 costs, earnings are largely in line with recent quarters.
Just maybe letÃ¢ÂÂs focus Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂll focus my question on expenses and then IÃ¢ÂÂll get back in the queue.
Our next question comes from Matt OÃ¢ÂÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
And going back to I think Jim's question earlier, the cost structure keeps moving in your favor as you keep driving this activity through.
Even today I think there's about a quarter million checks a day, people take a picture of them and send them in on their mobile phones and that didn't exist three years ago.
40% of the $6 billion is going to come from an increase in short end rates and then the other 60% is split equally between FAS 91 and reinvestment at longer term rates.
So we test that question you're asking which is what happens if residual values or used car values continue to Ã¢ÂÂ fell dramatically in a recessionary environment or something and that's one of the things we test, and it's not a big number.
So where did all those expense savings go or is this going to come through in future quarters?
Look in terms we are focused on driving down expenses every day, every quarter, every week.
It will Ã¢ÂÂ in some cases you would hope that it wouldn't go up a lot because that would mean asset management fees and other things are growing, which attach more compensation, less marginal profit, which will be good news, because the overall profit will grow better.
Brian, I think weÃ¢ÂÂve all over the last few years been trying to find banking normal and itÃ¢ÂÂs proving hard to find.
When you think about revenue, net interest income, excluding that bond premium adjustment, was $10.6 billion this quarter.
Of note, the downdraft in that was driven by Capital Markets and related activities and, to a lesser degree, mortgage servicing and other fees as we continue to wind down our third-party servicing book.
And if you focus just on the core costs excluding our LAS and litigation, those were down $600 million quarter Ã¢ÂÂ from first quarter of last year or $2.4 billion annualized.
Turning to Slide 3 and looking at the business segment earnings, you can see the good year-over-year results because of the operating leverage in those businesses.
Moving to Slide 4, during the period of Ã¢ÂÂ during the first quarter, there was a lot of talk with the market volatility, the Company buying surrounding the question about global growth and the forward-looking economic picture.
When you think about this, itÃ¢ÂÂs important to remember the work weÃ¢ÂÂve done over the past years to simplify and strengthen our foundation.
$3 billion in technology-related growth initiatives, especially in areas of digital practice, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs in Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, where we lead the industry with mobile and online platforms.
We intend to keep driving the core customer activity you see on the loan and deposit and customer flow growth in each and every business, focusing intently on the Wealth Management and Global Markets businesses to take advantage as markets have stabilized.
Expenses were $14.8 billion, approximately $1 billion or 6% lower than a year ago, driven by good discipline across the entire Company.
Okay, moving to Slide 16, this is a new page that presents some statistics around loan growth and the quality of originations in our Consumer segment.
Moving to Slide 18, despite lower market levels, we continued to see overall solid client engagement and we continue to invest in the business, growing client facing professionals year-over-year.
That NII improvement, combined with revenue growth from credit cards and treasury fees, partially offset a decline in investment banking and other marks on loans and hedges.
With $167 billion in tangible common equity, $12 billion in credit reserves and twice the amount of liquidity of a few years ago, we believe we are well prepared to help customers and clients in good and bad times and we are focused on growing earnings in many different economic scenarios.
Jim, I think thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot more to do here because at the end of the day adjusting the efficiency ratio for the two major adjustments, which wonÃ¢ÂÂt reoccur next quarter, you get in the mid-60 Ã¢ÂÂ 66, 67 and we need to drive that down in the low 60s even with the realities of the wealth management business not being as profitable and a big part of our revenue stream but very return on capital beneficial.
And so that digitization, which is Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂre at $19.6 million, Mobile Banking consumer customers.
We thought weÃ¢ÂÂd got it into the low 2s Ã¢ÂÂ 220, 240, and thought that was pretty good and now weÃ¢ÂÂre at 170, and my guess is we continue to push it down.
And so, we've absorbed a lot of that into the run rate and I think we're now to the point of fine-tuning the Company around the rules and regulations and continue optimizing it.
And then we've got obviously, as you spoke about, the continuation of finishing up the resolution plan, which we Ã¢ÂÂ has probably spent at least $0.5 billion on external parties to help us with and a lot of internal work.
And I think you can really see, when you look at those results, how much we've improved the credit quality of Company of both Ã¢ÂÂ across both Consumer and Commercial.
Do you think that can help in the buyback ask as you go through Ã¢ÂÂ it's not just a question about this year but just over time?
So there's opportunities for growth and that's Ã¢ÂÂ on the Consumer segment a lot of questions we get is how can you grow and keep your credit discipline?
When you flip it to the other side of it, yes, our job from the management team was to set this Company up to Ã¢ÂÂ it would never have the kind of risk embedded in it that would lead us to difficult times and a real recession, leave alone the CCAR analysis.
And if you think about in the Commercial book, it's Ã¢ÂÂ things like commercial real estate, we have been very disciplined and what we inherited through all the deals and development loans Ã¢ÂÂ all that stuff is really nonexistent at any consequence, so we feel very good about the Commercial book.
And then as I said earlier, Betsy, and you've followed our Company for a long time, you might Ã¢ÂÂ you would've seen a plateauing in the online Ã¢ÂÂ the computer-based banking, for lack of a better term, people coming in through BankofAmerica.com.
And if you look at the activity in the core customer base from card usage Ã¢ÂÂ both that in credit card usage up 4%-plus year-over-year, and that's good.
And you're absolutely right, driving all that out Ã¢ÂÂ near as we can tell, we spend about $1 billion a year just moving cash around in our company.
I was wondering about Ã¢ÂÂ on the net interest income side if you could talk a little bit about, Paul, what kind of outlook we should think about for the core net interest income.
But I think as you head to the third quarter and fourth quarter, when you consider what we're Ã¢ÂÂ think we can do on deposit growth and loan growth, and if rates follow the path along the forward curve, we would expect to make progress in the latter half of the year.
No, I wouldn't say Ã¢ÂÂ look, I think you heard from competitors that Asia was a little better in March.
Look, if you think about our ROA and you adjust for FAS 91 market-related NII adjustments and retirement-eligible expenses, you're going to get into the mid-70s.
Yes, it's Ã¢ÂÂ they are working on all the elements expense, so you've got that right.
So that's one of the operating leverage points in wealth management that we were losing a lot last year that we're going to get back as short-term rates rise because they are a heavy deposit business.
So really you still have modifications that Ã¢ÂÂ the re-modification work going on because people have had modifications for years.
Well, as we've told you, our target Ã¢ÂÂ our next weigh station on improving this thing is $500 million at the end of the year and we're well on our way to get there, Paul.
And so what we've got to execute on Ã¢ÂÂ it's not going to have the impact of when we had $3.1 billion of quarterly costs a few years.
But we're just Ã¢ÂÂ like I said earlier to Betsy on the Consumer side, we've got to keep moving this in the right direction and we have an idea where we'll get to, but we want to make sure we get the first piece out, it's $1 billion a year.
We've made, I think Ã¢ÂÂ so the key is we've got to continue to make progress on expenses and, again, I think we've demonstrated that we can do that.
We've got a lot of focus on this and I think you're going to continue to see progress.
I just want to get a sense as to whether we should be thinking about that 26% margin that we saw in the quarter as a good jumping off point, just given some of the tailwinds you had spoken to, whether it be the higher-margin NII growth and the absence of the legacy Merrill awards.
And as we think about the expense trajectory for this business, what should we expect in an environment where the trading revenues are relatively stable or consistent with what we saw in the most recent quarter?
I think we were disciplined this quarter in terms of our compensation expense and you saw that in the numbers.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been adjusting as you read about in the press, there is a Ã¢ÂÂ it's not in the run rate yet, it comes in next quarter because it happened mid-March.
I think the simple thing to think about in the investment banking Capital Market side is the work is ready to go, we just Ã¢ÂÂ if we continue to see the stability, you will see it come through.
I think itÃ¢ÂÂs just a question, as Brian said, of CEOs and Boards just making sure that the stability weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing right now is something that they can count on as they go to market.
So there are a lot of quarters where the core activity was growing but you couldnÃ¢ÂÂt find it because Ã¢ÂÂ if you look at the slide you can see the All Other, which is the investment portfolio, really mortgages and then the LAS assets are now small enough so that the quarter-to-quarter runoff.
So Ã¢ÂÂ but the core business is growing faster and then weÃ¢ÂÂre still running off, but weÃ¢ÂÂve told people to focus in at that level.
IÃ¢ÂÂm not sure you can consider first-quarter banking normal in the sense that we still have extra costs weÃ¢ÂÂve got a get out of here, Nancy, that we continue to work down.
And so, if you Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂve taken the balance sheet from implying at the time of Merrill, probably nearly to $800 billion or more, maybe closer to $1 trillion down to $500 billion and the revenues have stabilized and I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a good place for us to be.
So, we look at how we pare away things and look at it Ã¢ÂÂ so in the international business weÃ¢ÂÂve pared back Ã¢ÂÂ there was 1,200 Ã¢ÂÂ I donÃ¢ÂÂt know, 800 to 1,200 people that were downsized in markets and banking in the first quarter.
We continue to look at it, but right now we really like the franchise and the connectivity between the franchise of all the different elements, focused on markets, focused on wealth management, focused on the core business.
And I think now the question is with low rates, we just have to grind the cost down and thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to come out of really all the pieces and Ã¢ÂÂ well, for a while, it was Ã¢ÂÂ you could go at it at a fairly high level and drive it.
Improvement of core costs of $2 billion run rate first quarter last year to first quarter this year is not Ã¢ÂÂ is working at it.
So what weÃ¢ÂÂre actually Ã¢ÂÂ if you think about it as a real estate question, the number is not as important as they are full and that they are marginally driving the profit.
I wanted to focus on mortgage banking and the retention of those loans, more on the balance sheet than continuing to push them to the GSIBs. Is that regulatory driven or are you really looking for that higher retention rate because youÃ¢ÂÂre looking for some assets that have duration, so is that one of the better maybe option adjusted yields that you can get at this point?
And again, look Ã¢ÂÂ the facts are weÃ¢ÂÂve been growing overall, so year-over-year including those segments which, as you point off by our strategy are running off faster.
And I just wanted to understand did you have to do anything to build for that book of business or is this already something thatÃ¢ÂÂs in your run rate on the expense side and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be bringing in incremental revenues on the mortgage servicing side?
",58.15,0.6926387
boa,q2,2016,"Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements.
This quarter included negative market related NII adjustments that cost $0.05 per share and negative DVA that cost us another penny for a total of $0.06.
For example, this quarter we crossed over 20 million active mobile users and continued to increase their use of digital channels for both transactions and buying more bank products.
Active mobile banking customers logged into their accounts over 900 million times this quarter, depositing more than 25 million checks, with more than 20 million via mobile check deposits.
Global Markets generated $3.7 billion in sales and trading revenue excluding DVA.
Not only have net charge-offs not gotten worse, but they have improved in the most recent quarter moving back below $1 billion.
Consumer banking continue its momentum around client activity and operating leverage.
Under the advanced approaches compared to Q1 2016, the CET 1 ratio increased seven basis points to 10.5% and is above our current 2019 requirement.
RWA declined roughly 13 billion, driven by reductions related to retail exposures primarily from credit improvement.
The commercial net charge-off ratio excluding small business has been below 15 basis points for 14 consecutive quarters, even with the elevated levels of energy charge-offs we experienced over the past three quarters.
Looking forward to Q3, we will benefit from an extra day which will be offset by the impact of declines in long end rates over the past two quarters and put pressure on our MBS bond yields and reinvestment yields more generally.
Having said that, we made steady progress on reducing legacy loan servicing costs this quarter and we still expect to achieve our original goal of lowering the former LAS segment costs ex-litigation to $500 million in Q4.
As an example, I would note that our growth to mobile banking continues to play an important role in helping us optimize our delivery network while improving customer satisfaction.
Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, Merrill Lynch broker assets at $132 billion or up 8% versus Q2 2015 on strong account flows partially offset by lower market valuations.
Average vehicle loans are up 20% from Q2 2015 with average booked FICO scores remaining well above the 770 level and net losses remaining below 30 basis points and improving on a linked quarter basis.
As we viewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high FICO loans which generally produce low loss rates and strong risk adjusted margins.
This quarter included a modest gain from the previously announced sale of Bank of America Global Capital Management.
Double-digit percent revenue growth year-over-year offset a low single digit expense growth creating strong operating leverage that improved the efficiency ratio to 45%.
Global banking continues to drive solid loan growth within its risk and client frameworks producing solid year-over-year improvement in NII.
Customers and clients were able to live their financial lives better in Q2 because global markets delivered for them under challenging market conditions, helping them raise capital, buy and sell securities, as well as manage risk.
Excluding DVA and versus Q2 2015, FICC sales and trading of $2.6 billion increased 22% as the improvement which began in late Q1 continued through Q2 as global concerns abated and central banks took further monetary policy actions.
Equity sales and trading was $1.1 billion, declining 8% versus Q2 2015 which saw significant client activity in Asia driven by stock market rallies in the region.
We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and continuing to deploy technology that improves customer satisfaction.
WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our first question from Matt OÃ¢ÂÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve worked I think extraordinarily hard to transform the company, its balance sheet, its ability to produce earnings.
And while people always ask the question you ask, the answer is thereÃ¢ÂÂs still about seven out of 10 mortgage customers at Bank of America get their mortgage somewhere else that fit within our credit customers.
Maybe if you could help us think through Ã¢ÂÂ you talked about near-term kind of flattish, but as we think a little bit longer term, if the forward curve is realized and/or maybe give some color.
Whatever deposit growth doesnÃ¢ÂÂt get absorbed by good loans with our clients obviously goes into the investment portfolio and we get a return there.
So I think your point about what give us encouragement because you saw it last year second quarter, this year second quarter about how even in a lower for longer rate environment we can grow NII is that youÃ¢ÂÂre actually are growing the net loan book pretty consistently now each quarter.
WeÃ¢ÂÂll take the next question from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
So right now thatÃ¢ÂÂs around 75-ish percent of the loans weÃ¢ÂÂre originating are going on our balance sheet.
Hi. I apologize for going back to the net interest income issue, but obviously the reason why central banks keep interest rates down is because they expect it to increase lending.
We reported solid earnings of $4.2 billion after tax, or $0.36 per diluted share, in what was certainly an eventful quarter for the markets from an overall macro perspective.
At BAC, we focus on what we can control, and despite low rates and other macro events, we continue to focus on managing our risk, our costs and our delivery of quality products and customer service.
We can do that by continued success on things like expense management, by keeping NII stable to growing, stable and growing fees, and continue to manage risk well and hold down our credit costs.
However, in summary, adjusted for market-related changes in both last yearÃ¢ÂÂs second quarter and this yearÃ¢ÂÂs second quarter, we grew NII by 400 million or 4% year-over-year.
Going forward in a stable interest rate environment, we believe we can maintain NII around the second quarter 2016 level based on the current loan and deposit growth we see.
Sales and trading revenue including DVA for this quarter is the highest second quarter we have experienced in five years and it led to one of the most profitable quarters for Global Markets we have seen in the past five years.
Both those impacted both card fees and banking service charges and you can see them coming off the bottom as you look at the linked quarters.
Our mortgage business is now sized appropriately for our franchise and the fee line there Paul will talk about later, but will be as that near where itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be in the future.
But the important thing is we have strong businesses, strong client-facing businesses in these areas and weÃ¢ÂÂre getting our share of these revenue streams even while the markets ebbs and flows.
This continues a trend of performance that has shown expense declining significantly on a quarterly basis quarter-after-quarter over the past several years.
As we look out from the second Ã¢ÂÂ the third quarter of 2016 through the next six quarters into 2018, we believe that with our SIM efforts and the continued work weÃ¢ÂÂre doing across the board on expenses, weÃ¢ÂÂre targeting an annual expense number of around $53 billion in total expenses for the year 2018.
So over six quarters we continue to absorb investment, merit increases, rising healthcare costs, and bring the expenses down a nominal amount.
Our continued work in driving down costs to service delinquent loans will help with this, but the other reductions are generally coming from the core work and simplified improved.
But what I want to get to across to you is LAS as an operational segment successfully did what it was tasked to do: to clean up one of the largest mortgage servicing businesses in the U.S. From 1.4 million delinquent mortgage loans weÃ¢ÂÂre down to 80,000 a day.
Our global banking team drove results with continued solid loan growth, operating leverage of 9% and strong credit results.
So on a combined basis, those four business segments improved 16% from last yearÃ¢ÂÂs second quarter earning about $5 billion this quarter.
As you know, when general deposit flows drive the size of our balance sheet, and they on a lending basis were relatively flat this quarter as inflows were partially offset by outflows to fund seasonal tax payments.
Again, on an average basis year-over-year, loans and all other were driven by 42 billion driven by continued runoff of first and second main mortgages while loans in our Business segments were up 65 billion or 9%.
Broad-based growth was led by consumer, increasing more than 44 billion or 8% year over year, while wealth management deposits grew 6% and deposits with corporate clients and global banking improved nearly 4%.
Compared to Q2 2015, results were up nearly $400 million, or 4%, as higher short end rates combined with loan growth funded by deposits offset the negative impact of lower long end rates.
If we have stability in long end rates, we would expect to maintain that level in the near-term, again, assuming modest loan and deposit growth.
Rates moving up or down from here would obviously impact that perspective slightly in the near-term, but building as we extend that scenario into future quarters and years.
Turning to slide 11, noninterest expense was $13.5 billion in the quarter.
As the employee base continues to go lower, we think itÃ¢ÂÂs important to point out that the reductions on a percentage basis now include more highly paid managerial associates.
Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 12, consumer earned $1.7 billion, continuing its trend of solid improvement and reporting a robust 20% return on allocated capital.
Revenue and earnings were driven by deposit and loan growth coupled with continued expense improvement driving operating leverage.
As a result of this operating leverage, the efficient ratio improved roughly 360 basis points year-over-year.
The adoption and popularity of these capabilities continues to drive growth with record volume of $246 billion this quarter, up nearly 5% year-over-year.
Asset management revenues declined from Q2 2015 on lower market values while improving modestly on a linked-quarter basis.
Client balances at $2.4 trillion were down from Q1; but excluding the sale I mentioned earlier were up from Q1, as higher market valuation levels, $10 billion of long-term AUM flows and loan growth more than offset tax-related deposit outflows.
Global Banking earned $1.5 billion, producing solid improvement over both Q1 and year-over-year.
Looking at trends on page 18, and comparing Q2 last year, clients were comforted Ã¢ÂÂ excuse me, clients were confronted with increased volatility once again this quarter, with concerns around both global growth as well as the outcome of the U.K. referendum.
Switching to global markets on slide 19, the past couple of quarters are great examples of the importance of this segment to not only its clients around the world but also to our customers and clients in all our business segments.
In terms of revenue, this was the best second quarter we have had in the past five years.
But what we saw is that people were not sort of getting the expenses right in the out years thinking that we could not continue the rate of investment and continue to bring down expenses.
So I think it was consistent with the way weÃ¢ÂÂre running the company but we want to make sure that people had clarity over the next six quarters and going into 2018 of where we think the expense base goes versus what we saw in some of your guysÃ¢ÂÂ estimates and stuff.
Look, as I said in my comments, if rate follow the current path of the forward curve, we would expect with the extra day and the client long-term rates to be at around a $10.4 billion range in the next quarter.
So I think, look, itÃ¢ÂÂs just a question of the further you get out, the more that wave of deposits and asset growth kind of overwhelms the change in interest rates and we see growth.
Also if you look at page six, you can see that Ã¢ÂÂ a point you made is that the inflection point was hit a few quarters ago where the sort of the non-core loans and leases were running down and not being made up by growth.
But think about it as second quarter next year, youÃ¢ÂÂd start to see this breakthrough again, based on absolutely no change in rates from the low point they were.
But weÃ¢ÂÂre continuing to see declines year-over-year in card income, service charges and the brokerage business.
I think card actually is up on a linked-quarter basis, down year-over-year.
But I think over time as Ã¢ÂÂ if capital markets continue to rise, we will get Ã¢ÂÂ we will offset that decline in transactional revenue.
Admittedly itÃ¢ÂÂs a little tricky, because the actual rules only apply to the $200-odd billion of 401(NYSE:K) and retirement assets we have, but itÃ¢ÂÂs consistent with where weÃ¢ÂÂre taking the business and the team drawing we donÃ¢ÂÂt see meaningful revenue or changes due to that.
But the idea is we are going to take expenses from $56 billion in the last four quarters to $53 billion and we think thatÃ¢ÂÂs where weÃ¢ÂÂll get them to.
And I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to take away Ã¢ÂÂ I think we collectively appreciate having a 2018 expense target, but if you just take the second quarter annualized, youÃ¢ÂÂre at $54 billion, and then if you reduce your LAS expenses, you kind of get down to a $53 billion number.
Moved into the segments whether itÃ¢ÂÂs consumer, U.S. trust, or Merrill Lynch are the loans that relate to their businesses in terms of servicing costs, too.
I guess I was just Ã¢ÂÂ so youÃ¢ÂÂre saying that first of all on legal, the 53 billion includes roughly 300 million per quarter rate, and that your operating assumption for the GWIM and other market business would assume a revenue inflation and corresponding payout inflation from those businesses from here?
So if servicing is running off and not being replaced as fast, if weÃ¢ÂÂre holding more mortgages on the balance sheet as we transition from MBI to NII you could see that line continues sort of trend lower.
I think that trend lower is going to be, you know, in some quarters very slow because as you point out other items Ã¢ÂÂ other line items are a little bit messy and bounce around there depending on what happens with interest rates.
And despite both of those circumstances, we think in the out years we can grow NII or in the out quarters we can grow NII because weÃ¢ÂÂre growing deposits, and weÃ¢ÂÂre putting them to work where we can within our risk and client frameworks to grow well priced loans.
Brian has already pointed out all the work weÃ¢ÂÂre doing around expenses, so when you combine what we think we can do from a fee base, from an NII perspective and lowering expenses, we think we can grow earnings of a company even if interest rates are flat.
",49.89,0.791832
boa,q3,2016,"One thing before Brian and Paul get into the results, I just want to remind you we file an 8-K on October 4, giving notification the company changed our method of accounting for the amortization of premium and accretion of discounts related to certain debt securities known by the investment community as FAS 91.
We reported earnings of $5 billion or $0.41 per diluted share and EPS improvement of 8% from the year ago quarter.
Another question we get asked is, what can we do to drive earnings even if we stay in this low rate, low growth environment?
RWA declined roughly 20 billion, driven by reductions in global markets exposures and improvements in credit quality, driven by run-off of non-core legacy exposure.
Turning to asset quality on slide 7, we believe a number of factors including our strategy of responsible growth, enhanced underwriting standards since 2008, and a healthier economy have transformed the risk profile of Bank of America, as we look forward to future economic cycles.
Compared to Q3; Ã¢ÂÂ15, NII is up 3 million or 3%, as loan growth are shorter than rates and higher security balances funded by deposits more than offset the negative impact of generally lower long-end rates over the past several quarters.
Okay with respect to assets sensitivity as of 9/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by 5.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months.
Consumer earned 1.8 billion continuing its trend of solid results and reporting a robust 21% return on allocated capital.
Excluding those prior period gains, revenue improved year-over-year and growth in pre-tax, pre-provisioned earnings was even more substantial.
Looking a little closer at revenue drivers compared to Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15, net interest income continue to improve as we drove deposits higher.
Focusing on client balances on the left, in addition to deposit growth, Merrill Edge brokers assets at a 138 billion are up 18% versus Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15 on strong account flows and market valuations.
As we viewed in previous quarters, we continue to focus on originating high FICO score loans, which have generally produced low loss rates and strong risk adjusted returns.
Loan growth included consumer real estate production of 20.4 billion, up 21% from Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15 and in line with Q2 Ã¢ÂÂ16 as customers continue to take advantage of historically low interest rates.
NII benefitted from solid loan and deposit growth, non-interest income declined from Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15,driven lower transactional revenue that continues to be impacted by market factors as well as migration of activities from brokerage to managed relationships.
Moving to slide 16; we continue to see overall solid client engagement, client balances approached 2.5 trillion and are up from Q2 including higher market valuations, 10 billion of long term AUM flows and continued loan and deposit growth.
Clients can invest online, completely self-directed through Merrill Edge or if they are interested in enhanced professional portfolio management, they will be able to use Merrill Edge guided investing, or they can chose fully advised working one-on-one with the financial advisor via brokerage or fee based advisory platforms.
Return on allocated capital was 17%, a 300 basis points improvement from Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15, despite adding a couple of billion dollars of allocated capital this year.
Global banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks producing solid year-over-year improvement at NII.
Revenue growth also benefited from roughly a 175 million from gains on [NPL] this quarter versus loses in Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15.
Again this quarter, global markets delivered for clients by helping them raise capital, buying self-securities, as well as manage risk.
Excluding DVA and versus Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15, FICC sales and trading of 2.8 billion increased 39% as we built momentum as the quarter progressed across a host of credit products and continued gains in rates products.
Equity sales and trading were solid at $1 billion in revenue, but declined 17% versus Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15, which benefitted from higher levels of market volatility and client activity.
A loss in the current period compares to earnings of a 152 million in Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ15 as lower security gains and higher expense litigation offset higher mortgage banking revenue.
MBI revenue this quarter includes 280 million benefits from higher valuations on our MSR driven by slower expected prepaid speeds based upon recent observed trends and customer behavior.
We invested in our future by adding sales professionals and deploying technology that helps the customers better live their financial lives and improves satisfaction.
Just wanted to ask about expenses, could you talk about what kind of timing expectations you have under various projects helping to drive down your expenses further in 2017 and Ã¢ÂÂ18, maybe just remind us what are some of the big items that youÃ¢ÂÂre working on and should we still think about 53 billion in 2018 as kind of your hard target that youÃ¢ÂÂre shooting for.
And I would also just point out to remind everybody that if you look at expenses over a longer term, we reduced quarterly expenses ex litigation by 4.8 billion from Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ11, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a 19 billion run rate.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre seeing good momentum with more than 21 million mobile banking active users and thatÃ¢ÂÂs growing every week, every month.
Just curious for point of clarification, Brian had mentioned global markets, feels like itÃ¢ÂÂs taken a little share.
And that drop came again from legacy portfolios running off, and from a continued work by our goal markets team to better manage their balance sheet relevant to those ratios.
I think youÃ¢ÂÂre noticing some modest card balance growth in the quarter, which we think will continue as we add new accounts and again weÃ¢ÂÂre very focused on adding high quality accounts there.
I think you probably also noticed that while combined debit and credit card spend was good in the quarter at 5%, 6% of it could fuel, IÃ¢ÂÂm adjusting for our divestitures last year that the growth in the card camp was impacted by customer reward programs.
However just focusing on the fee income, this is some really key benefits of our strategy which is a track relatively higher quality card customers reward them for deepening their overall relationship with us.
This strategy really drives deposit growth and makes deposits stickier, plus we believe these customers have little loss rates, they used to (inaudible) which helps us lower cost.
The answer is, I think you said weÃ¢ÂÂll follow the customers and I donÃ¢ÂÂt know the exact number because I can tell you, eight years ago when we had 6100, there were people who said there was never going to be less branches in our system and maybe we should add more and guess what weÃ¢ÂÂre 4500.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs hard to value and youÃ¢ÂÂve got to be continually looking at that valuation and we thought it was time based upon observation of pre-payment speeds to make a change in some key assumptions.
But just to be clear, are you expecting improving, stable or deteriorating ROA based on the current competitive environment, because it seems like many peers are underscoring the near-term risks to profitability from awards and customer acquisition costs?
Again weÃ¢ÂÂre focused on prime and super prime, so originations were down modestly Q3 versus the prior quarter as we accepted a little bit less dealer flow, but we still feel good about that product offering.
I was hoping you can give us an update as to what portion of Merrill client assets are currently in brokerage IRA, and maybe more specifically, how should we think about the net economic impact from transitioning some of those retirement assets into some of the other offerings that you highlighted, whether it be fee-based which should generate higher fees versus robo or self-directed Merrill Edge?
Okay well that looked like obviously a technical question and itÃ¢ÂÂs not that we havenÃ¢ÂÂt thought about it, but to be frank, itsÃ¢ÂÂ just a speech at this point and he didnÃ¢ÂÂt really address that in his speech.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs not a quarter that when you look across four or five years that we havenÃ¢ÂÂt come close to on many cases and have done better than a few times.
I guess given relative to your $53 billion cost target for 2018 and the fact that the negotiations seem to be starting to gear up early next year, how youÃ¢ÂÂre thinking about the costs in the global markets and global banking businesses from Brexit if it ends up being a harder Brexit than a softer Brexit?
Couple of questions, Paul, your deposits at the Fed declined pretty sharply almost 20% linked quarter, even though you had deposit growth and given that long-term rates are still very low.
We continue to drive responsible growth and deliver more of the companyÃ¢ÂÂs capabilities to our clients and customers.
You can also see this in the growth of our Merrill Edge brokerage balances, which now total over $138 billion, adding investment relationships to the mass market customer base.
Our global wealth and investment management teams, US Trust and Merrill Lynch not only manage $2 trillion plus in investment balances, but also manage nearly $150 billion in loans and more than $250 billion in deposits, and we continue to see net flows of core assets in that business.
And then with our global peers restructuring, including in the markets business, I think this quarter is another great example of how global markets business is important to our investing and issuing clients.
We better client activity driving the best third quarter results weÃ¢ÂÂve had in the five years in investment banking and in sales and trading, and we are doing that with a smaller balance sheet, fewer people, and lower value at risk or VAR.
This is driven by changes we made right after the crisis, thinking 2008 and 2009 and the long term benefits of that effort continue to come through.
These deposits are growing because our capabilities in the business are the best in the industry and our customers and clients see that.
Our simplified and improved initiatives continue to help drive those costs down, and that leads to the question we also get asked.
So as we look forward, we are driving responsible growth and maintaining discipline on cost, and this has allowed us to deliver more capital back to you, and weÃ¢ÂÂll keep on doing that.
While the overall headcount is down, itÃ¢ÂÂs important to note that year-over-year we added over 1,000 primary sales associates across consumer, wealth management and global banking.
Average deposits continued their strong growth up 50 billion or 9% year-over-year, outpacing the industry.
We grew revenue, we grew deposits, we grew loans, we delivered for clients in capital markets, we lowered costs.
So if you think about what we have to do between and 2018, I think we talked about this before, roughly a third of that is going to come from continued progress on delinquent loan servicing.
As I said, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue to make progress on delinquent loan servicing cost, hopefully see some modest improvement on litigation.
What we know is client activity was up in the third quarter and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what drives our short term results.
So, in some of those, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to look a little bit different than some of our competitors in some places, but we feel good.
Betsy if you go to page six of the materials you can see that weÃ¢ÂÂre continuing in the mortgage area overall, so thinks both in home equity and first mortgage loan.
You can see that we continue to run off some of that non-core portfolio and overall the balances grow in the business segment, and we expect that to continue.
I think if you think about the growth, youÃ¢ÂÂve got the side and youÃ¢ÂÂve got the fee side and if you think about the interest side itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be driven by balanced growth between loans and deposits, and I think we keep growing deposits every year $60 billion weÃ¢ÂÂre paying four basis points in consumer and think about that dynamic and putting that to work in anything we can is important, and we continue to grow loans at less rate than we grow (inaudible).
If thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to drive our NIM, itÃ¢ÂÂs just a bigger and bigger, lower and lower cost deposit base.
And on the loan side, I think consumers growing better now than commercial in linked quarter, but overall we expect commercial will get back in a little bit as the economy continues and some of the uncertainty listed in the political season here.
On the fee side, what youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing is the dynamic and its specially fee areas finally turn a little bit stable and then turning for us in the card revenue and things like that, which would hit sort of the inflexion point where the run down and relative interchange due to selling some portfolios and getting out of non-core portfolios and putting on the core portfolios with rewards attached to which helps us generate deposit and things like that is stabilizing and starting to see in the last few quarters, card income starting to move up a bit.
Maybe you could talk a little bit about the credit cycle, I think one of the major pushback from investors is that weÃ¢ÂÂre going to start to see credit at worse.
I think I said it earlier, if you think about the last several quarters of earnings call, itÃ¢ÂÂs not going to get any better than this and every quarter it gets slightly better and that in part is because weÃ¢ÂÂre still getting the benefits of the changes made six, seven, eight years ago coming through the consumer business i.e. that what we call back book portfolios or legacy portfolios or whatever word you want to use continue to run-off with higher credit risk and we keep putting and have put on and continue to put on higher credit quality.
So if you think about overall charge-offs of 880 this quarter, thatÃ¢ÂÂs driven by the consumer business and thatÃ¢ÂÂs driven by the card and some in legacy home equities.
And so keeping the card business where we wanted is critical and youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing us continue, even as we start to see that portfolio both nominally and rate the charge-off picture strong.
Yeah, thereÃ¢ÂÂs always more to do, and we are focused on a lot of different regulatory metrics, and weÃ¢ÂÂre looking at all of them where there are some maybe a little bit more important than others right now and we are focused on all of them.
Obviously as we grow balance sheet, as we grow loans and deposits, we are going to continue to see some increase particularly on the standardize side.
But I think people always have to remember, the reason why we have more is because our deposits grew at $60 billion year-over-year and thatÃ¢ÂÂs more than our loans grew by quite a bit.
So, I guess the question is, if we do get a rate increase, do you think youÃ¢ÂÂve got more flexibility to limit the possible pricing given its basically worked so far and loan growth has obviously not enough to absorb the deposit growth you have.
And if you think about that, and thereÃ¢ÂÂs a dominate by our consumer business and our non-interest bearing accounts and consumer have doubled in size over the last five or six years due to focusing on primary accounts in the house or where they run their household finances through our account and therefore the correct deposit are check and things like that.
So, the first thing the number are [1 trillion] to 450 non-interest bearing and a dominant part of that consumer and also in the wealth management, (inaudible) transactional count of both consumers and then on the business side similarly we have driven our deposits to be really LCR friendly and core operating accounts.
And then when you go to the second dynamic, remember with all those deposit growth, one of the things we continue to do and the impact less and less is we are expecting consumer business running off CD still at a fairly decent cliff that were historically used to fund prior companies, balance sheets that we donÃ¢ÂÂt need the funding that caused.
We feel very good about the consumer deposit base just cross 600 billion for the first time in the companyÃ¢ÂÂs history and consumers generally, and with that I think if rates rise, we think that it is substantial value for the company and Paul gave you what you think about that earlier with a quarter of 3.3 billion, 25% of 3.3 billion.
I think when you want to see the effect of this, you have to look at the overall consumer segment and whatÃ¢ÂÂs going on there in terms of growth of profits and improvement in expenses.
But the idea is just to grind up a slow and steady growth and weÃ¢ÂÂre starting to see that come through and largely it was massed in Ã¢ÂÂ14-Ã¢ÂÂ15 and behind that those areas, because we are divesting a lot non-core relationships and now we have synergy one and we have the core card business we wanted.
Do you think you can continue to hold does not improve the ROE as capital will likely continue to grow, presuming that you still will get those benefits going forward, and you are not at the point of returning more than 100% of your earnings yet?
ItÃ¢ÂÂs the core deposit account, the core credit card and getting it used in the core mortgage and the core home equity and the core auto loans thatÃ¢ÂÂs what weÃ¢ÂÂve been driving at and we continue to drive that and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the backbone of what we did and how we reposition this company over many years.
And the way to think about that optimization and why it is extremely important business to the company is that weÃ¢ÂÂve gone from 300 basis points the cost of all that to deposits to about 150 over the last 6-7 years and thatÃ¢ÂÂs by continuing to optimize the physical plan as well as all these other means.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre continuing to see good growth in consumer vehicle lending the way that we run the business.
You referenced some of the strategies you have in place driving responsible growth, and how you felt good about the business going forward.
Look I want to take just one step back, because to really answer that question you just have to have a better appreciation for how we run Bank of America, and it truly really does start with our purpose which is to help customers better live their financial lives and from there you have to understand what we mean responsible growth.
And if you look at the BRASS tax financials in to the third quarter of Ã¢ÂÂ16 we had $4.4 billion of revenue in our wealth management business.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre always the managing the trade-off between sort of liquidity, capital in terms of interest rate movements and returns and we just deployed some of that as I said in US treasuries because you can think about it going from one part of the government to the other.
And again I want to point out, weÃ¢ÂÂve done a lot of thinking about that, and we think maybe there is a near term impact on earnings but long term we think thatÃ¢ÂÂs a better strategy for our shareholders given the risk profile of the mortgages that were originating putting on the balance sheet.
And so weÃ¢ÂÂre earning all our money on the 7% and so when you think about the weighted average of that, it comes out over 10 and that means that youÃ¢ÂÂre in a lot more on the seven even across the whole company, and so thatÃ¢ÂÂs one of the difficulties.
Again less customers so the leverage is not quite the same and thatÃ¢ÂÂs why we spend a lot of our time around the consumer, and thereÃ¢ÂÂs just less leverage and the advisor you have to think about that business because the advisors are core strength that we have to the customer that we have to have an execution which is universal between the advisors and the customers, they can all see the same thing.

boa,q4,2016,"In improving economy, a relentless focus on client selection and growth through responsible lending combined to result in a historical low charge-off rate of 39 basis points for our company this quarter.
Consumer banking, our biggest earning business, continued its strong performance through its transformation, produced more than $7 billion in after-tax earnings, growing 8%.
Our global banking business serving our commercial customers continued to produce strong revenue and generated $5.7 billion of earnings.
And lastly, but not leastly, our global markets business earned $3.8 billion, the most itÃ¢ÂÂs earned in the past 5 years, with a rebound in sales and trading revenue and strong expense discipline on the part of the team.
As you know and you can see from the slides Paul walked through later, our business has important leadership positions across the board in their industry and we believe that they have room to grow their market shares by focus on deepening relationships with their existing customers as well as winning customers from the competition.
Turning to Slide 4, let me cover a few highlights in the fourth quarter before I turn it over to Paul, reported earnings of $4.7 billion after-tax at $0.40 per diluted share and EPS improvement of 48% from the year ago quarter on a reported basis.
We had a couple of pennies and net benefit this quarter from resolutions and tax matters that were partially offset by the combination of smaller charges for revenue, for debt hedge ineffectiveness, additions to our UK card ppi reserves we prepared for sale and DVA.
And with loan and deposit growth, we would expect NII to continue to improve from there throughout 2017 and beyond and Paul will take you through these numbers in a minute.
Their questions have ranged from corporate tax reform and what do we think about that, regulatory changes, economic growth and the impacts of these things and interest rate changes.
Again, the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year lower operating expenses and we have room to move them lower even as we continue a healthy investment across all our businesses.
Overall, the end of period assets declined $8 billion from Q3 as solid loan growth across our business segments was more than offset by lower levels of trading assets in our global markets business.
Driving the decline was a $4.7 billion reduction in the value of AFA securities held in our investment portfolio, which reduced in value as long-term rates rose significantly during the quarter.
Benefiting ratio was a $12 billion decline in RWA driven by lower exposures in our global markets business, partially offset by loan growth.
Turning to Slide 6, on an average basis, total loans are up $22 billion or 3% in Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15, versus Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ16 we saw pick up in growth driven by holiday spending on credit cards and some late quarter growth in commercial activity.
And on the bottom right chart, note the $64 billion in year-over-year growth in average deposits that Brian mentioned.
As you think about Q1 Ã¢ÂÂ17 versus Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ16, the benefit from the absence of negative market related ineffectiveness will be offset by two less days in the quarter, so you can effectively take this quarterÃ¢ÂÂs NII as a starting point.
Now assuming interest rates remain at current levels and we see modest loan and deposit growth, we believe we will earn approximately $600 million in additional NII in Q1, primarily driven by the Q4 rate increases in both the long and short end.
This business is generating above average deposit growth, solid loan growth, improving customer satisfaction and strong growth in earnings.
Consumer banking earned $1.9 billion and produced a 22% return on allocated capital this quarter.
Looking a little closer at revenue Ã¢ÂÂ excuse me, looking a little closer at the revenue drivers compared to Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15, while we report NII and non-interest revenue separately, it is important to emphasize again that our strategy is to focus on relationship deepening and growing total revenue, while improving operating leverage through expense discipline.
Average deposits continued their strong growth, up $54 billion or 10% year-over-year outpacing the industry.
Focusing on client balances on the left, in addition to deposit growth, client brokerage assets at $145 billion are up 18% versus Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15 on strong account flows and market valuations.
Turning to Slide 14, global wealth and investment management produced earnings of $634 million, which is up modestly from Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15 on solid operating leverage.
Relative to Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ16, we saw a pickup in lending, with average loans on a year-over-year basis up $19 billion or 6%.
Global markets earned $658 million and returned 7% on allocated capital in what is typically the most seasonally challenged quarter of the year.
For the year, the return on allocated capital was 10%, as sales and trading revenue ex-DVA grew 5%, while expense declined.
Paul, I was wondering if you could give us a little more split, some of the drivers of the net interest income increase that you are expecting to recur between the fourth and first quarter, the $600 million, how much is that is driven by the Fed hike we saw on the short end and how much of it might be the long end in rates versus loan growth?
Let me Ã¢ÂÂ maybe the simplest way to sort of answer that question would be to take you back to 9/30, right, when the inter-sensitivity on the long end was $2.1 billion.
In terms of next year, we will see what the scenarios are, the dollar caveats, but you are seen us constantly move our numbers up and we will continue to do that in our Ã¢ÂÂ our cushions and stuff are strong on the earnings, but the most important thing for us was kind of getting to make sure the earnings power of the company kept coming back and now with $17 billion earnings, we feel confident we will be able to push forward.
So when we think about going forward, what kind of deposit betas you are assuming in that $600 million per quarter and how do we think about the next rate hike, say we get one in June, which seems to be consensus, do you still expect to have very low positive betas from there?
And then the question on mortgage was, the production was good, but the pipeline fell a lot, obviously, a function of what happened in rates, but can you help us to think about what to expect, say, next year if say rates go up along the forward yield curve?
And so our view Ã¢ÂÂ the team would tell me that the pipeline will be down, because refinances are down and therefore expect less, but I think my view is that they should be able to continue to grow market share frankly because of the capacity that they were able to develop this year given those changes and still produce well.
So, we have told you, think about the mortgage banking income line as $300 odd million is a little higher this quarter just because some of the dynamics.
So, we are not Ã¢ÂÂ we feel great about it, but Ã¢ÂÂ and we think there is lots of opportunity and we would expect continued performance in that business.
But my guess is we are Ã¢ÂÂ our stress capital buffer is below the minimum that would be required, so we feel like we are in a good position for CCAR Ã¢ÂÂ17.
Deposits come in, thatÃ¢ÂÂs what really drives the size of the balance sheet, deposits come in, and the question is, within our risk framework, can we put those deposits to work with our customers and clients around the world?
And we Ã¢ÂÂ the duration of what we do on treasuries will be a little bit based on where we think rates are going and stuff like that, but itÃ¢ÂÂs driven Ã¢ÂÂ it just it goes in those two things because we have Ã¢ÂÂ once we fund the loan balance, thatÃ¢ÂÂs where it goes.
Other question was just on the improvement in the minimum capital ratio and the RWA reduction that drove that, could you just give us a little more color on the drivers there and do you feel like you are optimized now for what you want to take in terms of risk relative to total size balance sheet?
When you think about rate sensitivity in deposit betas, you get back to really deposit flows, we continued to see increases in deposit balances and until we see any pressure of those balances being kind of deployed back into the economy, there really shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be much impact on pricing, what is Ã¢ÂÂ you are looking at the core deposit balances and kind of what are the flows you are seeing and where is that growth coming from and are you seeing any pressure in a sense of thinking of those balances being deployed back into the economy?
In terms of deployment economy, we made $20 billion more loans, And we will continue to drive the economy and we can will invest in mortgage backed securities and things like that, so we are able to fund easily all the loan demand that we think is responsible to take on.
And loan growth in the middle market business was strong in the fourth quarter and we are looking forward for more of that in our small business.
Last quarter, we had I think some Ã¢ÂÂ that line is going to bounce around a little bit, let me start with that.
So there is certainly a lot of positives on this call, whether its deposits, loans, expenses, etcetera, but the end result, itÃ¢ÂÂs still a single digit return on equity, a return on tangible common equity and I know you wanted to be higher, I know itÃ¢ÂÂs improved, but itÃ¢ÂÂs still below your peers today at 13% and below your target of 10%, so can you give us a target metric for RoTCE for 2017 or when do you think you get to that double-digit range where some of your peers are?
And so just if you think about the middle-market business, as I said earlier, the revolver utilization is on the high end of where itÃ¢ÂÂs been the past several years at 40% plus in a Ã¢ÂÂ that group, which is our middle-market business, a commercial real estate business, etcetera, at about $4 billion with loans in quarter four, so all that really relates to greater business confidence.
Paul, just to think about that a second, that credit quality mortgages is so strong that frankly itÃ¢ÂÂs not worth getting the guarantees and things like that, we have the liquidity to fund them and itÃ¢ÂÂs obviously jumbos, but even on conforming, the credit quality of ours is at the top end and I think the charge-off ratio was 3 basis points in the fourth quarter.
No, thatÃ¢ÂÂs good question, but itÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ we transferred servicing at the end of the quarter.
So we feel very good about the growth in deposits year-over-year, 12% in checking and 10% overall, so itÃ¢ÂÂs coming from somewhere, I just donÃ¢ÂÂt know where exactly.
And then the other number thatÃ¢ÂÂs important is, at year end, our DTAs that would be re-priced if the tax rate changed equaled approximately $7 billion.
Before I turn the call over to Brian and Paul, let me remind you we may make some forward-looking statements.
We lowered our costs to improve productivity, with result in reduction expenses by almost 5% compared to 2015.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs nearly $3 billion in expense reductions continuing a long-term trend.
Note that this quarter had lower levels of non-core gains from equity, debt and asset sales than in past years.
Provision expense was modestly lower in the aggregate from fourth quarter Ã¢ÂÂ15 as our responsible growth strategy resulted in a 23% improvement in net charge-offs and we also had a lower amount of net reserves release from last yearÃ¢ÂÂs fourth quarter.
As these rate increases were late in the quarter, they didnÃ¢ÂÂt benefit the fourth quarter NII number thatÃ¢ÂÂs significant, but we look forward to first quarter Ã¢ÂÂ17 when we expect NII to all things remaining equal by approximately $600 million per quarter despite having 2 less days in that first quarter.
This dynamic bodes well as we expect growth and earnings from productivity improvements will now get the added benefits of rate increases.
Credit quality metrics remained strong, perhaps best symbolized by our net charge-off ratio which hit a record low of 39 basis points this quarter.
Our strong credit quality metrics are a manifestation of our overall risk management which has been transformed since 2008 and we expect our performance to bode well as we move through economic cycle.
Turning quickly to Slide 9, net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was 10.3 Ã¢ÂÂ $10.5 billion on an FTE basis.
Compared to Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15, NII this quarter was relatively stable after adding back the $612 million charge we incurred last year when we called some troughs securities.
Partially offsetting these benefits was market based hedge and effectiveness totaling $169 million related to the accounting for our long-term debt and associated swaps where we have swapped interest payments from fix to floating.
With respect to asset sensitivity as at 12/31 and instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates, it is estimated to increase NII by $3.4 billion over the subsequent 12 months.
Consumer continued to lower expenses and the efficiency ratio dropped nearly 500 basis points to 53% from Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15.
With good pricing discipline, prepaid on deposits remained a steady 4 basis points and the operating cost of deposits was also steady at 160 basis points.
Our relationship deepening is improving NII and balanced growth, while holding the fee line flat as we reward customers for doing more business with us.
However, the industry trend of increasing reward costs continues to mitigate our overall card revenue growth.
Turning to expenses in the upper right, they declined 7% in Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15 despite higher FDIC assessment charges between the two periods.
Loan growth reflected total consumer real estate production of $22 billion, up 29% from Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15 and 7% higher than Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ16 as the prior quarterÃ¢ÂÂs pipeline came through.
While these trends were important and continued to transform how consumers interact with us, I would remind you that we still have nearly 1 million people a day walking into our financial centers across the U.S. Many of these customers still use our branches to transact, but many also use the branch as a financial destination where they can learn more about products and services, work face-to-face with a specialized professional and generally improve their financial lives.
Year-over-year, non-interest income declined $104 million as higher asset management fees were more than offset by lower transactional revenue.
A 4% decline year-over-year on expenses drove 170 basis point improvement in operating leverage from Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ15.
Other declines were the result of work across many categories of expense more than offsetting higher litigation and FDIC costs compared to last year.
Client balances climbed over Ã¢ÂÂ they climbed to $2.5 trillion driven by market values, solid long-term AUM flows, and continued loan and deposit growth.
Global banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, continued stabilization in oil prices and improvement in exposures drove provision expense lower in Q4 Ã¢ÂÂ16.
Continued expense discipline drove costs 10% lower year-over-year, led by reductions in operating and support costs.
Given the increase in rates and our progress with respect to reducing non-core assets, this quarterÃ¢ÂÂs results are more reflective of future trends with respect to these two line items.
Yes. That leaves Bank of America standing out quite a bit on the low end of payouts versus peers, so I am kind of wondering Ã¢ÂÂ two questions, one how do you guys think about that de minimis, you did well in 2016, any reason that Bank of America couldnÃ¢ÂÂt think about the de minimis top off or their restrictions on that or could you do that at some point this year on the de minimis.
Yes. ItÃ¢ÂÂs definitely moving up as we get more short-term rate hikes.
Our next question is from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
Our next question is from Matt OÃ¢ÂÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
So even if revenue is better than expected, but itÃ¢ÂÂs rate-driven, thatÃ¢ÂÂs not going to impact expenses materially?

boa,q1,2017,"Good day, everyone and welcome to todayÃ¢ÂÂs Bank of America First Quarter Earnings Announcement Conference Call.
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter results.
We did that in quarter one despite $1.4 billion of annual retirement-eligible incentives and seasonally elevated payroll tax costs.
We saw $29 billion in long-term asset under management flows this quarter within our wealth management business.
Total net charge-offs of $934 million or 42 basis points on average loans increased slightly from Q4 due to expected seasonality in our credit card products but were down 13% from Q1 2016.
Note that Q1 2016 included a significant increase in reserves and global banking for energy exposures that was mostly offset by releases in consumer reserves in that quarter.
Our reserve coverage ratios -- excuse me, our reserve coverage remained strong with an allowance to loan ratio of 125 basis points and coverage level three times our annualized charge-offs.
Now, as Brian mentioned, we remain disciplined around deposit pricing given the investment we have made and customer relationships through preferred rewards and other deepening activities.
Non-interest income included improvements in service charges and a small increase in card income that was more than offset by decline in mortgage banking income.
Consumer banking credit quality remained solid with the net charge-off ratio declining 4 basis points to 121 basis points.
Also, note that our relationship deepening is improving NII and balance growth while holding fee line flat as we reward customers for doing more business with us.
We also believe these deposit accounts offer clients significant value in terms of transparency, convenience and safety, which also means theyÃ¢ÂÂre less likely to move their relationships.
This quarter also included the successful rollout of Merrill Edge guided investing for clients who want some advice from our CAO office but donÃ¢ÂÂt desire a fully advised relationship.
LetÃ¢ÂÂs review global wealth and investment management which produced earnings of $770 million and record pre-tax offering margin of 27%, while returning 22% on allocated capital.
Client balances climbed to nearly $2.6 trillion driven by market values, solid long-term AUM flows, and continued loan growth.
Global banking continues to drive loan growth within its risk and client frameworks, albeit at a slower pace.
The only other thing worth pointing out here is a reminder that this is where we book the annual retirement-eligible incentive and elevated Q1 payroll tax before they get allocated out to the line of business throughout the year.
Asset quality remains strong and net charge-offs low.
I hope you noted that if one allocates annual retirement-eligible incentives and seasonally payroll elevated tax throughout the year, we are basically at our return targets this quarter.
[Operator Instructions] And weÃ¢ÂÂll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre adding new accounts; we had 1.2 million cards this quarter.
Brian, when you look out longer term and if you turn back the clock when the industry before the financial crisis typically earned a 120 on assets, 130 basis points on assets and a more normal interest rate environment.
And then most importantly, was brining expense structure down dramatically five or six years ago, Tom and the team did by almost $1 billion in quarter in operating expense of markets business alone and then maintaining it there and continuing to push it down where revenues have stabilized and come back up.
I mean, obviously one thing thatÃ¢ÂÂs has been helpful for returns in banking is very benign credit environment, commercial charge-offs with 10 basis points this quarter.
And weÃ¢ÂÂll take our next question from Matt OÃ¢ÂÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
Yes. I would say, weÃ¢ÂÂre in a little bit more positive place right now, where -- even where rates are having long-term rates have gone up here over the last two quarters.
This quarter, we produced strong revenue growth; we drove cost savings that offset higher revenue related cost; and we managed risk well; and we returned more capital to you, our shareholders through dividends and increased repurchased shares than any period since the crisis.
Those earnings were up 40% compared to the first quarter of last year, driven by 700 basis points of operating leverage.
On a year-over-year basis, our average deposits were up $58 billion, average loans were up $21 billion, and sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were up 23% with better client activity.
These figures reflect solid progress in this quarter against our long-term targets, but are even closer, if you were to allocate the seasonal aspects of the retirement-eligible compensation costs and elevated payroll tax expenses, across the years, just opposed to putting it all in the first quarter.
Even though the quarter one is typically a good capital markets quarter for us, if you just spread those costs, youÃ¢ÂÂll see that across all the quarters, the metrics this quarter would then reflect an efficiency ratio of near 62%, return on assets nearly 100 basis points and return on tangible common equity of 12%.
On slide four, as I mentioned, the key to profitability in this environment is to drive good core customer growth and revenue while controlling our costs to drive operating leverage.
This quarter, you can see on the slide four better revenue growth on year-over-year base across each of our business segments.
Our global banking business produced a record revenue quarter, led by a strong investment banking results and that generated $1.7 billion in after-tax earnings.
Lastly, our global markets business earned $1.3 billion in after-tax earnings, generating a 15% return on its allocated capital.
Our other category shows a loss, driven mostly by the $1 billion in first quarter of FAS 123 cost and related personnel taxes, which gets allocated across the business segments throughout the year.
But the reduction in losses year-over-year was driven by improved operating costs in the Company and lower litigation expense.
While many of you might focus on rates and our leverage to rising rates, note that the $1.5 billion in year-over-year revenue growth is split 40% for NII which is driven by rate and by also the growth in loan and deposit balances, and the other 60% was driven through non-interest revenue.
Our rates paid has remained steady at 9 basis points on deposits while at the same time we have grown those deposits, 5% year-over-year or $58 billion.
On lending activity, weÃ¢ÂÂve been in a lot of discussion regarding a slowdown and our core middle market business representing the broad base of American companies, our business loans grew 7% year-over-year and our smaller business segments business banking and small business were up 3% and small business had the best production quarter in its history.
First, we saw higher trading-related assets in global markets business with incremental customer activity following a seasonal slowdown at the end of Q4; secondly, we had higher cash levels, driven by seasonal deposit growth, primarily from tax refunds.
Global liquidity sources increased in the quarter, driven by higher deposit flows and bank funding.
The ratio also benefited from an $11 billion -- excuse me, a $14 billion decline in RWA, driven by lower exposure in our global markets business, lower card exposure and legacy asset runoff.
We think these growth rates are responsible given the economy grew around 2% year-over-year.
On the bottom of the chart, note the $58 billion, 5% year-over-year growth in average deposits, which is driven by 10% growth in consumer banking.
The stability of our asset quality and loss trends reflects many years now of disciplined client selection and strong underwriting practices that are foundational to our responsible growth and through-the-cycle performance.
As of 3/31, an instantaneous 100 basis-point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $3.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months, which is consistent with our position at year-end.
Given a one month LIBOR rise of about 25 basis points with the March hike and the long-end down, we should focus on the $2.5 billion short-end benefit; dividing that by four, get you a quarterly run rate of roughly $600 million for a 100 basis-point shock; assuming itÃ¢ÂÂs only 25 basis points instead of a 100 would get you to approximately $150 million benefit in the quarter.
From there, we would expect continued modest growth in NII in the second half of 2017, assuming modest growth in loans and deposits and rates at least above where they are today.
Our Company-wide simplification efforts and the $110 million in lower litigation costs offset a number of higher expenses year-over-year, including $150 million of higher incentives for annual retirement-eligible employees and seasonally elevated payroll taxes; $190 million of higher incentives associated with revenue growth across wealth management, global banking and global markets, and $160 million of higher expenses due to changes in our share price with respect to accounting from employee stock based awards.
This segment produced $1.9 billion earnings, growing 7% year-over-year and returning 21% on allocated capital.
Note that that 21% return is on $37 billion of allocated capital, which is an increase of $3 billion this quarter, given growth in their loans and deposits.
First, as usual in the upper left, the statutory reminder of our strong competitive position; second, as we point out each quarter, while we report NII and non-interest income separately, our strategy remains focused on relationship deepening and growing total revenue while improving operating leverage through expense discipline.
Average deposits continued their strong growth, up $57 billion or 10% year-over-year, outpacing the industry.
Focusing on client balances on the bottom left, you can see the success we continue to have growing deposits, loans and brokerage assets.
Also note the $29 billion of long-term AUM flows this quarter reflecting strong client activity, as well as the continuing shift from IRA brokerage to AUM.
Revenue growth coupled with expense management, improved the efficiency ratio 500 basis points to 44%.
This quarter shows the value of our businesses as rates begin to rise and as we experience increased capital markets activity.
For years, we have stayed focused on growing responsibly, including staying within our risk and client frameworks and making our growth more sustainable by simplifying the Company and improving efficiency.
We created operating leverage in each of our business segments, and we returned more capital to shareholders than in any quarter since the financial crisis.
So, if you look at it overall, weÃ¢ÂÂve been able to outgrow the economy, but weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be dependent upon, the economy keep growing, but what weÃ¢ÂÂre showing across last couple of years with the discipline we have, driving deeper penetration or customers working hard on our relationships, even with repositioning portfolios, you can see in some of the slides and/or making sure that we maintain great discipline, weÃ¢ÂÂve been able to grow the mid single digits as weÃ¢ÂÂve told you against the backdrop of economy growing 1.5% to 2%.
Separate question on capital, with the CET1 at 11% now versus the 2019 requirement of 9.5%, what kind of buffers are you thinking of holding and what level of CET1 feels like the right target for you longer term?
I think the way for you Steve to think about is look at the global markets year-over-year and what you see there is with that substantial rise in revenue, the expense growth absent, last year we had a credit and litigation issue, we had an expense, so you had a pretty good reversal there; absent that, it was 2% growth and as Paul said, had 6% less people.
I think we have been building our capital year-over-year, and you should expect us to continue to do that since we have both the strong cushion under CCAR.
So, on the consumer fee side, I wanted to just ask, we saw kind of a little bit of a positive turn in both card income and also in the brokers line, which is the first time in a while weÃ¢ÂÂve seen both of those move the right way.
But as you point out, the card income line remains I think in terms of growth, remains muted by competition around customer rewards.
I think Gerard this is the focus weÃ¢ÂÂve talked to you about getting above 100 basis points and with the adjustments of sort of smoothing out the first quarter little bit from the one time, annual expenses occur in the first quarter, youÃ¢ÂÂre getting close to that.
Our performance in global markets is going to be a direct result of client activity as we say every quarter.
I think if you look at our disclosures, youÃ¢ÂÂll see that the 100 basis-point rate shock at the end of the year was basically the same as it is right now.
Revenue growth of 7%, flat expenses, 700 basis points of operating leverage across our franchise, good client growth in each of the business and our asset quality remains strong.
",48.47,0.931763
boa,q2,2017,"As we look at the next slide on first half line of business results, I'm going to let Paul talk about the details of the quarter in a minute but I wanted to highlight basically two things.
First, momentum in the businesses has comparing the first half of this year versus the first half of last year, and second, a focus a bit on our Consumer business as it reached $2 billion in after tax earnings this quarter.
Consumer banking produced $3.9 billion in after tax earnings for the first half of the year growing 14% from 2016.
Our Global Wealth and Investment Management business recorded first half earnings of $1.6 billion, up 9% year-over-year with a 27% profit margin.
And finally, when you look at our Global Markets business, they're in $2.1 billion in the first half and generated 12% return on its capital.
So given the $2 billion earnings milestone, I want to talk about and focus on the multi-year effort this business is going through.
As you can see also from the crisis forward, we had focused on underwriting prime and super-prime customers and you can see that in the change in total net charge offs that occurred prior to 2014 and it remains in good stead over the last four years.
Today's business operate to the 52% efficiency ratio and with continuing to drive the customer behavior changes, continued investments for further cost improvements, we expect that to go lower.
So for the end of the day, our consumer business is an example of drive responsible growth, growing with no excuses, doing it on a right way the customer, doing it and managing risk well and importantly doing on a sustainable investment basis investing in the future or producing great returns in the current.
First, we completed the sale of our U.K. consumer card business during the quarter resulting in a small after-tax gain.
Overall, end-of-period assets increased a modest $7 billion from Q1 despite the sale of assets totaling $11 billion associated with the U.K. card business.
When looking at deposits on a year-over-year basis, they are up $47 billion or 4% from Q2 2016 driven entirely by our consumer banking business.
Loans on end-of-period basis were up $11 million from Q1 as broad based growth across consumer and commercial loans was modestly offset by the run off of legacy non-core loans.
This increase was driven by $4.9 billion of net income available to common and improved OCI of $700 million offset by common dividend and net share repurchases totaling $2.8 billion in the quarter.
Compared to Q1 2017 NII was relatively flat, as the benefit from an increase in short-end rates was offset by a number of factors, including lower long-end rates in the quarter.
And third, going forward, we will also feel the effects of the full quarter loss of interest income from U.K. card equating to about $225 million.
With respect to asset sensitivity, as of 6/30, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by $3.2 billion over the subsequent 12 months, which is broadly in line with our position at the end of the first quarter and continues to be predominantly driven by our sensitivity to short-end rates.
We feel good about our expense progress this quarter, especially in light of our continued investments in sales professionals and new technology.
Average deposits grew 9%, and Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew 21%, improvement in NII drove the 9% revenue growth, which was driven by an increase in the value of deposits given the rise insurance rates as well as solid loan growth.
Turning to Slide 15, let's review a global wealth and investment management, which produce record earnings of $804 million, a pre-tax margin of 28% and a return on allocated capital of 23%.
We saw $28 billion of AUM inflow this quarter, continuing the strength of $29 billion in Q1, net interest income rose 14%, driven by an increase in the value of deposits given the rising short-term rates as well as an increase in loans.
A number of results to note, given the strong performance, record revenue in the quarter, record advisory fees, record first half revenue and net income, and year-to-date, we remain ranked number three in investment banking with fees of $3.1 billion.
Looking at trends on Slide 18 and comparing to Q2 last year, average loans were up $11 billion or 3% with the exception of CRE, loan growth was fairly broad based with C&I loans, up 5% in middle market lending.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.1%, which includes approximately $700 million of tax expense recorded in conjunction with the sale of U.K. card.
Importantly, we continue to invest in new technology and capabilities, while adding sales professionals in certain businesses and we significantly increase the amount of capital we returned to shareholders and announce plans to increase that even more.
These results tell us the responsible growth is working and that we are well positioned to continue to invest in and grow with our customers and clients as the economy continues to improve.
And the tagalong for net interest income guidance is, as you mentioned, very low deposit beta on the consumer side, just two basis points up in the quarter.
So we think we made pretty good progress year-over-year and we just have to continue to make that type of progress over the next few quarters and we'll get there.
Over the past several quarters, we used to have the major drops as we get a position, but it's going to have been $100 million-ish year-over-year step-down from the prior year, and so you'll see that kind of play out, we think.
And so that's what plays your benefit here because in the end of the day as rates continue to rise, if they continue to rise, the value of the consumer deposit franchise as being around this industry for a long time is going to be driven by the advantage and the checking balances and then some of the other balances will help, but there will be more rate sensitive.
So the question is how do you gain share and what you see is if you think about it year-over-year our Consumer Business grew about $60 billion and deposits around about half of that was in checking account balances, one half of that.
And so as you think about it that's what's going to drive a lot of deposits value and if you look at some of the rates and volumes charts, even you get to be interesting things, we look at the corporation overall, year-over-year our deposit costs on interest-bearing not non-interest-bearing up $100 million, 60 of that was in the U.S. and 40 of it is on 10% the interest-bearing deposits outside the U.S. So we feel good about the franchise and where we need to price because it's more investment orient say in the GWIM business.
So just think about the future, next couple of quarters we've got seasonality, which is going to be all else equal for the years normal it's going to be lowering the net charge-off rate.
If you just want to focus in on the risk adjustment margin that's going to - I think perform well in line with the industry and probably just a little bit lower, but we're more focused on total revenue.
So we'll - think we'd have to down 15, 17 branches linked quarter, a 100 odd year-over-year, that'll continue to happen.
I'd say that you seen us manage it well and we would expect to continue to manage it well in the future but we're not going to get ahead of the customer and create any disruption to the growth we're seeing in the core channel.
So expect us to continue to work on optimization of balance sheet, really at the end of day, opening up the difference in our GAAP capital levels for lack of a better term in our regulatory cap levels so we're down RWA on advanced based down 30-odd billion this quarter.
If we go back and think about where we started the quarter, where we ended it, we took out about half of what we thought to increase was going to be due to the card.
If you want to build any models, but on the revenue side, it's primarily interest income, think about $10 billion of receivables at 9%, plus you got a little small amount of card income I think that was around 30 million in the second quarter.
If you look in our supplement, you can see I think the net charge-offs ratios it's been running a little bit less than 2% call it $40 million, $45 million per quarter.
Just look at back up the first half of the year we think about the rate environment it's really changed on the short-end just to give you sense how it works, we've got $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion pick up in first half NII versus last year.
Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Bank of America 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Announcement.
That mantra drives the way we manage our cost effectively while at the same time making continued large investments in people and technology for the long term value of this franchise.
Year-over-year net interest income improvement of nearly $900 million drove revenue growth proving the value of this deposit-rich franchise.
We continued also to make progress on our returns and our return on tangible common equity moved above 11%, the first time despite increasing capital levels.
This was achieved with good revenue improvement in controlling costs and driving operating leverage while maintaining great credit quality.
Our Global Banking business serving commercial customers and commercial lending Treasury Services investment banking produced first half profits of $3.5 billion after tax.
Earnings up 36% from last year with strong operating leverage on operating basis and lower credit costs.
This quarter for example, this year we've rolled out our cash for customer interface for mobile devices making that cash management services more convenient for our clients.
Also you can see our expenses in a lower right hand side continue to drive tremendous operating leverage leading to that net income growth.
These increases in assets were offset by a decline in cash driven by seasonal deposit outflows associate with tax payments and a shift from deposits to a AUM brokerage and our Wealth Management business.
CET1 increased $4.4 billion to $168.7 billion driven by earnings, utilization of differed tax assets and less goodwill deductions given the U.K. card sale.
The CET1 ratio also benefit from a $34 billion decline in RWA driven by continued optimization work including model improvements as well as the sale of U.K. card.
There was a lot of Capital Markets activity this quarter and this may have impacted more than usual loan growth among larger corporates as a number of funded bridge loans were paid-off and as borrowers substituted bonds for loans in a flattening curve environment.
As I have emphasized before the stability of our asset quality and loss trends reflects years of disciplined client selection and strengthened underwriting standards along with an improving economy.
Credit quality continues to be solid with net charge-offs, NPLs, delinquencies and reservable criticized exposure all improving from Q1.
Provision expense is $726 million declined $109 million from Q1 and was down $250 million from Q2 2016 driven by lower losses in consumer real estate and improvements across most of our Commercial portfolio particularly energy.
Our reserve coverage remained strong with an allowance to loans coverage ratio of 120 basis points and coverage level three times our annual net charge-offs.
NII is up 868 million or 9% driven by an improving spread between our asset yields and deposit pricing in an environment where both short-end rates and long-end rates increased.
The efficiency ratio hit our 60% target this quarter, improving 300 basis points year-over-year.
The business created 900 basis points of operating leverage holding expenses flat while growing revenue 9%.
Non-interest income included improvement in service charges and a small increase in card income that was more than offset by decline in mortgage banking income.
Through continued efforts to drive costs down, the efficiency ratio improved nearly 500 basis point to 52%.
Consumer Banking credit quality remained strong with a net charge-off ratio of 121 basis points.
Our strategy remains focused on relationship deepening and growing total revenue while improving operating leverage through expense discipline.
Also note that our relationship deepening preferred rewards program is improving NII and balance growth while holding fee line flat as we reward customers for doing more business with us.
Spending levels on debit and credit cards were up 6% year-over-year and new issuance of credit cards was a solid at $1.3 million, spending levels on cards drives revenue but are largely offset by rewards given back to customers.
The digitization efforts that Brian discussed earlier and other productivity improvements continue to drive expenses lower, expenses were stable compared to Q2 2016 despite strong revenue growth and increases in the FDIC assessment rate and charges.
Adjusting for the prior period gain, non-interesting income improved 5% as 10% higher asset management fees were partially offset by lower transactional revenue.
Client balances now exceed 2.6 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth.
Earnings increased 19% from Q2 '16 driven by good results across investment banking and treasury services.
Year-over-year revenue growth of 7% coupled with flat expenses drove operating leverage of 600 basis points.
Within debt capital markets we saw a solid increase in investment grade fees while leverage finance declined.
Sales and trading revenue of $3.4 billion excluding net DVA was down 9% from Q2 2016 finishing ahead of our mid-quarter expectations.
Equity sales in trading was up 3% percent year-over-year to $1.1 billion benefiting from growth in client financing activity offset by slower secondary market revenue.
Revenue here also includes to roughly $800 million pre-tax gain from the U.K. card transaction which was almost entirely offset by related tax expense recorded here as well.
A few summary points to wrap up, again this quarter we created operating leverage by managing expenses while improving revenue.
For years, we have been focused on growing responsibly including staying within our risk and client frameworks as well as simplifying the company to improve operational efficiency all aimed at making our growth more sustainable.
We had some questions come in on how you are thinking improvements there could help you given that it's not directly in the CCAR stress test.
So Brian, I appreciate the helpful commentary you've given on capital ratios and the continued effort to optimize your RWAs. Steven Chubak
",49.08,0.9131077
boa,q3,2017,"Response for growth is delivering for our customers and for you our shareholders with strong operating leverage, strong credit results, and strong expense management.
First if you look at this quarter compared to year ago revenue grew 1% on a reported basis.
If you look at what drives that revenue growth, average loans and business segments grew 6% year-over-year.
So that remains our focus, continue to drive growth, but on occasions where capital markets might be slower and might be less growth and revenue, we have to manage our expenses well.
The business is driving operating leverage as we optimize our delivery network continues to digitize the business and follow the customer's behavior and as it changes over time.
In our wealth management business the teams continue to do a good job and you see earnings were up 10% on a year-to-date basis.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 6, overall compared to June 30, end of period assets increased $29 billion, driven by strong deposit growth that funded an increase in loans to customers with the remainder invested in securities and cash.
Turning to Slide 7, on an average basis total loans increased to $918 billion, note that the sale of UK card, which was recorded in All Other impacted year-over-year comparison of average loans by $9.3 billion.
Loan growth continue to be dampened by the run-off of non-core consumer real estate loans and All Other, year-over-year loans in All Other including the sale of UK card were down 28 billion.
This growth was driven by consumer segments, deposits increasing by $53 billion or nearly 9% year-over-year.
With respect to consumer net charge-offs were down from Q2, included in the quarter were recoveries on the sale of some consumer real estate loans, partially offsetting this recovery benefit was the negative impact of clarifying guidance from the regulators on bankruptcies, which increased our consumer losses this quarter.
Compared to Q2 2017 NII increased 175 million as the benefits from an increase in short-end rates and an extra day of interest, as well as loan and deposit growth was mitigated by a number of factors.
Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on Slide 12, earnings were $2.1 billion growing 15% year-over-year and returning 22% on allocated capital.
Within revenue, mortgage banking income was the only major category that was lower year-over-year, driven by our strategy of holding more originations on balance sheet instead of selling to the agencies, as we like the economics of holding these high quality originations.
Focusing on client balances on the bottom left you can see the success we continue to have growing deposits, loans, and brokerage assets.
Our 9% year-over-year average deposit growth continued to outpace the industry, while the rate paid remained low and stable.
Turning to Slide 14, letÃ¢ÂÂs look again this quarter at digital banking highlights as they continue to shape the way we do business with our customers.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why we continue our multi-year branch refurbishment program, and it is also why we continue to add new financial centers in markets where we have never had a Bank of America Center, but we have a strong presence in other lines of business.
The increase in deposit rates at the end of the second quarter helped to mitigate the movement of client balances from deposits to other cash investment alternatives within AUM and brokerage.
As Brian mentioned, our loan growth in global banking has been pretty consistent over the past three or four quarters at 4% to 6% on a year-over-year basis.
While the quarter is down from Q3 2016 as you can see on the lower left box, sales and trading revenue has been fairly consistent on a year-to-date basis for the last three years at roughly $10.5 billion.
Again this quarter, we created positive operating leverage by growing revenue, while lowering expenses.
And as Brian pointed out, this continued a trend of many quarters of positive operating leverage.
We continue to invest in new technologies and capabilities, while adding sales professionals in certain businesses and we did all this on nearly doubling the amount of capital we returned to shareholders this year versus last year.
This tells us that responsible growth is working and that we are well positioned to continue to invest in and grow with our customers and clients as the economy continues to improve.
I think we have leadership position if thatÃ¢ÂÂs told just by other people and how they rate people in terms of activities and capabilities and things like that, but most importantly itÃ¢ÂÂs how your customers use you, and what you see going on.
We are excited about the Zelle payment levels because at the end of the day we have $5 billion that we spend a year on the cash currency, checks moving around our company and the system that the way we are going to get there is by coming, you know digitizing those and eliminating cash and driving that, and so things like Zelle, whether small numbers compared to all the other payment forms today the pace that they are growing at with the digital wallets and other things will help drive it there
2000 more salespeople, a lot of those in consumer, refurbishing all the branches, building out branches, and things like that because at the end of the day 20% odd of sales were on digital and mobile, but 80% arenÃ¢ÂÂt and because of the nature of the intimate customer discussions because of the nature of what customers want to discuss and have face-to-face help on the branches are critically important to that.
Think about the deposit growth year-over-year and consumer of 50 odd billion dollars and start to think about that in the context of activity.
We instituted - a year ago now, it is not longer, we pulled back a little bit on CRE, so we are still servicing customers there, we are still making loans, but weÃ¢ÂÂre not, we're just being a little bit more cautious, and so you're not seeing a lot of growth in our CRE balances.
But if you look at the different categories, you're going to see that most of the move is in the now Money Market, which is - that's where the Wealth Management business is, and then the $240 billion odd number in there, about $140 billion of it is really peopleÃ¢ÂÂs invested cash.
And so if we make an allocation like we did in the second quarter to less cash and more equities that actually brings deposits out and then people are obviously thinking as investment cash.
But if you think about it across a year, there's about a 75 basis point increase in Fed funds, and you start to put these numbers against and even Wealth Management is relatively modest in terms of the change in the overall.
The other thing that drives our profitability is, if you look at that page go down and you remember thatÃ¢ÂÂs non-interest bearing account, the deposits are still zero, and they grew - theyÃ¢ÂÂre $436 billion of non-interest bearing accounts.
And in terms of next year when you think about the $53 billion target doesn't look like you might need it.
In other words, over - IÃ¢ÂÂm not talking about next quarter, but over multiple years, when you continue to drive the revenue expense play here, because the 2 million of core transaction deposit account and getting it from $2,000 over the last 8, 10 years to $6,000 per account is a tremendous revenue lift by focusing primary accounts as the number of accounts actually fell by 10%.
The deposits to consumer just, Mike, which are more and small business, which are more related to your thing, weÃ¢ÂÂre actually up 9% year-over-year, not 4%, that's the overall incorporate level, including GWIM commercial.
And so they were able to shutdown some of the runoff as, Paul just described, but it's really localized in the GWIM business, and it's really driven by a subset of those deposits, which are in asset management accounts and in brokerage accounts that are part of an investment strategy that that is different than transactional checking accounts and things that are driving both in our commercial business and our consumer business.
So, if we get a 25 basis point rate hike in December, again, most of that will see in the first quarter, the benefit, and it's going to depend on what our customers need and want and what the competitive dynamic is.
We've been - look, we've been experiencing solid long growth in consumer and GWIM and in - on the wholesale side and global banking you saw that again this quarter.
And so if you think about our deposit growth and the size of our deposits relative to our loans, every quarter we grow deposits and we put as much of that to work as we can in loan growth and whatever doesn't go to loans and client growth goes into the investment portfolio or cash.
But if we continue to really push that with - itÃ¢ÂÂs almost $900 billion in deposits in our GWIM consumer businesses, which are tremendously valuable in terms of what drives this franchisers profit.
Yes, just a point I was getting at is, you're paying up a little bit on the deposit side in the Wealth Management business.
Yes, but I mean think about the all-in cost and itÃ¢ÂÂs still much - it's still very advantage, because a $600 million a quarter for the $1.2 trillion in deposits in total just think about that a second, and if you think that there's a lot of advantage in any yield curve.
So whatever metric and you can stun yourself with the opportunity, the number of customers who have their banking accounts that are in our Wealth Management business and other banks, hundreds of billions of dollars of bank deposit balances, loan balances, the amount of middle market investment banking goes to competitors from our middle market clients is 70%, 80% of their activity, which we should be capturing a lot more of.
But you've got to grow in a rational responsible basis, so and that's what's playing out in us this quarter relative to other people, I think.
If you get to the 53 billion whenever that is 18 or whenever you there around 18, you drive down your efficiency ratio even further to [indiscernible], so you are pretty close to, sort of, your competitors despite the fact that your business mix is one that has more wealth management and which has a higher efficiency ratio, so how should we think about your ability, the opportunity set to continue to drive positive operating leverage over a multi-year period and get your efficiency ratio down even further to the mid-to-low 50% range and I know itÃ¢ÂÂs a difficult question to answer, and it depends on a lot of things, but with technology and AI and cognitive computing and digitization and mobile banking, can we see efficiency ratios that maybe a few years ago we wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt have even thought for a bank like Bank of America.
As you think about Bank of America for the quarter three of 2017 itÃ¢ÂÂs pretty straightforward, responsible growth.
We have been and we will continue to open centers and markets where you have a strong commercial banking wealth management client base that lack financial centers due to historical issues.
In addition to the technology investments, we have added 2000 primary sales professionals over the past 12 months, whether relationship bankers, financial advisors, commercial and business leaders.
Revenue of $21.8 billion was 1% higher than Q3 2016 as NII improvement and higher asset management fees outpaced decline in sales and trading, and mortgage banking income.
Loans on an end of period basis were up $10.5 billion from Q2 led by commercial activity, while consumer loan growth was mitigated by the continued run-off of legacy non-core loans.
The CET1 ratio also benefited from a modest $3 billion decline in RWA as growth in loans and low RWA density assets was offset by continuing optimization of the balance sheet.
We also provide our capital metrics under the standardized approach RWA increased $15 billion from Q2, driven by loan growth, but increases in capital more than offset asset growth resulting in a CET1 ratio improvement of 20 basis points to 12.2%.Supplementary leverage ratios for both the parent and bank continued to exceed US regulatory minimums that don't take effect until 2018.
Consumer banking and wealth management both experienced solid loan growth of 8%.
Both businesses continue to see good growth in residential mortgages.
Consumer banking also saw growth in credit card and vehicle loans, originations of new home equity loans was solid, but overall loan growth continues to be outpaced by pay downs.
Average deposits declined year-over-year in our wealth management segment as clients sought alternatives for their cash within brokerage or AUM.
Turning to asset quality on Slide 8, credit quality continues to be solid with net charge-offs, NPLs and reservable criticized exposure all showing improvement from Q2.
Total net charge-offs were 900 million or 39 basis points of average loans decreasing modestly from Q2.
Our reserve coverage remained strong with an allowance to loan ratio of 116 basis points and a coverage level three times our annual charge-offs.
Compared to Q3 2016, which has the same day count and seasonal factors, NII is up 960 million or more than 9% driven by an improving spread between our asset yields and deposit pricing.
The full quarter effect of the sale of UK card negatively impacted the comparison focusing on net interest yield it improved 18 basis points from Q3 2016 to 2.36% after adjusting for the impact of UK card.
Second, we raised rates broadly across our wealth management business to offer clients a competitive deposit alternative to cash alternatives within brokerage and AUM.
Looking ahead to Q4, assuming no changes in interest rates, NII growth will be dependent on loan and deposit growth and pricing.
With respect to asset sensitivity as of 930 [ph] an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase NII by 3.2 billion over the subsequent 12 months.
Productivity improvements were driven by our focus on digitizing processes and lowering our cost to deliver for our customers.
Compared to Q3 2016, in addition to overall operating cost improvements we reduced personnel expense, which included costs associated with our UK card business, as well as non-personal expense, which included lower litigation expenses.
With respect to expenses, through continued efforts to drive operating leverage the efficiency ratio improved over 400 basis points to 51%.
Consumer banking credit quality reflected moderate seasoning and portfolio growth, which drove reserve build of 168 million in addition to the 800 million in net charge-offs.
Looking at revenue more broadly, we believe our relationship deepening prefers reward program is improving NII and balance growth, while mitigating industry pressures on fees as we reward customers for doing more business with us.
Expenses were up modestly compared to Q3 2016 despite strong revenue growth as optimization and digitalization savings were more than offset by investments and refurbishing branches and technology initiatives.
Also note on the bottom left the growth in mobile channel usage, this quarter we saw nearly 1.2 billion logins, which is up 19% versus Q3 2016 and more than 21% of all check deposit transactions are now done on mobile devices.
The market and client activity once again provided a tailwind for asset management fees, while at the same time transaction revenue continues to face headwinds as the industry evolves and adapts new fiduciary requirements, and the increasing adoption of passive investing.
Moving to Slide 16, we continue to see overall solid client engagement, capital balances rose to nearly 2.7 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth.
Average loans of $154 billion grew 8% year-over-year and reflect the continued trend of investment clients deepening their relationship with us.
Year-over-year revenue growth of 5% was driven by improved NII reflecting solid loan and deposit growth, compounded by rising short-term interest rates.
Revenue improvement coupled with lower expenses created operating leverage of 650 basis points and an efficiency ratio of 43%.
Excluding net DVA and versus Q3 2016 fixed sales and trading of 2.2 billion decreased 22% within fixed the decrease was driven by less favorable market conditions across credit products, especially mortgages combined with lower volatility in rates, products in the current quarter.
Equity sales and trading was up 2% year-over-year to a little less than a billion benefiting from growth in client financing activity, lower volatility also drove lower secondary market activity in equities.
Without this strength in diversity, one would have seen a lot more revenue volatility as client activity shifted from a product and market perspective over the last three years.
For years we have been focused on growing responsibly, while improving operating efficiency and making our growth more sustainable.
Asset quality remained strong as net charge-offs, NPLs, and commercial reserve-like criticized exposure all declined.
The activity grows faster, and I think you put it against any kind of mobile digital person out there, 1.2 [ph] billion customer interactions in the quarter shows you that people believe that it must be pretty good.
If you think about something like another global transaction service platform cash management, as people call it, there has always been this loss and revenue that you're fighting against when paper - which people pay us more to process turns to digital, we lose revenue, but we save expense at a faster rate.
And then consumer expense ratio 51% that - as you're getting more people onto your Zelle platform, et cetera, is there a line of sight to that going sub-50 at some point?
I think through both the revenue lift they get, as the rate structure rises and good expense management, weÃ¢ÂÂd expect that it should move down below 50 at some point.
We look at how the team works together and we deploy those people in units and between six - five or six core business of operating markets to make sure building markets.
If you think about the whole card business as we reshaped it over the last 10 years quite frankly has been a move to more and more relationship customers whose credit statistics are relatively consistent over time.
Maybe a quick question on rate sensitivity, it looks like it didn't change despite absorbing another rate hike this past quarter.

boa,q4,2017,"In fact, this is the twelfth straight quarter where we have had reported a positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis and you can see that on Slide 3 and we did it the right way.
In total, the tax line includes $1.9 billion aggregate expense with the multiple impacts of the Tax Act including the tax benefit of the charge for new energy investments that I just mentioned as well as the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities.
Expenses declined 1%, which included roughly $200 million with the shared success bonuses in late December that Brian mentioned, plus an acceleration of planned charitable contribution in late December as we looked to share some of the future tax savings with our teams and the communities we serve.
Note that the Q2 sales of UK cards, which was a quarter than all other, impacted the year-over-year comparisons of average loans by $9 billion.
This growth was driven by consumer banking which increased by a $48 billion or nearly 8% year-over-year.
Compared to Q3 2017, NII increased $300 million driven by loans, securities, and asset growth in global markets, as well as a run up of short-end rates in anticipation of the FED funds cut and the deferrals.
On a full year basis, earnings were $8.2 billion growing 14% over 2016 with operating leverage driving the efficiency ratio to 50% by the end of the year.
Net charge-offs increased $107 million from Q4 2016 as we continued to experience modest and expected seasoning of our credit card portfolio and loan growth.
Revenue grew 8%, while expenses were up only 1% as the business reduced overhead to offset increases in investments and we added more than 400 bankers over the past few years as we continue to deepen and expand local coverage in commercial and business banking.
Year-over-year, earnings were down by $238 million driven by lower sales in trading results, higher technology investment spending and provisions.
The second question I get is, there is our focus change and we run the company differently given a lower tax rate and end of day is no.
We will continue to drive operational excellence, lowering operational expenses as weÃ¢ÂÂve done for many quarters in a row and improving our competitiveness as we develop and invest in new products and services.
In the end, whether through increased investments, capital distributions or supporting our clients, all this will benefit the economy and shareholders and drive our activities consistently responsible growth.
Third question is, do we think that the impact of tax reform will affect loan growth.
The question that we have to look at, Betsy as you reference is, is there an amount of investment that we may accelerate some of the things we are doing especially around consumer business but across all the business to accelerate the branch build out and some of the cities thatÃ¢ÂÂs proven to be very successful that we are doing over five years you want to speed it up a little bit.
So, the debate is, is there some amount that youÃ¢ÂÂd invest to help accelerate growth whether it be along the dimensions that weÃ¢ÂÂve been doing and will just improve our ability to get them done and speed it up it would be modest I think, is the best way to say.
Yes, I think, we want to focus all of you across all the business operating leverage and they tend to Ã¢ÂÂ theyÃ¢ÂÂve shown good progress at the company as a whole and each of the businesses and consumer can continually get operating leverage.
So, as we continue to get customers to adapt these new and exciting technologies, weÃ¢ÂÂll see more operating leverage, but itÃ¢ÂÂs been Ã¢ÂÂ the team has done a great job there, and I think theyÃ¢ÂÂll continue to improve it.
And then just last question on the dividend payout ratio, realize that earnings up with the lower tax rate, do you expect youÃ¢ÂÂll keep that dividend payout ratio flat or how are you thinking about the dividend and then overall capital return?
Brian, thanks for the comments on expenses and how you are thinking about some of the tax impacts and maybe accelerating investments.
I think the Ã¢ÂÂ as we said before, the key is to drive operating leverage as Betsy referenced John and continue to drive across the businesses.
Couple things weÃ¢ÂÂve been clear that leave aside the discussion about the investment on proceeds of taxes, but basically the $53 billion was a rate that we could kind of sustain around i.e., continuing to invest in operational improvement over time and keeping it relatively flat.
And so, we had a pretty good dynamic going and the sole question is, do you want to invest a bit to speed up and that would just increase that number by a little Ã¢ÂÂ by a bit and then play over the next couple of years.
I always come back, John, and youÃ¢ÂÂve followed our company closely, we have Ã¢ÂÂ we will continue to have the same rigor around the way weÃ¢ÂÂd run the company just because the tax rate is lower doesnÃ¢ÂÂt change how we are going to do it.
The question is, we took a little bit of money and accelerate investments and kind of run through a couple of years and probably drop back off.
But it be very modest and a greater context lot of investments get capitalized with the near term P&L impacts differ but basically from a conceptual framework, we think we can run the company in the low $53 billion approximate $1 billion on a consistent basis over the next couple of years with a caveat that we may look to invest part of the tax savings on top of that and weÃ¢ÂÂll be very clear when we do that.
I think it is Ã¢ÂÂ mechanically there is some things to help us over the next couple years in terms of some stuff running that pushes this up.
But Ã¢ÂÂ and then just switching over to wealth management, couple little questions on like, number one is, where is all the growth coming from, meaning you noted the strong flows, curious whatÃ¢ÂÂs current versus new clients and you also noted advises are up 3%.
But all that said, we feel good about 2018 NII growth, it is just going to be solid as itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be back to basics on loans, growing deposits, managing deposit rate paid.
One, the pricing strategy in consumer has already driven the relationships and so, as we look at pricing tiers and how we do it and set by market, set by product, set by type of customer depth and relationship, the rewards programs, the reward deposit balance along with Ã¢ÂÂ rates on loans and other types of things.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs an integrated business and a lot of people focus on the one aspect of it and try to isolate it, but itÃ¢ÂÂs actually a very integrated business, but to give you a couple other things, what hold us down is if you look at the deposits year-over-year, and consumer up $47 billion, the checking which is always going to be very low, it was up $30 billion of the $47 billion or $29 billion of the $37 billion and CDs are down $4 billion again.
They are all prime, core transaction accounts of the household which means the pay checks coming in Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs whatÃ¢ÂÂs driving the overall structure of the business and weÃ¢ÂÂll continue to do so.
Well, I think, when you talk about technology, the consumer bank has benefited by a lot of technology spending across the lot of dimensions including the way we distribute the environment t the branches Ã¢ÂÂ use of tablet type technology in the branches to integrate the customers, better call center technology.
So, we will continue to drive that, but I think, yes, we have invested, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not necessary what weÃ¢ÂÂve done for this year, itÃ¢ÂÂs $1 billion we probably invested in mobile technology over the last five, six years to get us here that now we are taking advantage of it and as you know it comes out the Merrill Edge capabilities continue to be improved to helping that affluent Ã¢ÂÂ mass affluent America.
I think, year-over-year the consumer business grew $47 billion of organic deposit growth.
Pretty decent rate and you are seeing growth across, just wondering what your expectation is for loan growth are as you look out and in a bigger sense, any sense of just the movement in commercial and corporate America in terms of starting to think about investing more in their businesses?
But as you go forward, you benefit from the lower tax rate you sort of right size your efficiency, you get to the $53 billion and drive positive operating leverage from there.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ if we just drive this company the same way and it will come out to be higher now and we will see those levels and we expect to continue to see it.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been running it on a responsible growth with the four elements, got to grow no excuses, got it Ã¢ÂÂ do it with it on a customer focused organic basis, got to do it with the right risk and got to be sustainable along the best place for people to work drive share our success with communities and drive operational excellence.
So, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think itÃ¢ÂÂs a major change in our industry frankly $200 million a year share, we are getting 2 million volunteer hours, billions of dollars of building modern housing investment earnings and $1 billion plus out to the CDFIs, we can rattle off all the stuff $100 billion and half way through.
Marty, I think weÃ¢ÂÂve got to look to it, so, given the fourth quarter and the $13.3 billion expenses, there is about a $145 million, $150 million of a one-time $1000 bonus to people under $100,000 $150,000 in our company plus we accelerate the $50 million of charitable donations in the fourth quarter 2017.
We are growing $40 billion, $50 billion year-over-year loans growth at a more modest rate especially due to run-offs.
Can you share with us in the investment bank what the pipeline looks like at the end of the fourth quarter coming into 2018?
So, the ability to accelerate those investments are largely based on what we think we can do that will be modest in a sense that, even a step of fair increase and the margin is not a big number in the overall scheme of things at the $53 billion expense level.
We had a good 2017 and we look forward to a great 2018 and we can do that by driving responsible growth, delivering value for our customers and for you our shareholders and we continue to do that.
Full year revenue is up 5% excluding the Tax Act impact while expenses declined 1%.
Excluding the Tax Act impact, our return on tangible common equity was 11% and our return on average Ã¢ÂÂ return on assets was 93 basis points pushing close to our long-term targets.
We also lowered cost so we continued our investments in digital capabilities for security protection for our customers; we show in our online and mobile banking leadership rankings.
The remaining decline in equity was mostly result of the decline in OCI as increases in long-end rates decreased the value of our debt securities portfolio.
Tangible book value per share of $16.96 was modestly above Q4 2016 as earnings over the year including the Tax Act impact offset share repurchases and dividends, as well as the convergence of Berkshire preferred stocks to common shares.
Under the standardized approach where risk sensitivity is less, funded and unfunded loan growth across the businesses drove a $22 billion increase in RWA.
Consumer banking led with a 9% increase with solid growth across mortgage, credit cards and vehicle loans.
The net reserve release reflects continued improvement and our legacy consumer real estate and energy portfolios.
Our reserve coverage remains strong with an allowance to loan coverage ratio of 112 basis points and a coverage level of 2.6 times our full year net charge-offs.
The Consumer credit card net charge-off ratio increased to 2.78% as the portfolio continues its expected seasoning.
However, remember, NII growth up on an FTE basis is completely offset by higher tax expense resulting in no change in earnings.
We expect these benefits over the medium-term to drive efficiencies that will help us offset inflationary cost and potentially increases in investments.
Cost of deposits which reflects non-interest expense as a percent of average deposits increased modestly because of year-end discretionary actions mentioned earlier to share future tax savings with low pay employees and the communities we serve.
Looking at revenue more broadly, we believe our relationship deepening, Preferred Rewards program is improving NII and growth of balances and allowing cost savings.
Spending levels and the one-time partner rebate drove a 5% revenue increase in card income, which continues to be impacted by strong competition on the rewards front.
By the way, customer satisfaction in Consumer Banking reached an historic high with roughly 80% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 at a 10 point scale.
We process payments for customers valued at $669 billion in Q4, annualized, that equates to over $2.5 trillion per year and note the 10% growth of digital payments relative to non-digital ebb 1% as customers continue to migrate from cash and checks helping us improve efficiency and reduce risk.
Market appreciation and client flows were once again a tailwind for asset management fees offsetting modest spread compression, at the same time, brokerage revenue continued to face headwinds as volumes declined and mix shifted.
Client balances rose to $2.75 trillion driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth.
Average loans of $157 billion grew 7% year-over-year continuing the trend of clients deepening their relationship with us.
Returning to Q4 year-over-year comparisons, revenue growth of 10% was driven by improved NII reflecting solid loan and deposit growth compounded by rising short-term interest rates.
Growth of loans in Global Banking remains fairly consistent with past several quarters increasing 4% year-over-year.
The outlook for loan growth given tax reform remains to be seen, but optimum Ã¢ÂÂ optimism among our clients is high.
Looking at trends on Slide 16 and comparing to Q4 last year, with respect to average loans, growth of 4% was led by corporate borrowers, evenly balanced between domestic and international clients.
In Global Banking, loan spreads were down one basis point compared to Q3 2017 continuing the trend weÃ¢ÂÂve seen all year which modestly compressed spreads year-over-year by mid single-digits.
Equity sales and trading at just shy of $1 billion was stable year-over-year as growth in client financing activity offset declines in cash and derivatives trading given lower levels of volatility and client activity.
With respect to expenses, Q4 2017 was 5% higher than Q4 2016 as lower revenue-related incentive cost were more than offset by continued investments in technology.
However in the medium to long-term, more after tax cash flow came from real estate business and we will benefit by greater loan growth as those businesses invest those proceeds.
Another question we often get is this tax reform change or come into $53 billion goal for 2018.
I wanted to understand from your prepared remarks, you are saying that $53 billion, youÃ¢ÂÂve already met it and youÃ¢ÂÂll retain it for the full year or may change your outlook based on how the customer demand evolves with the tax plan and within that just wondering if you are expecting that youÃ¢ÂÂll be able to generate more operating leverage in particular in the consumer space given the groundwork youÃ¢ÂÂve laid in digital payments and the branch networks?
Okay, and then just for Paul, on the overdraft policy understanding the long-term franchise value of the new policy, trying to think about the near-term financial impact, is there any kind of pull through continuation or drag on deposit fees that might come from the new overdraft policy or is that impact maybe fully in the fourth quarter numbers yet?
We would expect provision to roughly match net charge-offs with reserve releases moderating over time as we continue to build allowance in support of loan growth, those releases are being driven by non-core consumer real estate and energy.
So most of the growth is coming through our advisor training platform which we consolidated between the work Ã¢ÂÂ the people who work in the branches and people who work in the Merrill offices brought into one day training, product training program again for effectiveness and we think that has great prospects.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs consistent I think with what we are seeing for low figure big peers, but just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of when they Ã¢ÂÂ start seeing little bit of upward pressure there and being the biggest deposit player as you might be one of the setters of the price there as we think about rates going forward.
Yes, I am not sure how helpful I am going to be to you, I would just make a couple of points that weÃ¢ÂÂve made many times and that the industry really hasnÃ¢ÂÂt seen on the retail side deposit rates increasing sort of much or at all on traditional accounts.
What we told you guys is we got to $53 billion for 2018 be relatively flat thereon absorbing 6% medical care cost increases raises and things like that and that comes through ability to continue to investment effectiveness and efficiency.
",51.55,0.7580002
boa,q1,2018,"Consumer led our deposit growth with an increase of 6%, or $38 billion in deposits year-over-year, a strong showing.
We reported credit charge-offs of $911 million, 40 basis points of average loans, lower than both the prior quarter and the prior year ago quarter.
In fact, we reported a net charge-off ratio below 50 basis points now for 13 of the last 16 quarters, thatÃ¢ÂÂs four years of relative consistency.
And while our markets balance sheet grew to support our clients, our value of risk remain stable year-over-year.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been able to again reduce quarterly operating expenses this quarter on a year-over-year basis.
Growth in earnings was driven by not only tax reform, but also operating leverage and continued strong asset quality, which is easily seen in our $8.4 billion pre-tax income, which was up 15% year-over-year.
Overall, compared to the end of Q4 end of period assets of $2.3 trillion increased $47 billion, driven by growth to support Global Markets clients, as well as higher cash balances from strong deposit growth.
The OCI decrease was driven by a $4 billion after-tax decline in the recorded value of our asset securities, given the increase in long-end rates in Q1.
Loan growth continue to be dampened by the run-off of non-core loans, on the other hand, loans in our business segments were up $45 billion, or 5.5% year-over-year.
Switching to average deposits and looking at the bottom right, growth was $41 billion, or 3% year-over-year.
Year-over-year, GAAP NII is up $550 million, or 5%, reflecting the benefits of both higher interest rates, as well as long deposit growth, partially offsetting this growth was the absence of NII resulting from 2Q 2017 sale of the UK consumer credit card business and higher funding costs for Global Markets.
We continue to reduce non-client-facing roles, while increasing client-facing roles such as relationship bankers in consumer, business banking and commercial, as well as financial advisers in wealth management.
Another very strong quarter for this business, as the value of deposits, growth of both loans and deposits as well as the investments we have made in people and our ability to better connect with customers continue to improve financial results.
The value of our deposits as rates rose along with growth in client balances drove the 9% year-over-year improvement in revenue.
Year-over-year net charge-offs increased $105 million, as we continue to experience modest and expected seasoning of our credit card portfolio along with loan growth.
Looking first at revenue, driven by NII growth, revenue grew 9% year-over-year, reflecting the value of our deposits and our relationships with customers, which continue to deepen as we expand capabilities.
Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, you can see the success we continue to have growing deposits, loans and brokerage assets.
Strong client activity, a market, which was up year-over-year, higher rates and solid expense management pushed GWIMÃ¢ÂÂs earnings this quarter to over $1 billion for the first time ever.
Year-over-year client balances rose $140 billion, or 5% to $2.7 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth.
Average loans of $159 billion grew 7% year-over-year and the growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate, as well as structured lending.
On a pre-tax basis, earnings declined 2% year-over-year, driven by lower investment banking fees and revenue impacts on an FTE basis of tax reform with respect to tax advantage assets.
Global Banking grew loans 3% year-over-year to a record $352 billion.
On a pre-tax basis, earnings were down modestly year-over-year, driven by lower revenue and increased expenses from continued technology investments, up 1% year-over-year, sales and trading totaled $4.1 - of the $4.7 billion in revenue.
In terms of expenses, Paul and Brian, youÃ¢ÂÂve - youÃ¢ÂÂre on track clearly to get to your target of the ballpark $53 billion for this year.
John, itÃ¢ÂÂs our view - what we said, I think, the last quarter was the investments weÃ¢ÂÂll make are - will be funded with the hard work in operating leverage and simplify and improve in organizational health and operational excellence.
And weÃ¢ÂÂve - we announced the investments weÃ¢ÂÂre making in the retail business and itÃ¢ÂÂs all contemplated with in the $53 billion - in the low $53 billion level, which we ought to be able to maintain in 1920.
And then also on the credit cards, it looks like youÃ¢ÂÂre getting solid card growth now and balances of 5% year-over-year.
We would expect it to be around 3% kind of if you look at the remainder of the year, remember, Q2 is usually seasonally the highest quarter in terms of credit card net charge-off.
IÃ¢ÂÂd add one thing, John, people forget that we also got out of - been sold a lot of businesses pieces and card over the years, including another one that will go out over the next quarter or so.
And so the growth weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in the underlying million plus cards - new cards we do every quarter and the usage by the customers and primary usage has been pretty consistent and ought to bode well for continued growth.
I think the reason for that is, certainly, in Bank of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs case, we deliver a lot of value to depositors, transparency, convenience, safety, mobile banking, online banking, weÃ¢ÂÂre rolling out new capabilities every day with Erica, nationwide network, rewards, advice and counsel that has real value to people beyond just the deposit rate paid.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue to balance the needs of our customers in the competitive market environment with that of our shareholdersÃ¢ÂÂ interests and weÃ¢ÂÂll do the right thing at the right moment.
And as we add more accounts and grow in these new markets, weÃ¢ÂÂre getting the primary relationship in the household, which means youÃ¢ÂÂre getting the transaction money, which is moving at all times.
I guess, the first thing I would say, I think, we think itÃ¢ÂÂs constructive, right, growing the balance sheet and increasing buybacks or continuing buybacks and stressfully to make a lot of sense.
And on an ongoing forward-looking basis, we feel good about the stress depletion and the stress capital buffer because of the way we run the company, and weÃ¢ÂÂre focused on responsible growth, loans in consumer prime and super price.
So, I think itÃ¢ÂÂs just going to keep going in the right direction and all that bodes well to helping us make that change with expenses basically down in the company year-over-year and consumer basically flattish.
Ã¢ÂÂ¦quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year again and again, while weÃ¢ÂÂre still adding new branches and investing in those cities at the same time.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs always going to be a question of modest changes, because remember, weÃ¢ÂÂre adding the branches and taking them out and redoing branches and making them bigger.
So on a year-over-year basis a lot of the increase in Global Markets was a result of client activity in equities.
We have to make sure we have enough liquidity and enough capital to run the company in good times and bad, and I think weÃ¢ÂÂre doing all those things.
In terms of - we discussed kind of the impact on the companyÃ¢ÂÂs net interest margin or net interest yield whatever you prefer, that is being affected by one, the fact that UK card we sold in the second quarter; but two, weÃ¢ÂÂre growing global market assets.
In terms of the cash youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing on the balance sheet, yes, deposit, we have deposit growth.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre still going to grow our balance sheet in markets.
So the fact that weÃ¢ÂÂre able to grow loans in Global Banking by as much as we have, even though weÃ¢ÂÂve been more cautious in CRE is another indication of the strength of our platform.
Yes, itÃ¢ÂÂs impacted by the growth in Global Markets, but itÃ¢ÂÂs also impacted quarter-over-quarter by the change in corporate tax rate on an FTE basis.
And which business segment, I think, is probably in the - itÃ¢ÂÂs not in the consumer side, it sounds like, which segment thatÃ¢ÂÂs coming from?
Look, we are - the way our securities portfolio works is, we grow deposits and we try to put all that deposit growth to work in customer assets within our client and risk framework.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre buying securities that we think makes sense to balance liquidity, earnings and capital of the company in all sorts of market environments.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs a customer business and thatÃ¢ÂÂs how weÃ¢ÂÂve been driving.
I think in small business this quarter year-over-year, we had about a 9% growth in loan balances and business banking probably had mid single digits, and that shows you sort of the breadth of the franchise.
But the second question is, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen again, looking longer-term going back to the fourth quarter of 2015 something like 160, 165 basis point increase in the overnight rate and the net interest margin of the bank is up 25 basis points.
Look, well, we told you that versus last year first quarter that have been up 12 basis points that we sold a portfolio of higher yielding cards.
Good day, everyone, and welcome to todayÃ¢ÂÂs Bank of AmericaÃ¢ÂÂs First Quarter Earnings Announcement 2018.
This quarter, we highlighted over the next four years, weÃ¢ÂÂll open 500 new centers and redesign more than 1,500 centers completing the task that weÃ¢ÂÂve been after for many years.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre expanding those to markets, where we traditionally have had commercial wealth management businesses and now weÃ¢ÂÂll have a full franchise.
Loans on a period end basis declined $2.7 billion, as consumers began paying down credit card balances, following a period of strong holiday spend in Q4.
Liquidity remain strong with average global equity sources of $522 billion and liquidity coverage ratio of 124%.
Global market activity drove the increase under both approaches, but the increase was offset under advanced by declines in consumer credit and continued roll off of legacy mortgages.
The supplemental leverage ratio declined modestly from balance sheet growth, but continued to well exceed regulatory minimums.
Note that the Q2 2017 sale of UK card and the Q4 2017 sale of remaining small positions of student loans and manufactured housing loans impacted the year-over-year comparisons by a little more than $10 billion.
Global Banking deposits increased $19 billion, or 6%, as we grew client balances domestically across all sectors of commercial clients and internationally with corporate clients.
As Brian mentioned, aside from the Q4 single-name commercial loss, our net charge-offs and resulting loss ratio have been quite consistent.
The net reserve release reflects continued improvement in our legacy commercial real estate and energy portfolios with a modest build for continued credit card seasoning.
Our reserve coverage remained strong with an allowance loan ratio of 1.1% and a coverage level 2.8 times our annual net charge-offs for the quarter.
Focusing on net interest yield, it is flat year-over-year as the benefits of broad improvement in asset yields versus funding costs was offset by two notable factors: First, the Q2 2017 sale of higher yielding UK car portfolio; and second, the impact from the lower yielding Global Markets assets.
Compared to Q4 2017, NII on a GAAP basis improved $146 million, as the net benefits of higher interest rates across the curve offset two less interest accrual days.
In the most recent quarter, we increased rates on certain wealth management deposits to keep pace with market-based alternatives.
The increase of $622 million was driven by seasonal elevation of payroll tax expense and higher expenses associated with revenue, mostly in Global Markets, but also in wealth management modestly offsetting these increases or operational cost reductions.
Whether it is access to one of our 4,000 licensed advisers and to world-leading research platform or how we integrate Merrill Edge into other banking needs, we think customers are noticing and giving us more of their investment dollars.
Expenses are up 2% year-over-year as investment in renovating branches and technology initiatives modestly outpaced continued optimization and savings from digitalization, and we continue to make progress on our announced investments in new and renovating financial centers, including entry into new markets.
This quarter customers logged into the Bank of America mobile banking app 1.4 billion times to either transact or shop with us.
This allows us to not only better understand and prepare for customer needs, but also to better manage our professional staffing within our busy financial centers.
Turning to record results in our Global Wealth and Investment Management business on Slide 14.
Strong AUM flows over the past 12 months and a tailwind with respect to market appreciation once again drove strong asset management fees offsetting modest pricing pressure.
Revenue growth coupled with careful expense management drove 3% operating leverage.
In fact, we saw positive brokerage flows for the first time in a couple of years, all while experiencing record low competitive adviser attrition.
With respect to revenue, IB fees were down in line with a reduction in the industryÃ¢ÂÂs IB fee pool, reflecting the tough comparison against a strong Q1 2017 IB fees of $1.35 billion for the overall company declined 15% year-over-year.
Expenses reflect operational savings mostly offset in our investment in additional client-facing professionals to enhance local market coverage.
Results were driven by increased client activity and a strong trading performance in derivatives.
The equity business also benefited from an increase in client financing activities.
Revenue in fixed sales and trading at $2.5 billion increased 13%, driven by lower client activity and less favorable credit markets compared to a very robust prior year quarter.
Noninterest expense improved approximately $500 million year-over-year, due to lower mortgage servicing costs, reduced operational costs from the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and lower litigation expenses.
[Operator Instructions] WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our first question from John McDonald of Bernstein.
When do you think that pressure starts to build in your business sources, because thereÃ¢ÂÂs - their transaction you just donÃ¢ÂÂt think thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of pressure for your pricing retail deposits right now?
And I think this value plus the lack of market pressure so far has allowed us to keep deposit rates relatively flat in traditional accounts.
Is that sort of reflective of that experience that the type of deposit youÃ¢ÂÂre attracting are lower rates and maybe you initially thought and you have a little bit more sensitivity at the short end even after number rate actually seen?
The question weÃ¢ÂÂve all asked ourselves over and over again, so itÃ¢ÂÂs proving very successful, can even accelerate it faster.
And I know a while ago you mentioned processing costs associated with cash and checks were pretty high, if I recall correctly, somewhere around $5 billion with all the digital activity that youÃ¢ÂÂre doing now.
Yes. At the same time, we still have 850,000 people coming to branches every day that need to have highly qualified capable people servicing, so investing in those sales professionals.
We are in a situation today, where securities rolling off the balance sheet are being replaced by securities at higher yields, so thatÃ¢ÂÂs good.
But again, itÃ¢ÂÂs not like weÃ¢ÂÂre out there doing derivatives or doing other things to manufacture a certain type of balance sheet.
You saw the RWA comes down under the advanced approach this quarter, even though weÃ¢ÂÂve been growing the balance sheet in markets.
We - weÃ¢ÂÂve been seeing mid single-digit loan growth in our business segments.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been seeing C&I growth 4% or 5% every quarter.
Is there anyway to break that down between just overall growth among existing customers versus what youÃ¢ÂÂre getting from entrance into new markets?
But IÃ¢ÂÂm just wondering, because IÃ¢ÂÂm going back two years and not just looking at one quarter, and IÃ¢ÂÂm seeing that common equity just doesnÃ¢ÂÂt grow.

boa,q2,2018,"It has enabled us to increase returns and support customer growth in a real economy, and to continue to invest through our operational excellence.
In second quarter, reported pre-tax income improved 5% year-over-year, but after adjusting for some select items which Paul is going to cover later, a better way to look at it is pre-tax income is up 11%.
As you can see on Slide 2, credit continues to perform well with a 43 basis point net charge-off ratio this quarter.
When people ask for examples of how all this works, how can you invest in developing capabilities while continuing to take down costs and continuing to have higher customer satisfaction, I think the easier way for people to visualize that is in our consumer digital banking capabilities.
We had a half million digital appointments this quarter, but thatÃ¢ÂÂs still a lot of room to grow when you think of the 50 million customers we have that walk into our great stores every day, so itÃ¢ÂÂs critical to have just both the digital and physical.
Digital mortgage, which is a true end-to-end digital experience just brought out recently, you can see is growing fast; and on investments in the lower right hand side, you can see the Merrill Edge platform growing assets 20% in the past year to $191 billion and 2.5 million accounts.
In 2Q17, we had a net after-tax gain from the sale of our U.K. card consumer business of roughly $100 million, which included a revenue benefit of nearly $800 million in other income mostly offset by a tax cost of nearly $700 million, so revenue was $22.6 billion on a reported basis, down 1% versus 2Q17, however excluding the impact of the U.K. card gain, revenue was up 3% year-over-year driven by NII improvement and better sales and trading results.
Provision expense was $827 million, $101 million higher than 2Q17 driven primarily by the seasoning of our credit card portfolio, loan growth, and a modestly lower reserve release.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 7, overall compared to the end of Q1, end of period assets of $2.3 trillion decreased $37 billion, driven by lower global markets assets as well lower deposit levels, primarily due to seasonal customer tax payments.
If you look at the first half of the year, we issued $3.5 billion of lower yielding preferred stock ahead of redemptions of $2.8 billion of higher yielding preferred stock, and note we have called another $900 million that will settle in the third quarter.
Given a billion dollar decline in the value of AFS securities, which impacts OCI, common equity decreased by half a billion dollars as we returned 90% of net income earned in the quarter to our shareholder via dividends and repurchases.
Turning to Slide 8, on an average basis total loans increased to $935 billion.
Turning to asset quality on Slide 9, total net charge-offs were $996 million or 43 basis points of average loans, and increased as expected.
The increase in net charge-offs versus 2Q17 was due primarily to credit card seasoning, loan growth and the storm-related losses.
Turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on Slide 13, another great quarter for this business as client balances grew, revenues increases, and expenses were down.
As rates rose and given our solid growth in client balances, the value of our deposits drove an 8% improvement in revenue year-over-year.
Net charge-offs increased $105 million from 2Q17 as our credit card portfolio grows and continues to season.
Turning to global wealth and investment management on Slide 15, GUM produced another quarter of solid results, nearing the record $1 billion of net income earned in Q1 and producing the second highest pre-tax margin ever at 28%.
Year-over-year, client balances rose to record levels of nearly $2.8 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows, and continued low growth.
Average loans of $161 billion grew 7% year-over-year with continued strength in consumer real estate and structured lending.
Turning to Slide 17, global banking earned just over $2 billion, growing 16% from 2Q17 and generating a 20% return on allocated capital.
Looking at trends on Slide 18 and comparing to Q2 last year, with respect to average loans, 3% growth was led by corporate banking lending in international regions.
Brian, how should we think about the $500 million technology investment that you mentioned in the press release over the next few quarters, and whatÃ¢ÂÂs it mean for the target of approximately $53 billion in expenses this year and also your ability to keep expenses flattish into Ã¢ÂÂ19 and Ã¢ÂÂ20, which youÃ¢ÂÂve previously talked about?
We expect to manage a lot of that through self-funding, for lack of a better term, by continuing to improve of our expenses what weÃ¢ÂÂve seen, so you should think in the $53 billion, low $53 billion range this quarter and keeping it relatively flat, and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to work this self-funded.
So yes, I would expect that kind of a range as your look out the next couple of quarters, and that would reflect seasoning and loan growth in the card portfolio in that number.
I mean, we would expect provision to be roughly in line with net charge-offs with reserve releases moderating over time as we continue to build allowance in support of loan growth, particularly in card.
I want to ask an NII question, and I saw the comments on ex-global markets, the net interest yield being up 12 basis points, deposit betas are good, so the core business that we all focus on is good.
On car, weÃ¢ÂÂve seen mid single digit year-over-year growth which has modestly increased over the last couple of quarters.
With respect to consumer real estate, originations are solid and balances are growing well, but there are headwinds continuing from the run-off from the non-core portfolio; and remember, weÃ¢ÂÂre booking 90% of our mortgages now on the balance sheet.
Okay, and as we think about in that context deposit growth slowing, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know if itÃ¢ÂÂs a large impact from the TRUPS, how do you think about--and your rates on [indiscernible], how do we think about NII growth going forward given the implied curve today?
Yes, well we will clearly benefit from the June rate hike, Q3 is going to have an extra day, and weÃ¢ÂÂre also going to benefit from expected loan and deposit growth, but these benefits are going to be offset by rate increases on deposits.
The good news in consumer is weÃ¢ÂÂve grown number of checking accounts for the first time in the last six or eight quarters consistently due to all the repositioning weÃ¢ÂÂre doing with accounts, and the average balance has gone up and are all checking, so that is very beneficial for us going forward.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been able to maintain discipline on that side and generate another $30 billion-odd of year-over-year deposit growth, which is pretty good, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs all core market share gains because weÃ¢ÂÂre not doing CDs and other stuff.
TheyÃ¢ÂÂll continue to move, but you back that all [indiscernible] you still see the asset sensitivity just under $3 billion for 100 basis point rise, 70% is in the short term, and that takes all the stuff weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about and puts it into the forward curve assumptions.
If I could follow up a little bit more on that lower right part of the funding side, Paul, can you walk us through the benefits you expect from trust preferred redemption and if you are going to have to refinance that, and what would be the net benefit as you think about that and forward NII?
I think thereÃ¢ÂÂs lots of trade-offs consumers make, but this is the money going in and out of their checking account on a given day, so youÃ¢ÂÂre growing the average balance, the $7,500 between our preferred and our retail segment, theyÃ¢ÂÂd be different each segment, but this is money in motion, for lack of a better term, Mike, as youÃ¢ÂÂre thinking about it, so to move it around very carefully has implications if they donÃ¢ÂÂt keep the balances there if a payment hits or something like that.
A little of that on a same expense base makes a heck of a turn, and if you think about, 850 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year matched quarter is pretty effective, so itÃ¢ÂÂs a combination of all those investments I talked about earlier coming true and the efficiency embedded in that, the combination of more sales digital and efficiency embedded in the sales process, because this 48% counts everything, and a combination of continuing to grow in checking accounts and the deposit balances, which are the highest potential revenue growth product forum in the short term with a big business like that.
Yes, but itÃ¢ÂÂs about, all told, I think 35, 40% of the sales transactions are initiated by a marketing lead, for lack of a better term, driven by analytics into the branch system or into the digital experience.
As you know, that modeling includes a 50% pass-through rate, so as I said before, we have some nice tailwinds in this quarter, and going into year end, weÃ¢ÂÂve got the rate hike, weÃ¢ÂÂve got the extra day, and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to see loan and deposit growth, but thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be offset by whatever happens on the deposit side.
I mean, I guess the asset sensitivity--you know, weÃ¢ÂÂve had rates move up more than expected the last few quarters, and obviously there is some one-offs in the net interest income, but it hasnÃ¢ÂÂt been a very good guide the last few quarters.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve grown quarter over quarter $660 million, first half of the year I think itÃ¢ÂÂs $1.2 billion on a GAAP basis.
More generally, weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing growth in our card balances and we think thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to continue in 2018 as we add new accounts at a healthy pace.
Got it, so itÃ¢ÂÂs trading-related NII, but what weÃ¢ÂÂre looking at is Page 9 in the supplement - you know, the cost went to $1,462 million versus $1,135, and itÃ¢ÂÂs a sequential increase of about 49 basis points.
Then the usage of it is integrated high touch, high tech, so thereÃ¢ÂÂs still people--you know, thereÃ¢ÂÂs still talent, teammates taking $50 million business to the branch a quarter and doing a great job with them, and weÃ¢ÂÂre driving people to branches for relationship management at the same time weÃ¢ÂÂre doing other things with their devices, so it is absolutely a combined set of capabilities and youÃ¢ÂÂre looking across all of them.
So all that together, itÃ¢ÂÂs a complex thing, but at the end of the day when you put it all together, we made $2.8 billion after tax, 48% efficiency ratio, deposits grew by $35 billion year-over-year, $26 billion of which was checking, to give you a sense, which relies on all those great capabilities to fuel it and why we think weÃ¢ÂÂre taking share.
ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no recently we have to do this - weÃ¢ÂÂve been doing this for years, so if you look back and look at our commercial loan growth, itÃ¢ÂÂs been mid single digits, and our small business loan growth this quarter was very strong and has been for many quarters, as the team continues to drive it.
We break it out for you right there - we have total loans, then the run-off portfolio, then the business segments, and then we added this quarter so you could see the consistent year-over-year growth in loans weÃ¢ÂÂve been experiencing.
Returns are strong and we continue to drive it, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter.
Good morning everyone and welcome to todayÃ¢ÂÂs Bank of America earnings announcement.
Continued solid client activity in a growing economy coupled with strong cost and risk management discipline resulted in a strong quarter of results.
Our immediate priority remains to use capital to buy back shares that we donÃ¢ÂÂt need for business growth, but importantly we increased our dividend by 25%.
This quarter marks the 11th straight quarter where Bank of America has grown its average deposits more than $40 billion on a year-over-year quarter comparison basis.
Here we display the results, and typically Paul will cover these [indiscernible], but I think itÃ¢ÂÂs important to understand how responsible growth in driving sustainable operating leverage works.
Before I review comparative period performance, let me remind you of a few select items which I think are helpful in understanding our operating performance.
Our consumer loans grew 6% year-over-year as clients grew card balances 5% and mortgage originations across both consumer banking and wealth management were equally strong.
Strong year-over-year growth in structured lending with wealth management clients also contributed to commercial loan growth.
Our reserve coverage remains strong with an allowance to loan ratio of 1.08% and a coverage level 2.6 times our annual net charge-offs for the quarter.
These assets resulting from client financing and trading activity generally are shorter term and have a lower net interest yield than core banking assets.
The net interest yield excluding global markets increased 12 basis points year-over-year to 2.95% driven by broad improvement in asset yields relative to funding costs.
Moving back to total NII, Q2 GAAP NII increased modestly versus Q1 as the benefits of higher interest rates and one extra day was offset by seasonal client activity in global markets and seasonal pay downs of credit card loans.
As I mentioned earlier, 2Q17 included roughly $300 million in impairment associated with data centers that we sold, so excluding that charge, expense still declined nearly $400 million or 3% with broad improvements across most categories.
Consumer banking created over 850 basis points of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 8% while expenses were down.
Customer satisfaction in consumer banking reached a new high with roughly 81% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale.
Expenses were down slightly compared to 2Q17 as productivity improvements more than offset the continued investment in financial center renovations and technology initiatives.
Strong client activity and a healthy equity market coupled with solid expense management all benefited results.
IB fees of $1.4 billion for the overall firm declined 7% year-over-year driven by lower advisory fees from a record quarter a year ago.
Expenses were relatively flat versus 2Q17 despite our continued investment in additional client-facing professionals to enhance local market coverage.
Earnings were up 35% as revenue growth outpaced expense increases from higher revenue-led costs and continued technology investments.
Equity derivatives also benefited from increased client activity driven by volatility in financial markets.
Just a couple thoughts to close and then weÃ¢ÂÂll take your questions.
WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our first question from John McDonald with Bernstein.
WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre focused on attracting relatively high quality card customers and then rewarding them for deepening their overall relationship with us, and we think that strategy is driving incremental deposit growth, making our deposits more sticky.
One is as youÃ¢ÂÂve come through all of the regulatory requirements and working through what issues you had coming out of the financial crisis, do you think Bank of America today is better prepared to be able to really fund economic growth as it looks out more than internal?
WeÃ¢ÂÂll take todayÃ¢ÂÂs final question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
",45.63,0.90131354
boa,q3,2018,"We now reduced our average diluted shares by $1.4 billion from their peak and outstanding shares fell below a $10 billion market quarter, which is below the level we started at with this management team in 2010.
The $350 billion of those checking balances have grown every quarter since 2012; they were up 9% on a compounded growth rate since that time.
Annualized net household growth, Merrill Lynch is up nearly 4 times from last yearÃ¢ÂÂs advisors with more accounts.
Net charge-offs and ratios declined from second quarter levels as did nearly every key asset quality metric.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs a $3 billion a year pace or nearly a third of our current annual technology and operations budget.
In our wealth management business, we are rolling out a sleeker Merrill Lynch digital platform with more integration between banking and investing, along with adding industry leading capabilities or market data, enhanced document scanning and texting capabilities between advisors and our clients.
Over the last three years, weÃ¢ÂÂve added 103 brand new financial centers with improved layouts and technology capabilities for customers.
NPLs, reservable criticized exposure and delinquencies all declined while net charge-offs were up $32 million year-over-year, mostly from seasoning of our credit card portfolio and loan growth.
Non-bank lenders have likely increased their market share, and companies remain flushed with cash and are generating solid earnings.
Total net charge-offs were $932 million or 40 basis points of average loans.
Net charge-offs were up $32 million from a year ago, as we saw expected seasoning and balance growth in credit cards.
Provision expense included a $216 million net reserve release, reflecting improvement in our consumer real estate and energy portfolio as well as other more broad-based commercial improvements.
The benefit of higher interest rates as well as loan deposit growth was modestly offset by higher funding costs in Global Markets.
Note that we have presented net interest yield excluding our Global Markets segment which primarily reflects our trading-related assets, so that you can see more transparency into our banking activities.
Another outstanding quarter for this segment as client balances grew, revenues increased and expenses were down.
Consumer Banking created nearly 1,000 basis points of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 7% while expenses were down 2%.
Customer satisfaction in Consumer Banking reached a new high with more than 80% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale.
Strong client activity and a healthy equity market coupled with solid expense management all benefited results.
Advisors have responded positively and we have seen year-to-date net household on an annualized basis grew 4 times faster than 2017.
Average loans of a $162 billion grew 5% year-over-year with continued strength in consumer real estate and custom lending.
Year-over-year revenue growth of 4% was led by a 9% increase in asset management fees and modestly higher NII, partially offset by lower transactional revenue.
Global Banking earned slightly less than $2 billion and generated a 19% return on allocated capital.
Expenses were held flat versus Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ17 despite our continued investments in the business, including the addition of sales professionals to enhance local market coverage.
Global Markets grew earnings by 28% year-over-year to just under $1 billion, producing a solid return on allocated capital of 11%.
[Operator Instructions] WeÃ¢ÂÂll take our first question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
There has been a lot of focus in the press on some of the senior personnel changes at the investment bank whether your lack of risk appetite maybe negatively impacted revenue growth?
Each year, we invest probably $0.5 billion in initiatives to help drive efficiencies.
If you continue to deliver that positive operating leverage into next year and 2020, which seems likely, is there any reason you shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt aspire to get to that mid-50s over time on that metric?
If you look at CRE, I think weÃ¢ÂÂve talked about in past quarters we transformed our approach to commercial real estate lending.
CRE is going to turn out to be a great example of responsible growth and how maintaining a strong balance sheet and disciplined underwriting standards through the cycle means youÃ¢ÂÂre going to be able to deliver for your customers and clients when others canÃ¢ÂÂt.
And earning asset yields were up 11 basis points.
There looks to be some noise in other earning assets this particular quarter.
I donÃ¢ÂÂt think thereÃ¢ÂÂs anything unusual in the consumer loan portfolio thatÃ¢ÂÂs driving those.
But, if you take into account your funding which -- borrowing is a little bit more of a fixed rate, as well as non-interest bearing funds, you really have headroom with how far earning assets are going up at 10 or 11 basis points per quarter or per rate hike to increase interest bearing deposit rates somewhere between 85% and 95% before you really see any pressure on net interest margin.
What investors I think are missing is thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of headroom to still kind of trickle up those deposit rates and still continue to improve net interest margin.
The value of our deposit franchise is showing both in our NII and our net interest yield improvement, and Paul is going to take through the details on that later.
Our balance sheet from both a capital and liquidity standpoint remained very strong, allowing us to pay $4 billion in common dividends year-to-date and spend $15 billion to reduce our share count in the same period.
Our commercial loan growth as youÃ¢ÂÂve seen in the market, moderated a bit this quarter, but keep in mind that many companies came into the year flush with cash.
This marks the 12th straight quarter we have grown average deposits by $40 billion on a year-over-year basis.
In addition, Global Banking deposits grew nicely as well and wealth management continued to stabilize.
As you go to slide three, in 2015 and 2016, some of you also questioned whether we could drive operating leverage; with expenses attributable to run-off activities, or were they not generating enough revenue.
Growth was strong, even if you adjust for the lower tax rate from the Tax Act. Year-over-year, pretax income, as Brian noted, reached a record $9 billion, up 18%.
We thought it would be helpful to show deposit growth in a little more detail this quarter.
Secondly, June was down a little over that time period consistent with other wealth managers, for all the reasons that we reviewed in the past quarters around deposit alternatives.
Also within Global Banking, in addition to the growth, note the rotation from non-interest bearing to interest bearing deposits.
In addition to the typical run-off, near the end of this quarter, we sold the portfolio of non-core consumer real estate loans with the book value of $3.7 billion, recording a small gain.
Our consumer loans grew 5% year-over-year, as mortgage originations grew across both Consumer Banking and wealth management, and clients grew card balances 3%.
Higher interest rates and deposit growth also drove the linked quarter improvement, aided by an additional net interest.
For 4 years now, our teams have driven expenses lower every quarter on a year-over-year basis, with only one exception, our efficiency ratio of 57%, improving 400 basis points from Q3 Ã¢ÂÂ17.
This quarter, earnings grew 49% to $3.1 billion, marking the 13th consecutive quarter that earnings in Consumer Banking have increased year-over-year.
With 4% year-over-year deposit growth and 8% increase in consumer payments, we believe we are gaining share and deepening relationships.
The cost of running the business continues its decline as the cost of deposit fell to 152 basis points, while the rate paid remained low at 6 basis points.
The business created more than 200 basis points of operating leverage, growing revenue 4% while holding expense growth to 1%.
Year-over-year, client balances rose to record levels of more than $2.8 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows and continued loan growth.
At 2% year-over-year, growth in average loans moderated this quarter while deposits grew 7%.
The big debate is if the economy slowed down a little bit from the current growth rate next year, as many people projected, if it goes into recession, that changes the picture obviously.
So, on the Global Banking side, these are operating deposits that weÃ¢ÂÂre growing.
In terms of how are we growing deposits across the franchise with as little deposit rate paid growth that weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing.
First of all, we are growing -- we are increasing deposit rate paid in GWIM and Global Banking.
We and the industry have not increased deposit rates appreciably in traditional consumer bank accounts.
At some point, rates are going to rise in consumer as well, and our focus is on balancing our customersÃ¢ÂÂ needs with the competitive marketplace and our shareholdersÃ¢ÂÂ interest, and weÃ¢ÂÂll do the right thing.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs been material relative to the start to finish and weÃ¢ÂÂve crossed a $100 million branch for example in Denver within three years, which is very strong, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not material to the $1.4 trillion deposit base or the $680 billion in consumer.
So, those deposits come from the ability to continue to provide better and better services to clients in an investment rate, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs the thing.
So, specifically, headcount reductions are due to continued applying of technology, branch reductions, bigger branches, more sales and relationship management people, but less number in footprint and more efficient -- more activity by the customer taking to the digital platforms, digital sales at 23%, and itÃ¢ÂÂs just bringing square footage down in the company from 130 million to about 75 million, continued densification beyond that due to not only reduced FTE, but also the ability to densify the space through some of the work weÃ¢ÂÂre doing in new space, for example, in New York.
Maybe just a quick question on just sort of consumer spend on debit and credit cards, 7% growth felt good, but a little bit of a deceleration from the first half.
I think, the only real question is how much of these benefits are going to be offset by rate increases on deposits.
Having said that, so far, as I think about NII growth in Q4, and itÃ¢ÂÂs obviously early, it sounds a lot like Q3 to me.
As you stretch out into the future, move into Ã¢ÂÂ19, weÃ¢ÂÂre obviously going to factor in the day count as you think about each quarter.
I would think about it -- I mean, as weÃ¢ÂÂve started Q4 and itÃ¢ÂÂs early, the NII growth weÃ¢ÂÂre feeling feels a lot like Q3 in terms of the movement in rate paid so far.
And so, I would think about it as a year-over-year growth being something that feels the same this early in the quarter.
And then, just a little bit related, as we think about the NIM percentage, obviously a nice increase this quarter.
But, again, that increase is going to be dependent on several factors, including loan growth, mix shift, particularly in Global Markets, youÃ¢ÂÂve got the realization of the forward curve, youÃ¢ÂÂve got the competitive bottom with respect to deposit rate paid.
I mean, weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing the benefits of our strong deposit base, how weÃ¢ÂÂve invested in our clients in a rising rate environment, weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing that if you look at the Ã¢ÂÂbanking bookÃ¢ÂÂ.
Look, I think what we would emphasize is given the strength of our platform, given the bankers that weÃ¢ÂÂre adding, given our relationships globally, we should be able to grow loans the way weÃ¢ÂÂve been talking about, even with these forces, even with the non-banks, even with whatever youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing out there.
ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of discussion there, but at the end of the day, we think we can grow loans in the mid-single digits at 2, 3% GDP growth.
So, I think there is headroom for us to continue to expand that net interest income margin percent over time as we see a higher rate structure lock in the balance sheet for a host of reasons, most important of which is the checking accounts in consumer, which we talked about, will always have a very advantaged place.
And if we ever need to retain it, any portion of it is going to be in conjunction with earnings, which are accretive to the returns in the balance sheet, but just between repositioning loans that you can still see, despite all the efforts -- despite 12 years from the last time some of these loans were produced, we still have $60 billion of non-core loans, which continue to run off that we can replace with $60 billion of good credit, which should be another, I donÃ¢ÂÂt know, 6%, 7% growth over the current core business loans.
And to do that, weÃ¢ÂÂve managed expenses well, drove operating leverage 700 basis points for the quarter.

boa,q4,2018,"We expect to continue to drive incremental improvement in these businesses as we take advantage of our very strong franchise and the continued investments in digitalization and operating efficiency, as well as our relationship management capacity and core products and services.
In our consumer banking, after a decade of simplifying our products, reviewing our focus on primary accounts, transforming our delivery network, and driving deeper relationship with our customers, we have seen net new checking accounts growing and those are growing with the same strong core attributes of our existing book.
In Merrill Edge investment assets, we had a 21% year-over-year increase in funded brokerage assets and 25 billion of net client flows.
And when you go on to the institutional investor side of the house, through our investments in the business and increased balance sheet commitment to our clients, we've seen an expansion in our prime brokerage business; and as a result, we had a record revenue year in our equities business.
As you turn to Slide 4, one of the drivers of an expansion in our client base is the fruit of multiple years of continuous improvement in our franchise.
So as you look forward into 2019 and consider the beta where the NII can grow, short term rate increases stop or slow, weÃ¢ÂÂll drive what we control with loan and deposit growth, and even in an unchanged rate environment, that should produce more NII.
So we strive to deliver what we control; more customers, more activities from those customers whether itÃ¢ÂÂs loans, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs deposits, whether it's assets under management, whether it's underwriting fees, whether it's trading revenue, we continue to drive what we control and we control the risk and expenses, and we do this while driving our competitive advantage through increasing investments in people, technology, and physical [ph] plan.
Now, before I ask Paul to dive in the quarter, I wanted to give you - we're all facing a perceived change in the operating environment with predictions in the year ahead reflecting a range of outcomes from GDP growth in the mid 2's to lower growth to recession.
Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10, overall compared to the end of Q3 the balance sheet grew $16 billion, driven by commercial loan growth.
RWA decline was driven by lower global markets RWA and the sale of non-core consumer loans, which offset the impact of loan growth across the businesses.
Global Banking deposits continue to grow well, up 9% year-over-year, reflecting the investments we have made in client-facing bankers and global treasury services capabilities.
As you think about starting loan levels for the new year, note that towards the end of the quarter, we originated several large primarily investment-grade financings, which resulted in loans ending the quarter $13 billion higher than the average for the quarter.
The improvement was driven by the value over deposits as interest rates rose as well as loan and deposit growth and was partially offset by higher funding cost in Global Markets and lower loan spreads.
Linked-quarter growth reflects the benefit of the September rate hike, loan and deposit growth, and lower long-term debt expense.
As we viewed earlier, we grew Consumer Banking deposits 3% year-over-year and the percentage of check-in accounts that are now the primary account of a household increased to 91%.
You will also note non-interest income improved year-over-year from account growth and higher levels of consumer spending.
Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 20, GWIM produced another quarter of strong results, delivering client flows totaling $35 billion, one of the best quarters of client flows in the company's history, which is partially due to growth in net new households.
Net income of more than $1 billion was the best quarter ever for this segment, growing 43% year-over-year.
Revenue included solid growth in NII and noninterest income, overcoming some of the negative impacts of the decline in the financial markets early in the quarter.
Revenue was led by 4% growth in NII from strong deposit growth and higher rates but was offset by the small decline in investment banking fees.
Comparisons against the prior year are impacted by the charges in Q4 '17 associated with the Tax Act, which reduced revenue by $946 million and increased tax expense by $1.9 billion.
And as Brian said, we also don't expect any meaningful change in net charge-offs in 2019, based on our years of responsible growth and our view of the credit horizon.
In terms of where do rates go from here, look I think Bank of America and indeed the rest of the industry really haven't increased deposit pricing on traditional bank accounts appreciably.
Mike to put it in perspective, I think we had $20-odd billion of fourth quarter '17 to fourth quarter '18 checking account growth in consumer.
So any technology adoption, people often attribute to millennials, but when you think about that kind of penetration of digital practice, a 1.5 billion log-ins a quarter, you have 77% of the checks deposited not at the branch i.e. So this is a broad-based trend that we've been driving and over the 10 years I talked about earlier, we had 6,100 branches, we have 4,200 branches.
It's always hard to - our market share in consumer deposits we think is around, I don't know, 13% 14%, 15% depending on what you calculate Mike and it's growing.
But we sort of stick to this model all the things you cited in your opening to your question is the model, right, which is grow revenue a little fast and economy, keep the investments flat, keep the credit risk in check, and drive that operating leverage and bring the share count down.
There's a fundamental resetting obviously through not only the operating performance but the tax reform, but now they're growing forward a little bit, but they'll be in that range, 14% 15% 16% return on tangible common equity then maybe move up higher than that on a given quarter, but I think we're in a solid place right now.
But we could always choose not to invest, but I think if you look at what we're investing in and you'd say, 'keep going.' Honestly as a shareholder, it will be a better answer for the company because the technology investments allow us to take long-term expenses down and things like that.
I mean, if you look at Q1, I would expect NIM to edge up a little bit driven by loan growth funded by low-cost deposits.
But I'll just follow up I guess on the earlier question on your - what a Fed pause would mean for your NIM and I think you mentioned Paul that it really depends on the forward curve and the ability to lag on deposit rates.
But in the consumer business, what is driving our deposit growth is the $20 billion from fourth quarter 2017 to fourth quarter 2018 and checking balance growth, which will always be tremendously advantaged from the perspective you're coming at which is a funding basis.
We'll continue to drive responsible growth and we look forward talking to you next quarter.
Looking at full year results, reported record earnings for our company of $28 billion after tax or $2.61 per share.
Revenue grew a little better than GDP at 3%, and when discussing the growth rate over 2017, weÃ¢ÂÂre increasing 2017 baseline as shown to add back the charges taken to the Tax Act last year.
To enable this investment, weÃ¢ÂÂve driven a culture of expense management as we reduced costs significantly over the past nine years while increasing our customer service scores and capabilities.
Now take a look at Slide 5, 16 consecutive quarters of operating leverage, every quarter for four straight years.
During that four-year period, we have invested $12 billion in new technology initiatives, retooled every single ATM in the company, rehabbed 1,500 branches, built hundreds of new branches, added new administrative facilities and added relationship management and sales teammates, and we've also shared success with our teammates.
NII is up $8 billion in the past four years, but what we often miss here it wasn't solely driven by higher rates.
Average deposits grew more than $150 billion after the past four years at a 4% compound annual growth rate.
We monitor their asset quality and we've seen it remain strong as net loss ratios are at record lows.
This growth was driven by 7% operating leverage and strong asset quality.
Total shareholder equity increased $3 billion from Q3 as AOCI benefited from increases in the value of our AFS debt securities, given the decline in long end rates.
GWIM's deposit balances benefited from market volatilities as customers moved from investments to cash.
Strong improvement in our core banking activities was partially offset by the impact of lower yielding Global Markets assets.
Including our global markets segment, which primarily reflects our trading-related assets, NII from core banking activities grew almost $1 billion year-over-year or 9%.
Turning to asset sensitivity, as of 12/31, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates above the forward curve is estimated to decrease NII by $2.7 billion over the subsequent 12 months.
This expense level includes approximately $1 billion for increased spending in the aggregate in several areas: Normal yearly merit, health care benefits primarily from inflation, marketing and the previously announced new investment initiative spending in technology as well as expansion and modernization of financial centers.
The net charge-off ratio declined to 39 basis points as losses declined while loans grew.
We created more than 1,000 basis of operating leverage this quarter as revenue grew 10% while expenses were held flat.
The business created more than 400 basis points of operating leverage, growing revenues 7% while holding expense growth to 2%.
Asset management fees were up 3% versus Q4 '17, driven by a solid year of AUM flows, but were mitigated by a decline in brokerage fees.
It is important to note as you look at 2019 that the December drop in equity markets doesn't actually impact AUM fees until Q1 '19 due to the one-month lag in the determination of fees for assets under management.
Strong household growth and continued near record low attrition of experienced financial advisors contributed to the $35 billion in overall client flows this quarter.
AUM outflows in the quarter reflected market volatility, which impacted some clients' preferences versus cash and deposits.
Global Banking achieved several records this quarter across revenue, net income, loan levels and deposit levels.
Compared to Q4 '17, modestly improved M&A fees only partially offset a decline in underwriting fees given the significant weakness in financing fee pools as corporations and other participants assessed significant market volatility late in the quarter.
Our balance sheet is strong and we returned more earnings to shareholders and while the market may now believe interest rate hikes have stopped, we believe we can grow net interest income without rate hikes assuming modest levels of loan and deposit growth.
So just using that example and if you look at charge-offs go back in 2010 I think there were $30 odd billion in the year and a big part of those credit card and related unsecured debt restructuring credit card loans.
I was wondering if you could talk about just your thoughts on managing interest rate risk, given the drop in most parts of the curve, lowered expectations for future short hikes and then maybe specifically the securities book.
So first thing to think about as we look at that securities book we're always, always, always balancing earnings against capital and liquidity.
And we would expect provision to roughly match net charge-offs depending on loan growth.
",49.08,0.720122
boa,q1,2019,"Through disciplined capital deployment after meeting all the requirements to make loans to our customers and support their businesses, we continue to drive our share count lower.
Turning to slide three, part of responsible growth is to produce sustainable results and part of that is to drive operational excellence, and we did it again this quarter.
The first bucket to spread revenue from loans and deposits, and the second bucket is recurring fees, like our cash management fees in our commercial business or consumer account fees or interchange and things like that.
So if you think about this quarter versus last year, our market related types of revenue was down 12%.
However, our laser like focus on expense management came to the table again and resulted in the year-over-year expense decline of 4%, which resulted in the 400 basis points of operating leverage.
When you think about how we're driving the company, while managing expenses we continue to invest in the future.
And we've been driving the operating leverage in each quarter, during that time, but we also continue to invest deeply in our franchise.
Across the company, we added 500 new sales professionals this quarter, more consumer relationship bankers, more wealth advisors, more commercial bankers and more business bankers, more small business bankers and more investment bankers.
Our pace of growth has consistently exceeded the industry's growth rates, customers value the capabilities rewards of their relationship and continue to see lower attrition and 90% plus primary bank status.
Particularly promising was a strong rebound in our middle market customer base, where we saw growth and line usage increase.
However, looking at across our business segments, core loans grew $33 billion or 4% on a year-over-year basis.
In fact, this quarter our ending balances in commercial banking shows the highest linked quarter growth rate in the last six years.
Despite a modest increase in the average balance sheet our return on assets in the company was 126 basis points and improve both on year ago and sequential quarter basis.
Deposit rates in our Wealth Management and Global Banking businesses increased however, we saw minimal movement in our consumer business.
But through loan and deposit growth, and picking up two additional days of interest over the next couple of quarters.
We also typically see less benefit from loan growth, driven by paydowns on year-end credit card balances in Q2.
Across the second half of the year, we expect NII to benefit from growth in loan and deposits as well as an additional day of interest in Q3.
Turning to expenses on slide 12, we continued to improve efficiency at $13.2 billion, we were down $618 million or 4% compared to Q1 2018.
However, please note, that the quarterly progression of expenses in 2019 may look a little different than the past years, as it will be impacted by the timing of planned technology and marketing spend.
Earnings grew 25% year-over-year to $3.2 billion.Q1 reflects continued strong momentum from 2018 as deposits grew $23 billion or 3%, revenue grew 7% and expenses were down 4%, creating operating leverage of 11%.
Investment assets in the Consumer segment, ended the quarter up $29 billion from Q1, 2018 on solid flows and a Q1, 2019 market rebound.
Turning to the slide 16, note the year-over-year real improvement in consumer banking NII, which drove our 7% growth.
Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 17, GWIM results were impressive, particularly given the revenue impact of the marketÃ¢ÂÂs decline at the end of December.
The business created 360 basis points of year-over-year operating leverage as expense declined 4%, while revenue was down only modestly.
Loans are higher by 3% year-over-year, reflecting strong mortgage growth given the decline in rates.
Looking at them separately and beginning with Global Banking on slide 19, the business earned $2 billion and generated a 20% return on allocated capital.
Revenue was up 3% year-over-year, we saw positive impacts from loan and deposit growth, as well as higher interest rates.
The business created more than 400 basis points of operating leverage, as revenue growth was matched with a 1% decline in expenses.
Paul, I was hoping that you cloud clarify the outlook for the net interest income, it sounds like you expect NII to be down sequentially in the second quarter on a few of those pressure points that you mentioned?
But as we move to the second half of the year, we expect to benefit from continued loan and deposit growth, plus another day of interest in Q3.
I think, Glenn what I was saying was that the -- you got to look at the -- what drives the value of the consumer deposit franchise in a company and that's a consumer side.
On the non-interest bearing side the reference was in the commercial side, which because the way cash management services are priced when rates rise people have to hold less balances to get the fees, it's credit rate goes up when rate stop rising, which really has happened that stabilizes and we have seen that and expected that to continue.
Just given the current outlook for loan and deposit growth and expectations for expenses to increase year-on-year at least for the remainder of 2019 are you still confident given the NII guidance and your ability to continue that momentum and deliver positive operating leverage even in the absence of higher rates?
You came in with an extremely low expense ratio this quarter, do you see that more as a one-off due to the fact that the revenues were a little lighter in the capital markets for the reasons you mentioned earlier?
But having said all that for the year is what I would focus on, we think we're going to be at $53 billion in change.
I think, Betsy just to give you -- look for our company and for U.S. economy, especially where we saw some relatively strong performance was in our middle market business this quarter and our small business.
In those -- that's good, because that means the core tens of thousands of customers in the middle market and the millions of small businesses are using their lines and line users went up by a percent middle market, small business, so I think originations were up 7%, 8% year-over-year in the quarter.
Look, the first thing I would say is, again, Brian said it, but remember we're focused not on products, but on increasing and deepening relationships and remember consumers revenue was up 7% year-over-year and profits were up 25%.
I think if you look at the banking book, you can really see the power it's up to sort of 3.03%, which is up 10 basis points year-over-year.
And then just bigger picture question, obviously, not just a concern for Bank of America, but as we think about exiting this year, and we just take everything at face value that rates stay here and all these other assumptions, they'll probably change but let's just hold all that and it does seem like revenue growth is going to flatten out as we get into 2020.
So we feel good just driving out more customer relationships and more loans and deposits and more wealth management business from them.
So I think our ability to continue to drive productivity is really driven by the change in customer behavior and the digital capabilities we have.
But on the other hand, what we see is right now the fundamentals of the economy in the U.S. on a global basis and the fundamentals of consumers and unemployment being low as you mentioned, means that credit is in good shape and we just don't see that changing a lot.
Yes, look I would expect low-single digit year-over-year growth to sort of continue.
Look, I just think it's good economy, and we have high quality customers in our card portfolio and they're taking some of their excess deposits and paying off the balances.
If you think about the last couple years of the economy and the last year and half in economy and commercial loan growth and I don't get the fantods all over that and that the sense itÃ¢ÂÂs things ebb and flow by what's going on.
And so I think what you saw this quarter really a combination of probably three things for us in the core commercial business, commercial loans across the board.
And then the last thing, which I think is good news to the economy overall is the line usage went up about a point in middle market which is -- which means that, that's across a lot of lines obviously, but what that really means is that people are using the creditÃ¢ÂÂs the right word.
And so, yes, the amount we rewarded our customers to do business with us, exceeded the rate of growth than their charge a little bit, but combined with their deposit balances and how they get the rewards.
You saw a consumer deposit level growth of mid-single digits, you saw $26 billion which is the size of a good bank right there, just in consumer.
Asset quality remains strong as net charge-offs remained around $1billion, the same level it have been for several quarters.
Within Global Banking, you will note that commercial customers move balances from non-interest bearing to interest bearing as a treasury credit rate we give them for their balances to pay for their services rises, they [indiscernible] with us, non-interest bearing balances.
This means middle market companies are increasing their loan activity as they draw lines to finance raw material purchases, payrolls and other investments.
However, this net benefit only partially mitigated the seasonal impact in Q1 from two less days of interest, which costs us roughly $180 million.
More specifically in Q2 typically sees higher funding of client activity in global markets related to the European dividend season, which aids trading revenue but reduces NII.
Compared to Q4 2018, expenses are up $149 million, due to seasonally elevated payroll tax expense, partially mitigated by timing of marketing and tech initiative plans.
Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to approximate this quarterÃ¢ÂÂs $1 billion level for each of the remaining quarters in 2019, assuming current economic conditions continue.
Relative to 2018, the business continued to gain momentum growing net new households, which not only added to solid AUM flows, but also drove another strong quarter of brokerage flows.
Within revenue, positive impacts from the banking activities and AUM flows were not enough to overcome lower market valuations, declines in transactional revenue and general pricing pressures.
Moving to slide 14, Q1 results reflect continued strong client engagement in both -- at both Merrill and the private bank, strong household growth in both businesses and continued low attrition of experienced financial advisors contributed to the $17 billion in overall client flows.
But primary additions remained slow and in investment grade we saw lower than expected offerings to finance share repurchases, fee pools in ECM were also down year-over-year.
Much lower market volatility this year results in less client activity and weaker performance in equity derivatives.
FICCÃ¢ÂÂs lower revenue was due to lower client activity and less favorable markets across both macro and credit related products.
On slide 22, you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remained weighted to domestic activity where fee pools are concentrated, within FICC we remain more oriented towards credit products than macro.
[Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
It seems like a steady trend down is that a customer behavior thing or has Bank of America changed anything on how it charges fees?
Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Yes, I mean at one point you mentioned something like $5 billion spent annually on storing and moving cash in check.
Our next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS.
Our next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
I guess my question is this, has the nature of credit cycles really changed due to the low rate environment?
Your next question comes from Alevizos Alevizakos with HSBC.
So those lower intangible is about $75 million per quarter.
When I look at your IB fees this quarter at least based on the results you have better come out thus far, it seems like you've slipped now to number five.
And weÃ¢ÂÂll take today's last question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
",51.52,0.7553858
boa,q2,2019,"Client activity showed $75 billion of deposit growth, a growth rate of 6% year-over-year.
A year ago, I told you weÃ¢ÂÂd continue to drive to regain our position in investment banking, as a nice start we saw market shares across many of the products, and investment bank in the first half of this year.
We use the excess capital beyond the need for growth and investments in our company to buy back shares, a trend which has accelerated and you can see on the lower left here.
Now in the recent past, from offsetting those [rate][ph] fee reductions by increasing the growth in the actual accounts, the number of accounts we have that are primary household relationships the past last few years, we have much higher retention than we've ever had and we're improving client satisfaction to levels that hasn't been seen before.
If you looked at our digital only clients, meaning customers have not used a financial center in the past year, we have 30 million consumer customers across our platform who are primarily digital, who have more than $400 billion and balances with us today.
This quarter we added another 17 financial centers to help drive the growth in our consumer business.
Assuming the economic conditions continue to move along, we think the net charge-offs should remain low for some time and we've told you that for many quarters in a row.
This is not because something we're doing in the second quarter of 2019, it's because the work we've done over the last decade to continue to maintain our risk profile on a consistent basis and drive towards it.
But we as managers you want us to be, agree with you that if there's severe economic issues ahead, we have the flexibility to continue to reshape this expense base, obviously starting with revenue related costs, which would adjust quickly and automatically and then changing our investment strategies.
Overall, compared to the end of Q1, the balance sheet grew $19 billion driven by loan growth, which ended the quarter more than $20 billion higher in our business segments.
Global Banking continued to benefit from strong customer demand, reflecting the additional bankers we have deployed over the last few years in the middle market franchise.
Within that, Global Wealth Management was up $18 billion year-over-year reflecting client growth with a preference to hold cash amid market uncertainty as well as inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds to deposits near the end of 2018.
Consumer banking deposits grew by $19 billion or 3% year-over-year.
Looking at loans across our business segments, core loans grew $34 billion or 4% year-over-year.
Growth of loans to consumers was led by an increase in mortgages, as lower interest rates stimulated more originations, and allowed many of our customers to lower the cost of owning their existing home or buying a new one.
In the second half of the year, we expect an NII to benefit from growth in loans and deposits, as well as an additional day of interest in Q3.
Turning to expenses on slide 12, we have now been pacing at our targeted level of non-interest expense for several quarters, and our efficiency ratio has improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 57%.
Absent this recovery, net charge-offs were just over $1 billion or 43 basis points of average loans and consistent with the net loss of rate ratio in Q1 and the prior year quarter.
Turning to the business segments, and starting with consumer banking on Slide 15, consumer banking produced another strong quarter earnings grew 13% year-over-year to $3.3 billion.
Even as we invest in new markets and renovate financial centers, the all-in 162 basis point cost of running the deposit franchise was relatively flat compared to Q2 2018 as the decline in the cost of deposits component offset the increase in rates paid.
The business created 240 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year as revenue increased more than 3% and expenses grew 1%.
On the banking side, deposits of $254 billion were up $18 million or 7% year-over-year driven by client growth and the desire by some clients to hold more cash amid the market uncertainty.
Loans were 3% higher year-over-year reflecting strong mortgage growth given the decline in rates.
Looking at them on a separate basis and beginning with global banking on slide 19, the business earned $1.9 billion and generated a 19% return on allocated capital in the quarter.
Strong deposit and loan growth reflects hundreds of bankers we've added as well as continued investments and how we deliver our loan product and treasury services.
Looking at trends in slide 20 and comparing to Q2 last year, as you heard Brian mentioned earlier, we have made steady progress in investment banking over the last few quarters.
And given the strong loan growth you guys have seen kind of accelerated in 2Q, is there enough asset growth that you can still grow NII in this environment next year?
I guess the crude approximation is the $3 billion impact over the 12 months of a 100 basis points down rate shock on the short end.
Remember, if you think about the industry's thought process over the last three years basically as rates rose, that was one thought process and how people price deposits and other things, and as that changes you'll see a different thought process take hold at least in our company.
And I think if you look at some of the statistics in the material on the Ã¢ÂÂ especially on the corporate GTS type business that the necessary increase for the highest balanced customers et cetera, that's occurred, will slow down and come back the other way and that frankly is just the nature of a change in the rate environment which the pricing is still catching up to.
And how you know that it's going to continue to fuel that growth maybe something a little bit more of growth coming from current customer base versus new ones, things like that?
What has really happened in our card business over the last few years has been, they continue repositioning it, it's really over now and now you're starting to see it start to work its way up and grow just in terms of balances and numbers of cards and things like that.
Although it still going to hit, but you're seeing that help fuel our deposit growth and checking deposits especially 6% year-over-year in consumer and that is a huge payback for the reward price.
But the industry dynamics and how people are using rewards not only for the card activity but also more broadly as I don't expect to change, but in the Bank of America context we've been using it for the broadest part of the franchise and that's why you see the good growth in the other parts of the business.
I was intrigued by your comment about 16 million millennial customers, $200 billion of deposits and I think that's the first time that you've disclosed that information.
One of the things and I don't want to sound perspicacious in terms of people's use the big banks, don't do business with millennials, it just to set the tone, we put the 16 million to give you [in one sense] [ph], it's $400 billion of client balances with us.
And going back to the comments on the page 6 of the slide deck on consumer strategies, just look of the activity levels and those are generally would have a stronger cohort to younger below 40-year-old people.
But if you look at it with Zelle, the activity volumes if you look at with Erica in the year, 50 million plus customer interactions and if you look at it in terms of digital interaction at 2.3 billion in the quarter, mobile log-ins 1.5 billion.
And also the 2% reported has closed some of the gap to that core number, I guess, as you think about the run down pace, could we continue to see a narrowing, so that your overall balance sheet growth looks closer to that core?
And the last thing is think about in the Merrill side in terms of -- in the private banking side in terms of loan growth we're seeing solid performance there and the integration in middle market investment bank and we feel good.
Brian, and then you touched on this a little bit, but could you talk about your feelings or your ability to maintain the strong checking account growth that you've had given the stance on rates paid.
You mentioned, I know its crude approximation, but 25 basis point cut on the short end, it's about $175 million a quarter, but that's just the banking book and your liability sensitive in your trading book.
When you look at those disclosures about the impact of a 100 basis point shock on the down rate scenario on the short end, remember, that's below the forward curve.
And you know remember when I went through the script and talk about how that we'll still end up growing year-over-year 2019 versus 2018, you get a factor in loan and deposit growth.
I think this is a result of all the things that we said we were going to do, not that we ever had a problem in investment banking, but we think we should be top three and there was a little bit of slippage there.
Also maybe you speak to some of the doctors that are driving more benign impact in terms of the rate sensitivity that you cited versus what explicitly disclosed in the 10-Q whether it's volume growth, some issues relating to your comparing it versus the forward curve, deposit offsets or anything else you can speak to?
And so sometimes people get confused by that because they think its from the current rate and by stable rate environment we see today minus 100, its actually in the case of forward curve having the rest of the year two cuts and its 50 off and then another 100 off.
On top of that you've got to factor in when long term interest rates go down, the quarter later or the month later you're going to see an impact.
But right now, we think 2019 is going to come in a couple of hundred million under what we said, which just goes -- by the teammates here is good management.
So again, the way to think about it, and I'll give you a little bit more detail, but just to get the concept down, we've got GWIM clients, we've got Global Banking clients that pass-through rate on an up-and-down scenario of roughly similar, and we've got a consumer franchise where we have not passed through a lot of rate increase in the former rate paid.
So if you look at the pass-through rate and the down scenario an average we're talking approximately 40%, and again, consumer would be a lot lower, GWIM and Global Banking would be a lot higher kind of in that 60%, 65% range.
Going back to the mobile and digital trends which you're obviously really strong, but looking backwards over the last several quarters, your tax spend has been pretty flat, and you mentioned that tax spend is likely to increase.
And if you think about that, if you add that in the cost of deposit repaid, you're basically flat year-over-year and the total cost of goods sold for lack of a better term to produce this wonderful transaction franchise and consumer and further the loans franchise on top of it and the investment franchise on top of that.
But you think of the run rate exiting 2019 at that level and you can add two more quarters to it, but loan growth, deposit growth, whether the cut comes, when it comes, those are all factors in there.
So I think Paul said, we'll talk about that next quarter when we know a little bit more.
As we look to your -- to your supplement disclosure, then I think we're looking at as a U.S. interest bearing deposit rate going up 4 basis points from 73 to 77.
GUM I think was relatively flat and in global banking, when you have a mix shift, you're going to see more deposits go in to the interest bearing, you going to see an increase in the overall deposit rate of company.
Remember, it really is a question of looking into different businesses, because consumers are checking growing growth 41 consecutive quarters, so that you know that you should expect the trends there to continue like we said earlier in the call were -- were the institutional business in the global banking business.
I don't want to be stubborn here, but you've got to remember that you back up and think about it $70 billion of deposit growth all a hugely advantaged cost to fund all the core customers is what we drive in this, in one part of our business here.
People always forget about that that's the offset to the NII debate with lower rates going forward as the current long term securities you have are worth more and we invest every quarter about half treasuries and half mortgage backs in those treasuries are now advantaged when from the last whatever period of time.
We do not see anything that says, the U.S. consumer and our business is spending 5% more plus than they did last year for the second quarter.
Yes, thanks Lee and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results.
However, we saw in our client base during the second quarter 2019 with solid consumer activity pointing to a continued growing economy in the United States this year albeit at a slower pace.
We generate operating leverage of more than 200 basis points; our credit costs remained low and stable, so that resulted in year-over-year net income growing 8%, and during the past year we bought back 7% of our shares, this reflects the model of combining solid operations with strong capital returns and then thereby driving strong core EPS growth.
In those 18 quarters, you've seen many different market environments; changes in interest rates, economic growth has sped up or slowed down, but we still manage to drive operating leverage for four and a half years and successively.
But importantly on Slide 7, we'll talk about how that impact is now being driven across our corporate and global transaction services business.
Number one, many of you asked, what -- what we see if the expected forward yield curve comes true, i.e. The third question is, okay, given an environment where you may see a slowdown in economy do you have further expense levers to pull?
Paul is going to talk to you about near-term expense guidance a little later, but importantly, the reason why you're investing is to produce these investments presumably meaning result -- meaningful results.
Shareholders' equity increased $4.4 billion as we issued $2.4 billion in preferred stock ahead of planned calls announced in July, and common equity increased 2 billion, versus Q1, the $2 billion dollar increase in common equity reflects an increase in AOCI as the value of our AFS debt securities rose given the decline in loan and interest rates.
Moving to client activity and starting with average deposits on Slide nine, average deposits grew nearly $75 billion or 6% year-over-year.
Within global banking, we saw increased activity for middle market clients, complementing the continued activity from large global corporate borrowers.
First, lower long term rates resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage backed securities, which cause higher write-offs of bond premiums.
Second, Q2 included higher funding costs from growth in non-earning trading assets and other global markets assets.
The lower current forward curve also caused increased asset sensitivity in the falling rate scenario.
Second, lower long term rates may continue to stimulate mortgage refinancingÃ¢ÂÂs causing increased right off of bond premiums, and third reinvestment rates on securities and mortgages will dilute current portfolio yields.
If rates follow the forward curve, and the Fed funds rate were indeed to be cut twice this year starting this month, we think it would likely shave another 1% off NII growth for 2019.
Investment in people included adding more sales professionals, increased merit and benefit, as well as the shared success bonuses which we have awarded for two consecutive years now, since a portion of shares of tax bonuses best -- best over time we are now covering those programs and our ongoing expense base.
We expect increased technology investment in the second half plus the cost of adding new client facing professionals to be roughly offset by the seasonally lower incentive costs.
As you know, the industry received annual stress test results this quarter and once again our loss rates in stress scenarios were lower than our major peers.
Client activity remained strong with loans and deposits showing solid growth.
Customer satisfaction improved, asset quality remains strong as a net charge-off ratio was 124 basis points, decreasing 4 basis points year-over-year.
We continue to expect higher rewards to dampen card income, but would also remind you, that we use awards to deepen relationships with a focus on total customer revenue not just fees.
Turning to Global Wealth & Investment Management on slide 17 strong results were driven by new investment accounts and more traditional banking products, as well as the markets rebound in the quarter.
Within revenue, positive impacts from banking activities and higher rates drove NII higher while fee improvements from AUM flows and market valuations more than offset general pricing pressures.
With respect to expenses, higher revenue related incentives as well as continued investment in new advisors, technology and brand were modestly offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs.
Digital use by affluent clients continues to gain momentum as mobile usage once again grew double digits year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 18, GWIM results reflect continued solid client engagement in both Merrill and the private bank.
This quarter we had nearly 15,000 referrals, two advisors from other parts of the company and advisors made more than 58,000 referrals back to our other LOBs. In Q2 these introductions added 7 billion to client balances in GWIMs and help us grow households.
With respect to expenses, lower deposit insurance cost mostly offset continued investment in technology and bankers.
Fixed lower revenue was due to a weaker trading environment with lower overall client activity across most products.
The 2% year-over-year expense decline was a reflection of lower revenue- related compensation.
On slide 22, you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remains heavily weighted to domestic activity where global fee pools are centered.
Within FICC, revenue mix remained weighted towards credit products and we have no days with trading losses in the quarter.
We make sure that they get executed on the [capital] [ph] success rate, and that energy creates Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs gold in every market every year and this year we will do 7 million referrals across all the businesses in the markets that we're doing.
So if you look at the Ã¢ÂÂ what we're seeing now is the average balance in our checking accounts I think are $7.57 billion Ã¢ÂÂ seven point five thousand, seven and half thousand, seven point 7 some like that.
I don't think we're prepared to give too much guidance on how liability sensitive the trading book is, but when you put all the factors together you kind of get to roughly 100 basis points, I mean, 100 million on the first rate cut.
Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
So I guess, question is like on a stable environment your base case, what you thinking on costs?
And would expect that mix shift to continue going forward?
And our last question today is a follow up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

boa,q3,2019,"The investments we have been making in the franchise for many years and our disciplined responsible growth approach are evident across every line of business results in respective customer basis you'll see in the materials.
On the consumer business on the left hand side of the slide, our deposit growth has consistently been above the average Ã¢ÂÂ the industry average for many periods.
We have been investing in the client facing teammates in our commercial banking for a few years, and we've increased our investment banking coverage, especially in the middle market and we've added new traders and sales staff in Europe as we opened our Paris brokerage office.
Deposits with our consumers grew $38 billion in total or 4% reflecting the value clients place on the relationship benefits offered by the convenience of our network, the value of our leading digital capabilities and our unique preferred rewards program.
Global wealth manager was responsible for $16 billion of that $38 billion in consumer deposit growth, reflecting client expansion and preference to hold cash and move investments as well as inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds and deposits at year-end 2018.
Since the end of 2015, our average consumer banking deposits are up $145 billion in balances, three quarters of that coming from checking accounts.
Now, when you look at global banking in the lower right-hand side of the slide, $23 billion in deposit growth reflects a rising rate environment and the additional bankers we have deployed over the last few years to continue to sell our superior global transaction services, capabilities.
Part of that is to have sustainable growth, which it means we self fund our investments and find ways to handle the inflationary cost to keep expenses relatively flat, while we continue to invest heavily, $3 billion in technology, new branches, new team mates.
So we've been able to operate at $53 billion annualized expense base, despite increased investments in technology and infrastructure and buildings and people and philanthropy and other costs.
The year-over-year improvement reflects solid loan and deposit growth as well as modestly higher average short-term rates year-over-year.
Offsetting these negative impacts were one additional day of interest, loan and deposit growth, reduction in the cost of our long-term debt and a small decline in the interest rate paid on deposits.
At the same time, we lowered the rates on interest bearing deposits by 5 basis points to 76 basis points, roughly half of our $1.37 trillion deposit book in our consumer banking businesses, where our customer pricing remained relatively unchanged, while the deposit rate we pay in global banking and wealth management declined 12 basis points versus Q2.
However, LIBOR rates have reduced the cost of our long-term debt and the funding of our Global Markets business, this plus loan and deposit growth are expected to partially offset the headwinds.
Our investments in this business continued at a steady pace and client activity remained strong with respect to loan and deposit growth, as well as consumer spending.
Again this quarter, we added salespeople expanded in new and existing markets, renovated financial centers and improved capabilities for consumers, as well as small businesses.
And even as we continue to invest, the cost of deposit year-over-year declined to 150 basis points nearly offsetting the increase in rate paid, which is now 11 basis points.
Strong results were aided by growth across AUM, loans and deposits and generally good market conditions in the quarter.
On the banking side, average deposits of $254 billion were up $16 billion or 7% year-over-year driven by client growth and 2018 year-end conversion of balances from money market funds.
Strong deposit and loan growth reflects the benefits of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years, as well as continued advancements in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services.
In Q3, we continue to add regional investment bankers with a focus on expanding our geographic coverage in the U.S. to match our coverage model and market leadership and commercial banking across the U.S. One of the reasons for growth in deposits and Global Banking has been our consistent investment over multiple years and digital capabilities within our transaction services platform.
The improvement in equities to $1.15 billion was driven by growth in client facing activities as well as continued Ã¢ÂÂ as well as we continue to invest in our equity financing products.
I know thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot of moving parts, but given the forward curve and maybe you could also help us think about the premium amortization year-to-date, what that drag has been and how that would play out in a stable rate environment from here.
So, let me start with the premium amortization, if Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂm not going to give you any precise number, but if you think about the extra day we had from Q2 to Q3, the increase in premium amortization in the quarter more than offset that.
I think, we have Ã¢ÂÂ if you go back many quarters ago, we discussed -- our thought process is to tell our teammates to price to achieve sustainable deposit growth of 3% or more faster than the economy, which means you are in axiomatic point there as youÃ¢ÂÂre gaining share at all times if economy is growing less.
On the commercial side, the changes of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing and the fees for services and all that stuff, calculations change, but IÃ¢ÂÂd say you should expect us to continue to grow at the rate weÃ¢ÂÂre growing now or faster because frankly, weÃ¢ÂÂve been very disciplined about how weÃ¢ÂÂve been driving.
It gets core checking accounts on the consumer side, core checking and savings accounts on the wealth management business, and obviously GTS business, and so IÃ¢ÂÂd expect it to continue to grow maybe faster, 3%, 4%, and 5%, but the thing about that is Ã¢ÂÂ that is incredible amounts of new customers at very advantaged price and that we can put to work .
So, are you willing to go to negative operating leverage or with the investments like, we have the new sales people in the branches and you had more deposit growth.
And so, if this quarter we are sort of flattish on operating leverage, if we happen to go negative IÃ¢ÂÂd argue, and that was the right thing to do based on everything weÃ¢ÂÂre assessing at the time you do it.
But the real key is back to your Ã¢ÂÂ sort of your second question, which is we are getting the benefits of sustained long-term investment, and the change the way this company operates that continues to push through.
And so thatÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ three, four years out, youÃ¢ÂÂre saying how can you plan out with all the investments weÃ¢ÂÂre making.
But as you think about technology spend and incremental bill costs I would Ã¢ÂÂ thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be prioritized within our normal $3 billion or plus a year that weÃ¢ÂÂre investing.
If you look across those segments, especially in small business, and importantly in Business Banking and Global Commercial Banking, Ather Williams, who runs Business Banking and Alastair Borthwick, those guys have been investing in headcount and people and relationship manager and Ã¢ÂÂ precise number for each of them.
So I think itÃ¢ÂÂs sustainable and mid-single digits, maybe 6% a little higher, maybe 5%, maybe 4%, maybe 6%, if economy is a 2%, but this taking market share, because of the deployment of the capabilities into the middle market and business banking franchise is along with some of the work thatÃ¢ÂÂs going on now with investment banking and others is a good place to be.
There are some differences to the 10-Q disclosure you mentioned prior, like itÃ¢ÂÂs only the banking book, itÃ¢ÂÂs relative to the forward curve, how should we needle that and think about what one rate cut, if weÃ¢ÂÂre going to model that going forward.
But when you look at them, youÃ¢ÂÂre going to see that, over the next Ã¢ÂÂ but if the Fed were to cut rates by 25 basis points.
But itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a little bit less of that, because again that forward curve includes three rate cuts and then youÃ¢ÂÂre talking about 100 basis points on top of that.
And in fact, there has been more rate cuts and weÃ¢ÂÂre still holding the same guidance of $12 billion in change and stats shows you that weÃ¢ÂÂre managing the heck to try to avoid some of these impacts and how weÃ¢ÂÂd price deposits and better growth in deposits when you may have estimated that.
The one Ã¢ÂÂ it seems like obviously third quarter is a little bit better than maybe expected and youÃ¢ÂÂre retaining the 1% growth in kind of implies, $12 billion for the fourth quarter.
And on the deposit cost side, you did Ã¢ÂÂ I mean obviously, interest bearing deposit costs were down 5 basis points, and it seems like thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be given the limited scope in retail, wealth and commercial, youÃ¢ÂÂre being proactive there as you should, but youÃ¢ÂÂre coming from a lower starting point on deposit cost the most of your competitors to begin with.
YouÃ¢ÂÂre largely around all the CCAR stuff, but ultimately in some of the work we are doing, but really to get all the data rates actually the parts and things that can operate are operating on good data and that investment then allows us to take advantage of it and weÃ¢ÂÂre still in the early days, quotes that we invested in the markets business, so itÃ¢ÂÂs from one side of the company, the other.
The way we do AML, KYC refreshes Ã¢ÂÂ weÃ¢ÂÂre going to recognize the team that took a several 100,000 hours out of, several 1,000 hours out of the work to do that, itÃ¢ÂÂs just a 1,000 things.
Yes, I think itÃ¢ÂÂs just Ã¢ÂÂ the third quarter was just a little bit of timing.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre increasing our investment in people in financial centers, in marketing, but itÃ¢ÂÂs not even throughout the whole year.
Our loan and deposit growth, above industry averages and above the market on a conservatively responsible growth basis continues to help offset the NII pressure due to rate changes which is Ã¢ÂÂ which all of you are focused on, it should be.
Excluding that charge, third quarter net income was a record $7.5 billion after-tax and EPS of $0.75 per share.
So, before Paul dives into the quarter's results through the lines of business, I wanted to cover a little bit about client activity costs and operating leverage at an enterprise level.
Our total commercial loans grew 6% compared to the third quarter of 2018 with good middle market utilization rates.
This is the fourth year of good growing net checking households after a decade of consolidation of accounts.
Now through a renewed focus on growth in our wealth management franchise, Andy Sieg and Katy Knox are leading the charge, and we've seen net new Merrill Lynch and private banking relationships, up over 30% plus in each case.
Paul is going to cover the continued growth in digital uses across our client base, which provides an important dual benefit of strong customer service and lower cost structures.
Earlier this quarter, my teammate, Tom Montag highlighted some of the gains we are making in middle market investment banking coverage at a conference.
One additional point we'd focus on here is a long-term trend of deposit growth even in a moving rate environment.
Within consumer, you'll note that strong residential mortgage growth, but also the more stable credit card balances, which reflect our decision last year to continue to manage less profitable promotional balances down or driving core balances and our relationship, especially in preferred rewards capabilities.
Despite the immediate revenue impact of a lower interest rate environment and other revenue challenges with a slowing economy, we have a good track record of generating operational savings, we're able to keep it operating leverage relatively flat, essentially expenses and revenue grew about $500 million Ã¢ÂÂ less than $500 million each.
As I've said before, generating operating leverage does get tougher when we told you that over the last several quarters, after four successful years of keeping expenses, declining and holding relatively flat.
We also grew the balance sheet in Global Markets to support additional client activity.
As positive OCI from lower rates and net income totaling $7 billion was more than offset by $9 billion of capital return to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases.
Our risk-weighted assets increased modestly as a result of increased client activity and higher loan balances across the businesses.
While NII improved in Global Markets, results are better assessed by studying together, both NII and trading account profits as client activity from one quarter to the next can shift in mix between these two revenue lines.
Looking forward, on our Q2 earnings call, we reviewed our expectation that net interest income could grow roughly 1% for the full year of 2019 over 2018.
Consumer non-performing loans declined as a result of the loan sales and in commercial, ratios tracking non-performing loans and reservable credit size exposure remained near historic lows.
The low long-term rate environment continued to generate momentum and consumer real estate as new originations nearly doubled from last year to more than $20 billion.
Consumer investment assets grew $19 billion to $223 billion, a strong client flows were partially offset by market declines.
The business created nearly 300 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year, as revenue increased 2% while expenses declined 1%.
Within revenue, positive impacts from growth in deposits and loans drove NII higher asset management fees grew year-over-year as fees from AUM flows and market valuations more than offset general pricing pressures.
Moving to Slide 16, GWIM results reflect continued solid client engagement in both Merrill and the private bank.
As you heard Brian mentioned earlier and Tom discussed at an investor conference last month, we have made steady progress in investment banking over the past year.
A few other items impacted results here, first provision benefit from the recoveries totaling $200 million related to the sale of primary non-core consumer real estate loans totaling $1.8 billion.
In terms of, but going forward, unless long-end rates fall meaningfully from here, we wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt expect that level of increase in premium amortization in Q4 even next year without significant increases Ã¢ÂÂ significant decrease among the rates.
You had good commercial across the consumer franchise broadly whether itÃ¢ÂÂs wealth or traditional banking.
So, whatÃ¢ÂÂs your confidence in growing revenues faster than expenses over the next year, even though youÃ¢ÂÂre not giving specific guidance, but more generally, whatÃ¢ÂÂs the role of technology inside the firm thatÃ¢ÂÂs enabling this operating leverage?
Yes. But I think 25% more bankers today than there were three years ago, which gave us an opportunity to divide the portfolios of clients further.
I just would point out that we really manage that business looking at total sales and trading revenue not NII.
Is it just that loan growth is coming in better youÃ¢ÂÂve been able to reprice deposits a little bit faster?
On the wealth management side, weÃ¢ÂÂre driving not only the investment cash, but all the transactional cash and you have to think of those as two separate executions and putting teammates investing by putting teammates into the Merrill Lynch offices who can help the client associates and others who have always done a good job, doing better job of getting core checking relationships and mortgages and things like that, which will help.
Hey guys, just a quick one, Brian, you mentioned that obviously delivering positive operating leverage gets harder with their Ã¢ÂÂ and rate environment where it is, but as you look ahead and youÃ¢ÂÂve done this good job of keeping this $53 billion or so, what are the incremental things that become more productive underneath that allows you to fund the incremental investments, like do we transition to other parts of the business becoming more productive or other pieces that you havenÃ¢ÂÂt Ã¢ÂÂ maybe still havenÃ¢ÂÂt yet attacked that could still provide that underlying support.
Our next question will come from Matt OÃ¢ÂÂConnor from Deutsche Bank.
As you think about the overall balance sheet should that grow in line with deposits or are there some opportunities to bring down debt and youÃ¢ÂÂll see a little bit less earning asset growth?
You had good numbers in your investment banking area this quarter and are taking some wallet share.
",45.02,0.74353606
boa,q4,2019,"We also have to manage our cost base carefully, while making the required investments, and we have to take advantage of a strong balance sheet to provide good capital return to our shareholders.
We completed more than $3 billion in new technology code initiatives last year, building on years of investments in award-winning digital and mobile capabilities to serve our clients better and help our teammates to be more efficient.
This powerful combination of Global Banking, Global Markets generated $11.6 billion in after tax net income this year.
With a renewed focus, our investment banking team regained some of the lost market share from a couple of years ago, and Paul will give you those numbers later.
We saw solid loan demand in our commercial client base throughout the year, but that moderated in the second half of the year as worries about global economic uncertainty and all the issues that are talked about every day dragged on.
Client activity remained solid, allowing the benefits of loan and deposit growth to aid in offsetting the negative impact of lower short-term rates over the past three quarters.
Overall compared to the end of Q3, the balance sheet was relatively flat at $2.4 trillion as growth of both loans and securities was modestly offset by lower Global Market assets.
Consumer Banking deposits grew $33 billion or 5%, as we believe customers value the convenience of our financial centers and ATM networks, leading online and mobile capabilities, and our unique preferred reward program.
Global Banking deposits grew $19 billion or 5% year-over-year, and reflected both our strong GTS platform, and the additional bankers we have deployed over the past couple of years.
On the other hand, in Global Banking and Wealth Management, the decline from Q3 and the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, was more in line with the 38 basis point drop in average one-month LIBOR.
Looking forward, as we move into 2020, let me start by saying, our expectations assume a stable economic and interest rate environment, i.e. flat rates relative to the end of the year.
Given those assumptions, we expect NII in Q1 to be lower than Q4, as the benefits of loan and deposit growth will be more than offset by three things.
From there, we would expect NII to rise modestly in the second half of the year, driven by an additional day of interest and continued loan and deposit growth.
We expect our full-year expense to be in the low $53 billion range this year and as long as client activity and the economic environment remains stable, our investment plans will likely remain unchanged.
Consumer Banking produced another solid quarter of revenue and earnings, but was heavily impacted by lower rates in the second half of 2019.
Strong results were led by growth across AUM, loans and deposits, as well as good market conditions in the quarter, but also reflected the headwinds of lower interest rates.
With $256 billion in deposits, this segment would rank standalone as the seventh or eighth largest bank in the U.S. So when rates fall, GWIM feels it, but much of the impact of foreign rates was offset by advisory fees, generated from our industry-leading Wealth Management platform.
Net income was just over $1 billion, down 4% from Q4 2018, reflecting lower interest rates and the absence of a prior year gain from the sale of a non-core asset, which also impacted the revenue comparisons.
Continued strong deposit and loan growth reflects the benefit of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years, increasing our client coverage, as well as continued advancement in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services.
Bank of America was involved in seven of the Top 10 debt deals, and six of the Top 10 equity deals in the quarter, based upon Dealogic data this performance drove a 50 basis point improvement in market share for the full-year.
One of the reasons for the growth in deposits and Global Banking has been our consistent investment over multiple years in digital capabilities and transaction services.
Global Markets produced $639 million of earnings, year-over-year revenue was up 10%, from both higher sales and trading results, and improved investment banking fees.
And then how are you feeling Ã¢ÂÂ I guess if we think about positive operating leverage for this year, you mentioned the stability in expenses while you continue to invest.
As I said though, assuming a more stable rate environment, we would expect NII to return to growth in the second half of 2020 driven by loan and deposit growth.
We are focused on the things that we can control like driving like client activity, deposits, loans, investments, and efficiency improvements through our focus on operational excellence.
So if things change, we'll adjust, but currently we feel our client activity and market share gains continue to support our investment plans in the near term.
I think it's more a reflection of responsible growth, and how we run, how we're focused on the customer, and how we're focused on total revenue, and not necessarily NII or fees.
I think what you see though, if you look at our risk-adjusted margin, that's up 25 basis points year-over-year to 8.7% if you adjust out the 4Q gains we had last year, and we continue to have more than million cards each month again with a focus on profitability of new accounts.
I think, Glenn, just to be Ã¢ÂÂ with Paul's lost point Ã¢ÂÂ production of new customers taking the card product from us and the usage continues to grow, so we had 1 million plus new cardholders.
So if rates stable here from here, then the loan-to-deposit growth, which have been strong will then pick up that, and that's very leveraged to the margin Ã¢ÂÂ contribute to the margin.
So you're working Ã¢ÂÂ it's pretty good to make $0.60 Ã¢ÂÂ 60% of your margin after comp, and we're not changing the comp system, but there's a lot of things forward, and I think we can continue to improve them.
It would appear to be easier or if, in fact, rates stay stable and drive loan growth, which is what our projection is, and if rates start rising again, we will look like heroes in terms of margin, but we've been able to sustain it even in a falling rate environment.
Loan deposit account growth, as you noted, Paul and Brian, continues to track very well.
And I'm just wondering, as we prepare for CECL, does that inform your appetite or your willingness to continue down the same path, and just separately, just given the strength of your credit position and a relatively clean balance sheet, was sort of hoping you guys could be CECL pioneers, and maybe the first bank to provide some more concrete guidance, in terms of day two provision impacts or expectations?
When you're doing $60 billion in deposit growth and your loan balances grew by $10 billion or $20 billion, the other half has to go to be invested somewhere and you're raising this money in all-in costs in the 40 basis points of deposit pricing across the whole board, and a lot of it's coming in non-interest.
Can you give us a sense, as to how you see the rate of change go from here, because we've had obviously significant improvement in the consumer side, and the question I get from people is, is it over and by the way, how do you generate positive operating leverage in global banks and global markets, given the SKU to producers, and is there that much opportunity in the back office side?
As you know though, that's a market price business, so that you always fighting the revenue changes at the same time and in fact, if you look at most of this from four, five years ago, we actually had the same amount of trading profits we had then.
And by the time you get to the third quarter, we would expect, assuming the current sort of economic environment, we would expect our loan and deposit growth, the lack of that seasonality, the deposit pricing to have an effect and we'll start growing again.
How do we think about when, in the current rate environment, the sort of net interest margin, assuming mix is unchanged, obviously it's a big assumption, but do we assume that NIM starts to stabilize in the second half of this year?
I think if you look at Page 9, when you have rate movement due to the types of things that are Ã¢ÂÂ reestablish the reserve levels by the Federal Reserve, et cetera, et cetera that's going to affect the lower Ã¢ÂÂ our markets business in the lower right hand, and banking, stuff like that.
So one of the things that just in our efficiency ratio compared to other people or 58% for the year, but remember that we have a lot more wealth management at 30% Ã¢ÂÂ or 28%, 29% profit, pre-tax margin i.e. That changes that answer relative to some of our core banking peers.
If you look across the chart, Paul showed you when you see 2017, 2018 and 2019 in the expenses per quarter running $13.1 billion, $13.3 billion et cetera, think about how much we've done in there, in terms of hundreds of new branches.
So we're spending that much on technology, but the question isn't spend, Mike, it's are you getting the usage out of it, and that's where you got to look at things like the usage of Zelle, which we're going to 80%, 90% a year, the use of the cash per mobile which grew over 100% a year that usage what I talked about in checks written coming down.
You could, it'd just be not the right thing to do for the Company, but it's paid for by the other Ã¢ÂÂ the cost takeout that supports or the mix in how the customer uses, which provides efficiencies, so more than 50% of our auto loans are originated digitally today.
The only thing that works against that is Ã¢ÂÂ so yes, if you thought about how much is going to sort of new business initiatives, the mobile banking, feature functionality, it's higher in 2020 than it was in 2019 than it was in 2018, largely around this issue that you are running off some of these long-term projects, which is good.
We continue to be well-positioned here in driving market share gains with great service and capabilities.
These savings generated by operational excellence also enable us to make capital investments in our company of $1.7 billion during 2019 for newer modernized facilities and other related priorities.
Dean Athanasia and the consumer team generated impressive $13 billion in after tax earnings in our consumer and small business group by driving responsible growth.
They continue to provide real value for clients through innovative products and services, while driving improvements in upgraded facilities, entering new markets and driving innovation.
Consumers record level efficiency and customer satisfaction scores reflect our hard work done the right way.
EPS increased 6% from Q4 2018 reflecting modestly lower earnings more than offset by a 9% reduction in average diluted shares.
Our risk weighted assets increased modestly from consumer loan growth and increased Global Banking exposures.
Looking at how client activity impacted average balances, let's start with deposits on Slide 9.
I would also note the stability of credit card balances, which reflects our decision last year to pull back on less profitable promotional balances, as we continue to prioritize sustainable long-term profitability.
The benefits of loan and deposit growth coupled with disciplined pricing mostly offset the impact across short-term rates of a linked quarter 47 basis point decline in the average Fed funds rate.
Moving to Q2, we typically experience seasonally lower NII for two reasons; first, we typically see higher interest expense from funding, increased seasonal Global Markets client activity in equities.
Turning to Slide 12 and quarterly expenses over the past two years; at $13.2 billion this quarter, expenses were 1% higher than Q4 2018, as increased investments throughout 2019 in people, real estate and technology initiatives were largely offset by savings from operational excellence and lower amortization of intangibles.
With respect to headcount, year-over-year savings from improved processes and workflows allowed us to fund an increase in the number of sales professionals, as our LOBs added nearly 4,000 associates over the past 12 months.
I will quickly note continued positive trends across deposits, loans and investments, all of which I touched upon earlier.
Digital channels generated 27% of overall sales, 34% of mortgages and 56% of client direct auto loans originated through our mobile app or online banking site.
Expenses decreased slightly, as investments in sales professionals technology and our brand were more than offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs.
And deposit flows were modestly negative, as clients shifted cash back into investments during the year, following the 4Q 2018 equity market declines.
An 8% decline in net income was driven by lower NII and higher investments costs, which outpaced the improvement from investment banking income and leasing related gains.
These investments will continue to benefit the franchise for many years to come, as new bankers deepen existing relationships and add new ones.
Looking at trends on Slide 21 and comparing to Q4 last year.
Despite Ã¢ÂÂ double-digit increases in both debt and equity underwriting fees, led the year-over-year improvement.
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
And just given some of the moderating U.S. and global GDP growth expectations you cited earlier, just trying to think about how we should be modeling or forecasting fee income expectations in the coming years?
So I think that Steven, a guy like me who has been around banks for a long time, the differentiation between types of revenue fee versus spread is becoming harder as the business models have morphed them together in just terms of total revenue.
Brian, 10 years of excellent management here driving the bus on improving operating leverage, especially over the past three, four years?
I think you mentioned a couple of times that NII expectation for 2020 being down modestly from 2019 for your full-year.
I guess how do you think about the deposit growth, and if there Ã¢ÂÂ if we could see continued sort of above mid single-digit growth?
Every business had good client activity.

boa,q1,2020,"As you think about our quarter, our decade plus long discipline of responsible growth has resulted in us strengthening our balance sheet and making investments in technology and people and talent over the decade has helped us prepare for this environment.
This included building our loan loss reserve by $3.6 billion over charge-offs and thatÃ¢ÂÂs due to the economic deterioration of the global economy as a result of the virus.
I think itÃ¢ÂÂs useful to draw your attention to the pretax pre-provision income line, as we believe it helps illustrate the underlying earnings power of the company to support the credit costs that are inevitable in a downturn.
Global Markets clientÃ¢ÂÂs needs for liquidity temporarily increased our balance sheet during the quarter by as much as $130 billion from year end, but through the efforts of Tom Montag and team we ended the quarter marginally up.
Small Business originations not from any of the special programs were $2.4 billion during this quarter, showing support for that segment of the economy.
At the same time, we returned $7.9 billion in capital to our shareholders, and as you know, during the quarter, we voluntary chose to suspend the buyback portion of those distributions to share capital for expected customer growth.
Many of our teammates are on the front lines of this effort, including daily engagement with clients, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs in our financial centers which remain open, financial advisors guiding their clients through the turbulent times or the capital and liquidity we are providing the companies across the businesses.
Overall, a couple months ago in a healthy U.S. economy, payments were running at a high single-digit, in fact, in some cases, a low double-digit percentage increase over the same period prior of 2020 January and February versus 2019 January and February.
In total, we saw $67 billion increase in commercial loans due to draws from the commercial clients in the month of March.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs worth noting since we have one of the premier global treasury service platforms of the world, we saw many of those draws come back and our balance sheet as deposits, whether 75% of the loan draws were not used for other pay-downs ended up as deposits with our company.
In fact, itÃ¢ÂÂs the 28th quarter of the last 29 that we have had year-over-year growth at $20 billion or more in Consumer Banking deposits.
Wealth Management deposits reflect a flight to cash in the first quarter, but have been stabilizing last year, as you can see in the charts Paul will show you later.
As Brian mentioned, the team did an incredible job of not only providing our Global Markets clients needed liquidity from a mid-March spike, but also reducing those levels by the end of the quarter.
Before I discuss our forward view of NII, I want to emphasize that future NII results will be influenced by interest rates, as well as loan and deposit balances, which will likely be highly influenced by the virusÃ¢ÂÂ impact on the economy.
As you think about our NII for the rest of the year, I would point you to the asset sensitivity disclosure for our banking book at 12/31 before we experienced these rate declines.
Considering all these factors, particularly the virusÃ¢ÂÂ impact on the economy and interest rates, we believe NII could approach $11 billion in Q2 and then begin to stabilize with loan and deposit growth mitigating the negative impacts of longer term asset repricing.
As you all know, what really impacts banks in a recession is not the loans put on your books during stress, but rather the quality of your portfolio booked during the years leading up to stress.
Our reserve build of $3.6 billion reflects the expected increase in life-of-loan losses, given the weaker current and expected economic conditions as a result of the virus.
However, there were a couple of leading indicators of deteriorating asset quality in our commercial portfolio due to the virus as both NPLs and reservable criticized exposures increased.
Investments supported continued growth of loans, as well as deposits, as a result, our cost of deposits declined to 150 basis points.
At the same time, revolvers draws didnÃ¢ÂÂt happen until late in the quarter and will likely be more fully reflected in Q2 averages of loans and NII.
We generated $1.4 billion in investment banking fees this quarter, a 10% increase year-over-year.
Growth in investment banking fees, loans and deposits reflected not only what we believe to be a flight to quality in uncertain times, but also the addition of hundreds of bankers over the past few years increasing and improving client coverage.
Despite the volatility experienced in the quarter, Global Markets produced $1.5 billion of earnings in Q1, a 34% increase year-over-year.
I know we have been through stress tests here for 10 years now and it would just be helpful to understand how you decided to size the very significant increase in the reserve and how you think it trajects from here?
I think when you think about reserves, you have got to really focus on loan mix and the quality of the portfolio and then you have the added variable under CECL of everybody coming up with a view of the future.
Those of you like yourself who have been around our company a lot, I went back and started saying sort of are we sure how much different we are and people forget things that wonÃ¢ÂÂt mean a lot to people on the phone, the gold option program, which was a restructuring of card debt that went on in the mid-2000s, it started to go into the crisis in 2008 time frame at $25 billion, eight quarters later, six quarters later, something like that, itÃ¢ÂÂs down to 12, half of that was charge-off.
And given what we know, we have earned twice the dividend this quarter at $0.40 versus $0.18 payout ratio and we expect that to continue and that shows you the 100-plus basis points, 130 basis points of excess capital.
On any given time, we are showing them severely adverse cases, adverse cases and thinking through the pretax PPNR capability of withstanding different reserve builds and outcomes and so thatÃ¢ÂÂs what we are doing and trying to keep it going.
Just a quick follow-up on that, Paul, I know you mentioned in terms of the macro assumptions itÃ¢ÂÂs a weighted average, but what you described is kind of a 2Q deep dive in GDP and then continuing negative for the rest of the year.
Is that kind of the central case, is there any more details you could provide on that as we compare different banks and what macro assumptions are embedded into the reserve, itÃ¢ÂÂs helpful to know the kind of the maybe central case of assumptions?
I mean, just to be clear, what I said was, itÃ¢ÂÂs a significant drop in GDP in the second quarter and then negative GDP growth to extend well into 2021, I think, approaching all the way to the end of the year.
But it is interesting and itÃ¢ÂÂs maybe helpful for all of you in terms of comparing reserves to really think about the loan mix, the quality of the portfolio and then, of course, what people assumed about the future.
So our reserve build reflects what we think as of the end of the quarter we are going to have to have in losses for the life of the assets on our books.
So all these factors will play in, itÃ¢ÂÂs just a little premature to call anything, Mike, and so thatÃ¢ÂÂs the factors we are looking at as we look at not only to your point about how you said potential losses based on our customer base and their behavior and what happens to them, but also based on our view of the economy opening up.
I mean, itÃ¢ÂÂs just -- thatÃ¢ÂÂs -- people are -- we all want to see where the end is, you included, Mike, we do too, but the question is we have got to wait for some time to pass to have a feel for that.
Is the -- what I consider the -- not as severe reserve on the commercial side assumption of not knowing the timing, the mix of business or is it where you sit in the capital, meaning even if some of those companies run into issues, your historical experience in the last bunch of years has been actually really, really good.
But that earnings power to absorb pay as you go losses on the consumer side in terms of card charge-offs and things like that or building reserves and then going through on the commercial side, which is what happens typically.
That earnings power is I think what we feel has us in good stead in terms of the ability to absorb whatever circumstances play out here and still -- with more liquidity than the start of the year, more capital than we need, 130 basis points more capital and the PP&R volume that lets us drive through it.
And if you think about that PP&R when you look at the stress test and stuff, we are running a lot higher than the stress test assumed, because they assume thereÃ¢ÂÂs market losses and things like that, which we didnÃ¢ÂÂt experience even in the most volatile periods of time in the markets history.
And so I think as you play this out that -- whether we can all talk about the reserve of X or Y or Z per thing, which is what you all are focused on and should be focused on, the reality is how much earnings capacity you have to keep generating capital and keep generating earnings that you can offset whatever comes at you and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what we feel good about.
The NII guidance, obviously, helpful and coming off a much better than expected 1Q, just wonder if you can give a little more detail in terms of I assume some of the sharp drop is higher bond premium amortization, lower trading, and then, obviously, kind of coordinate pressure, is how I think about the three buckets.
But I would think as you kind of look to the back half this year and beyond, some of those line draw downs in commercial start to get paid off, so that maybe itÃ¢ÂÂs tougher to grow the balance sheet or at least tougher to grow loans?
And then, of course, we have got securities and other assets maturing that we are going to replace at a lower yield and all thatÃ¢ÂÂs factored into our perspective that we think with loan and deposit growth, we can -- you will see NII kind of at that $11 billion level give or take roughly through the end of the year.
Can you just talk about across the businesses, what you are seeing from customers in terms of money coming out of the markets and whether itÃ¢ÂÂs sitting in money market mutual funds in Wealth Management or whether its moved on to the balance sheet and just kind of how that ties into your ability to re-price deposits?
My guess is two-thirds of that was more what you are speaking about a third or so was sort of the core growth building up that we saw coming into the tail end of last year into the quarter maybe or a little less than that.
Another one and small business, the deferrals that you have seen so far probably going to rise, what are you thinking in terms of as you have done your reserving, what percentage of those ultimately may not make it at this point?
Before I turn the call over to Brian, let me remind you, we may make forward-looking statements during this call.
I want to thank my 209,000 teammates across our company for all of their efforts this quarter both in the front-line roles and support functions.
Their role is -- we have seen major disruption in the financial markets that affected every line of business as customers move to stay-at-home status through voluntary or involuntary measures.
We also met our larger commercial borrowing customersÃ¢ÂÂ demands with commercial loans increasing $67 billion, as clients drew down against their unfunded commitments and new commitments were made.
NII finished a bit better than expected at $12.3 billion on an FTE basis, flat with fourth quarter.
We have been there for clients with both upgraded systems and capabilities to allow them to trade, investment office, supplementing 20,000 advisorsÃ¢ÂÂ capabilities to talk to their clients and give advice and counsel, client engagement during the quarter is up two-thirds from last year even though our advisors work from home.
In fact, March ended up being the busiest month ever for U.S. high-grade market with approximately $260 billion of total issuances.
We have also increased our community development financial institutions by $250 million on top of our industry-leading $1.5 billion commitment to these institutions.
We have seen consumer digital logins remain steady as people manage their financial lives on a digital basis.
We are seeing clientsÃ¢ÂÂ attentions turn from securing liquidity to more structured view of their capital position and their needs to better understand how they prosper and fare in the COVID-19 impacted business model.
Global Banking deposits rose $94 billion, which is unusual for sure.
ShareholdersÃ¢ÂÂ equity of $265 billion was stable with year-end but included some offsetting factors.
Note the significant increases across consumer and GWIM, which was driven by residential mortgage given continued low interest rates.
I would also note credit card balances, average credit card loans were down a bit more than the typical seasonality, given the drop-off in consumer spending late in the quarter, while customer payment rates continued at a fairly steady pace.
One less day of interest and lower asset yields driven by lower rates negatively impacted NII this quarter.
On the short-end with LIBOR which impacts variable rate loan pricing, as well as longer term rates which impact mortgage and mortgage related assets, have both dropped nearly 80 basis points on a spot basis.
Banking book sensitivity from an instantaneous parallel drop of 100 basis points in rate at that time was estimated to reduce NII by $6.5 billion over the following 12 months.
Since these rates moved less than 100 basis points, the change in NII over the next 12 months is likely to be less than $6.5 billion.
Total net charge-offs this quarter were $1.1 billion or 46 basis points of average loans.
Consumer Banking earned $1.8 billion.
Results were impacted by COVID-19 through lower rates, higher provision expense and modest fee reductions.
Many of these additional personnel are working from home, while net income declined 45% from Q1 2019, itÃ¢ÂÂs worth noting pretax pre-provision income declined 12%.
Client momentum continued as we saw average deposits increase $40 billion from Q1 Ã¢ÂÂ19, average loans increased 8% and we continued to add consumer investment accounts and saw solid flows into our Merrill Edge platform.
Turning to Wealth -- turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 19, here again, we saw lower rates and COVID-19 related credit costs impact an otherwise solid quarter.
On a pretax pre-provision income basis, results declined 21% driven by lower interest rates and by roughly $450 million of net markdowns in the value of loans and underwritten commitments recorded at fair value in our capital markets books and FBO books.
The loss reflects approximately $500 million for several valuation reductions including marks on derivative positions and certain noncore securities, which were impacted by wider spreads toward the end of the quarter.
So when we weighted the scenarios that produced a -- clearly a recessionary outlook, which included a significant drop in GDP in the second quarter with negative GDP growth rates extending well into 2021.
I think itÃ¢ÂÂs helpful for us to compare across banks that way.
I donÃ¢ÂÂt know if thatÃ¢ÂÂs right or you want to parse it differently, but any additional color would be helpful?
So we -- thatÃ¢ÂÂs why we donÃ¢ÂÂt give guidance on it because it can change pretty rapidly depending on what they are buying and selling for clients in Global Markets.
I donÃ¢ÂÂt know if thatÃ¢ÂÂs the right way to think about it?
I mean, thereÃ¢ÂÂs no question that commercial revolver lines which spiked in March, will start to pay down once economic conditions start to improve.
Obviously, deposit balances also benefit NII because you donÃ¢ÂÂt necessarily have to make a loan.
As the markets stabilize and economic activity returns, we do expect some component of those deposit balances to flow out over time as clients pay down their lines to pay other bills and redeploy liquidity.
Our capital ratio is 130 basis points over our minimums.

CITI,q2,2015,"Hello, and welcome to Citi's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
In consumer banking, high quality checking deposit growth improve spreads and higher mortgage originations drove revenue growth in the U.S. while weÂve optimized our branch footprint to focus on seven cities.
Citi core expenses were down 1% as ongoing efficiency savings and lower legal and repositioning cost will largely offset by higher regulatory and compliance cost.
Slide 9 shows the results for North America consumer banking.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 11% from last year, reflecting continued loan and checking deposit growth, higher mortgage origination activity and improved deposit spreads.
And retail services revenues were flat to last year with improved spreads being offset by the continued impact of lower fuel prices and higher contractual partner payments.
Over the last 12 months, our consumer efficiency ratio was 54% including overall 150 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges.
Investment Banking revenues of 1.3 billon were down 4% from last year as higher M&A revenues were more than offset by lower underwriting activity as compared to a very strong second quarter last year consistent with overall market trends.
Year-to-date, investment banking revenues were up 4% driven by strong M&A results and we have gained overall wallet versus 2014 particularly in North America.
In constant dollars, lending revenues grew 4% from last year as higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads.
In spread products however, activity levels declined versus last year in credit products in particular resulting in lower revenues.
Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings asset which totaled a $116 billion at quarter end, down 22% from a year ago.
The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing a consistent growth trend year-over-year even as the contribution from Citi Holdings has continued to strength.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
And then maybe one just accounting question on the DTA you used 1.2 billion last quarter, it seems like that dropped the values using up 300 million this quarter, yet looks like North America net income was pretty similar to last quarter, why the balance, why not using more DTAs this quarter?
Your next question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Alright, thanks a lot John.
You know Brennan I donÂt have that particular figure either with me or in my head, so I canÂt answer that question for you right now.
Thanks a lot for all the color John.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
I know just you didnÂt change the overall company expense ratio, so just wanted to see if what you are saying is youÂve got other cost saves even further ahead of plan happening elsewhere in the organization thatÂs funding, this investments spend in consumer or you are saying we see good payback relatively good timeframe and as a result weÂre just going to let this rise up a little bit as reinvesting, weÂll get it back next year?
My question is on how your best in class capital ratios particularly on the leverage is impacting your client conversations in markets.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Good afternoon, gentlemen, thanks for taking my calls - my questions.
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton.
Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
Your next question will come from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities.
With half the year behind us, weÂve remained on track to hit our financial targets in terms of return on assets in our efficiency ratio.
In ICG, weÂve grown our investment banking wallet share year-to-date and our Private Bank continued to show strong rise in revenue growth.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $632 billion as 4% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wine down of Citi Holdings.
Deposits also decreased 1% driven by Citi Holdings including the reclassification of $21 billion of Japan retail deposits to held for sale in the fourth quarter of last year.
Citicorp revenues were up 5% year-over-year mostly driven by growth in our institutional franchise and revenues declined in Citi Holdings reflecting continued asset reductions as well as the impact of classifying our OneMain business as held for sale at the end of last quarter.
And as I just described, we generated positive operating leverage again this quarter in Citicorp with 5% growth in revenues and 1% decline in expenses in constant dollars.
Net income grew 25% year-over-year driven higher revenues, lower operating expenses and an improvement in credit cost, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.
Revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the second quarter, reflecting volume growth, partially offset by spread compression and ongoing regulatory headwinds in certain markets.
In Latin America, we grew revenues 3% driven by modest loan and deposit growth in Mexico, partially offset by the impact of selling our consumer franchise in Honduras last year.
Asia card loans and purchase sales both grew year-over-year by 4% and 5% respectfully but this growth was offset by lower spreads driven by continued higher payment rates and the impact of regulatory changes in certain markets.
Operating expenses declined 5% as lower repositioning cost were partially offset by the impact of volume growth, higher regulatory and compliance cost and technology investments and credit cost declined from last year.
Branded cards revenues of $1.9 billion were down 5% from last year as 5% growth in purchase sales and improved spreads were more than offset by the impact of lower average loans mostly driven by the continued runoff of promotional rate balances and higher payment rates.
We now expect the total consumer efficiency ratio for 2015 to be somewhere in the range of 52% to 53% consistent with our plans to begin gradually increasing the level of investment spend during the second half of the year, primarily in the U.S. branded cards.
Private Bank revenues of 746 million grew 13% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in investments and capital markets products as well as higher loan and deposit balances.
Rates and currencies revenues grew by double digits year-over-year in the second quarter as investor client activity and market volatility were improved versus last year, G10 rates was the key driver of growth.
Excluding the adjustments, equities revenues would have increased by 26% from last year, driven by growth and derivatives, improved trading performance EMEA and strong client momentum in Asia.
Total operative expenses of 4.8 billion grew 2% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance cost were partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation and credit was a positive in the quarter.
We continued to expect to achieve a total ICG efficiency ratio closer to the mid-point of the 53% to 57% target range for the full year 2015.
Revenues were higher year-over-year and sequential, driven mainly by gains on debt buybacks as well as real estate sales in the recent quarter, partially offset by hedging activities and expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs.
Revenues of 1.7 billion declined by over 300 million from last year, driven by the reduction in assets as well as the impact of classifying our OneMain business as held for sale at the end of the quarter.
As I described earlier, as a result of the HFS accounting treatment, approximately $160 million of net credit losses were recorded as a reduction in revenue during the second quarter.
In summary, we continued to make progress in the second quarter with revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Citicorp, lower legal and repositioning expenses and continued favorable credit trends.
But for the full year, we continued to expect to deliver a Citicorp efficiency ratio in the mid 50% range and a Citigroup ROA of over 90 basis points.
Turning to the second half of this year, we continued to expect modest revenue growth in Citicorp.
In consumer, in North America, we expect continued underlying revenue growth in our retail banking franchise, although comparisons for the prior year will be impacted by certain onetime items that benefited our mortgage business last year as previous disclosed.
And the North America cards, revenue will likely remain under pressure in the second half of the year as it will take some time for our incremental investment spend to drive top line results.
In international consumer, we continue to believe we can generate revenue growth and positive operating leverage year-over-year in the second half of 2015, driven by continued modest growth in Mexico as well as continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds in Asia as we begin to lap some of the spread compression and regulatory changes we absorbed last year.
Turning to the institutional franchise, we continued to see good momentum across Corporate Lending, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services and the Private Bank which together generated 8% year-over-year revenue growth in the first half of the year in constant dollars.
Investment banking revenues will depend in part on the overall market, but we continue to feel good about the strength of our franchise generating 4% year-over-year revenue growth in the first half with overall wallet share gains versus 2014.
We expect credit cost to increase somewhat in the second half of the year driven by loan growth as well as lower loan loss reserve releases and we expect to keep balance sheet discipline staying at or below our current size.
May be we could take a little bit just about the expense trajectory from here, you highlighted higher regulatory expenses in some investments in U.S. cards, but maybe you can kind of give us, but youÂve also havenÂt seen much of a decline in markets expenses in the corporate bank yet, seasonally we should expect some decline revenues.
So we think that we are towards the end of that growth cycle, but thatÂs something really for 2016 story, I donÂt see that for the second half of this year.
You know we said mid-50s for this year, could we do something more sure, but you take a look at the progress that weÂve made already, weÂre operating Citicorp at 55%, weÂre operating Citigroup overall with an efficiency ratio of 56%.
Yeah, I mean you know Glenn, what weÂre working to would be to do the best job we can of matching up the cost of the debt buybacks with the gain recognition on OneMain, thatÂs a very much our focus and thatÂs what we are going to try to do.
And I think itÂs a little bit early right now to make comments on the overall tone whatÂs rating will be for the balance of the third quarter, but we managed to work our way through a series of events.
However given where we are in this year and given the fact that we do want to begin to put some additional marketing spend against U.S. branded cards in the third and fourth quarter which we think is the right thing to do from a top line - future top line growth point of view.
Last question from me, thinking about Holdings and the North American mortgage book, as of last quarter, about 24 or so billion of the 54 billion mortgage was second lean which is might saying that itÂs basically not market above, so I am just kind of curious of the remaining roughly 50 billion of mortgage that is first lean.
Obviously we are not doing, OneMain is something that weÂve focused on for some period of time, so that is all part of the holding story and trying to continue to wind down holding, so we would look at that as something is exiting a what is really a good business but if one that just doesnÂt fit with our strategy and Costco we continue to believe that that is something that will be accretive to next year.
You know Mike, let me just jump in for a second because I think itÂs going to be hard for us to give a long term guidance as far as return on assets until we get more clarity around some of the regulatory rules that still need to be set including especially the TLAC.
We need to get the cardÂs franchise back contributing and thatÂs really more matter of just being able to lap those regulatory changes and make sure then that weÂve seen the abatement in the spread pressure that weÂve otherwise been facing, which is why we are more confident on the revenue growth of that franchise going into the second half of the year.
When we take a look at trying to manage Citi, overall Citi to an efficiency ratio, itÂs very much as you say weÂve got several things to look at, the performance of the ICG which from an expense point of view, even at efficiency ratio point of view this year has been quite good.
You know weÂre continuing to do debt issuance if thatÂs request and obviously weÂve matter of fact when we take a look at the amount of preferred and the amount of debt that we issued last question, IÂd say was quite substantial.
So thatÂs why I wanted to make sure you were aware of the fact that itÂs likely to end they have for the full year an efficiency ratio slightly above where I would have said at the last time.
",46.64,0.7767386
CITI,q3,2015,"And despite the revenue headwinds we once again proved our ability to manage our expenses and will remain on track to deliver our full year efficiency and return on asset targets.
We continued to improve the quality of our balance sheet by replacing legacy assets from Citi Holdings with high solid loans in Citicorp.
With one quarter to go we are on track to hit our financial targets in return of assets and our efficiency ratio and we also earned a 10% return on tangible common equity so far this year.
And in branded cards we are seeing growth in active accounts and purchase sales although itÂs going to take some time for the full benefit of our investments in this business to be reflected in our results.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined to 1% year-over-year to 622 billion as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued line down of Citi Holdings.
Citicorp revenues were up slightly year-over-year and Citi Holdings revenues declined by nearly 30% mostly reflecting higher gains on asset sales in the prior year including the impact of selling our consumer operations in Spain and Greece.
As I just described we generated positive operating leverage again this quarter in Citicorp with revenues up slightly and expenses down 13% in constant dollars.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 6% year-over-year driven by lower investment sales revenues as well as continued high payment rates and ongoing regulatory pressure in cards.
We saw an industry wide slow down in activity in Asia during the quarter reflecting changes in consumer sentiment driven by slowing economic growth and the recent volatility in the capital markets.
Card loans still grew modestly year-over-year but this growth was muted by the impact of continued high payment rates.
At less than $3 billion, the Brazil consumer portfolio now represents just 1% of our global consumer loans and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our total consumer cost of credit as we look forward.
In branded cards revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and rewards cost as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products.
Of course this has the revenue growth in cards will take some time and the full benefits of our actions may not be completely reflected in our results for perhaps another two years as we build new loans to offset the continued run off in our legacy products.
Finally, turning to retail services, revenues declined 2% from last year reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices as well as higher contractual partner payments, as we continued to share some of the benefits of higher yields and lower net credit losses with our retail partners.
Turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 12, revenues of 8.4 billion in the third quarter declined 3% from last year.
This represents the seventh consecutive quarter that weÂve generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis.
In constant dollars lending revenues declined 4% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads and the impact of loan sale activity.
Our G10 rates business as roughly flat year-over-year for the quarter but we did see significantly lower than expected revenues in the back half of September.
Turning to equities, excluding the impact of reversing $140 million of the valuation adjustment we recognized in the second quarter, revenues increased by 12% from last year driven by growth in derivatives with particular strength in North America and Asia.
And in security services revenues declined 4% on a reported basis and were up 7% in constant dollars, reflecting increased activity and higher client balances.
We have continued to make great progress in opening down Citi Holdings with signed agreements to selling additional $37 billion of assets, $31 billion of which we currently expect to close in the fourth quarter.
Our net interest margin was 294 basis points in the third quarter, roughly in line with the prior quarter as trading NIM continued to be higher than expected.
Looking to the fourth quarter, our net interest margin will depend on a number of factors including the level of trading them, the timing of expected divestitures in Citi Holdings, and a magnitude in timing of any debt redemption actions.
Three quarters into the year we have an efficiency ratio in Citicorp of 55.4%, a Citigroup ROA of 99 basis points, and we earn the return on tangible common equity of 10%.
We are certainly seeing the impact of slower global growth and macro uncertainty on our top line results, but we feel good about our ability to manage risk through this cycle.
Looking to the fourth quarter, in North America consumer revenues will likely be roughly flat to the third quarter and in international consumer we expect revenue to be slight to slightly higher than last year on a constant dollar basis as we expect continued modest volume growth with Asia revenues beginning to stabilize.
Turning to the institutional franchise, we continue to see good momentum across treasury and trade solutions, security services, and the private bank which together generated 8% year-over-year revenue growth in the first nine months of the year in constant dollars.
Finally for total Citigroup we expect our cost of credit to be roughly flat to the third quarter excluding any impact from the portfolio of sales out of Citi Holdings.
Just the asset sales, 31 billion this quarter, potentially 37 billion in total, can you help us think about the impact on capital ratios when they are done?
Alright Glenn, so again as we have said in the past, and I will give you a bit of a run down, our energy related loans, the total exposure remains about constant to where we were last year at about $60 billion worth of total energy related exposure.
So as you think about the exit level of this year of the net interest margin, essentially a good kind of 1Q 2016 level, just holding rates, holding mix, and holding all that steady how would that NIM compare to the current third quarter NIM or what you are expecting in 4Q?
So in the -- just following up on the Holdings questions in the sale of assets that you expect to close here in the fourth quarter, is there an updated sense about how much of the expense base of Holdings should come out on the back of this?
But if the environment remains difficult, do you have the ability to pull levers and work the efficiency ratio down further from here or are we going to be in a waiting game until the revenues can come through, just how should we think about that?
And the efficiency ratio target that we have put out for Citicorp and we have put this out more than two and half years ago now, when we were looking at what we thought would be a difficult environment in 2015 and the environment has actually proved to be even more difficult I think than we thought at that point in time when we said we can operate overall Citicorp with an efficiency ratio of in the mid 50s.
And it takes a lot of management in this type of environment to continue to operate at that efficiency ratio and still have room to make the investments that you want us to make so that when the environment improves we can generate even higher levels of revenue growth.
Okay, I guess last one from me then if we think about your new card offering how is it that you would recommend we measure success based upon the change, the new products that youÂve put out the Â the offering what metrics would you guys us to look to if some of the components of the environment for revenue remain challenging?
You know core expenses are up slightly and again itÂs in line with the plans that we had going into this year when we thought about what we needed to do in order to generate the efficiency ratios that we were targeting.
So I think it is really, you really need to look at the $108 billion then of credit and market risk assets that are supporting to the holdings as really being the opportunity that we have now for further capital reduction and as we wind down the balance of the holdings.
And then just a follow up question on the international consumer banking side and to your point about flat year-over-year constant dollar, and your comments about the investments sales slowing, any sense if that investments have slow down, was kind of just customers freezing given what was happening this quarter and what are you seeing just in terms of the international consumer activity aside from revenue just in terms of the behavior and activity as you look ahead?
I just wanted to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about it in 2016 where maybe you donÂt have the offset of the holdings run off and you still have continued core growth in Citicorp, should we expect those RWAs to begin to trend on an upward trajectory?
I do believe on the last quarter's call you had said the midpoint of the 53% to 57% target range which is just maybe some upward pressure on the efficiency ratio and I just wanted to guess as to whether that is a reflection of revenue pressures.
I know that revenues on a constant dollar basis were down about 1% year-on-year through the first nine months or more a function of what you are seeing in terms of the performance thus far, maybe your outlook ahead of the fourth quarter?
So, you can assume that this is, I am thinking that we are going to be slightly above where I would have targeted at the end of the last quarter and it very much reflects the revenue pressure that --
Okay and then just lastly on the U.S. credit card environment you mentioned that the two years forward is when with the new accounts you get to a better lending environment obviously because at first you get the new accounts in and they spend and then they borrow, I just wanted to understand was that two years to what you think is average run rate in borrowing or in revolving for the accounts that you are looking for, or is that, when you start to see the beginnings of borrowings.
You know I donÂt want to get into a specific guidance point on loan growth in Citicorp on constant dollars but we do think that again, this quarter it did present certain challenges.
Hello, and welcome to Citi's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Thank you Susan and good morning everyone.
Hey, thank you Mike and good morning everyone.
And deposits were flat versus last year at 904 billion also reflecting 4% growth in Citicorp offset by a decline in Citi Holdings.
In Latin America, excluding the gain of approximately $180 million this quarter on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in Mexico, revenues were roughly flat versus last year as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression.
Card loan balances in Mexico remained under pressure this quarter reflecting both slower economic growth and ongoing shifts in consumer behavior.
Operating expenses grew 1% as higher regulatory and compliance cost and technology investments were mostly offset by lower legal and repositioning cost as well as ongoing efficiency savings.
And credit cost increased 7% from last year driven by our loan loss reserve build in Latin America.
Retail banking revenues of 1.3 billion grew 3% from last year as continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads were partially offset by the impact of $15 million mortgage repurchase reserve release in the prior year.
We expect the investments we are making today to generate higher net interest revenue overtime as growth in active accounts, better customer engagement, and higher purchase sales translated to higher full rate balances.
Total expenses of 2.3 billion in North America declined 6% as incremental investments were more than offset by lower repositioning cost and ongoing efficiency savings, as we have continued to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint.
Total banking revenues of 4 billion excluding the impact of gains on loan hedges were down 7% versus the prior year, mostly reflecting lower investment banking activity.
Debt underwriting revenues were down 17% driven by high yield and leverage loans, products where our core clients were less active this quarter than in the prior year.
Private bank revenues of 715 million grew 8% year-over-year driven by strong growth in managed investments revenue as well as higher loan and deposit balances.
Fixed income revenues of 2.6 billion were down 16% as we saw lower activity levels and a less favorable environment in the recent quarter particularly in securitized products in G10 FX.
The revenue impact was most significant in North America and Western Europe and was partially offset by strong performance again this quarter in our emerging markets franchise where our fixed income revenues grew 4% year-over-year.
Total credit costs were 309 million up sequentially reflecting a net loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release last quarter.
Revenues were higher year-over-year driven primarily by gains on debt buybacks and expenses were down mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs.
Slide 15 shows holdings assets which totaled $110 billion at quarter end, down 20% from a year ago.
Revenues of 1.4 billion declined 32% from last year mostly reflecting lower gains on asset sales as well as divestiture activity.
Expenses also declined driven mainly by the lower assets and cost of credit remains favorable driven by the North American mortgage portfolio where the total NCL rate improved to 1.2%.
The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars showing a consistent growth trend year-over-year even as the contribution from Citi Holdings has continued to shrink.
I know this is not a easy question to answer but if you look at your capital return, payout ratio is still below peers with the improvement in ratios sort of now better than most with asset sales, do you think you can get closer to peer payout ratios next year in CCAR or is there anything else we should be thinking about?
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Okay and then this question is for Mike following up on your comments about using excess capital and trying to avoid the denominator problem.
Great and shifting gears you mentioned in your prepared remarks about card loans, they grew modestly year-over-year but the growth was muted by the impact of continued high payment rates than regulatory changes.
Tangible [ph] rate, thanks John for taking my questions.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
I got it, okay, thanks that was very helpful.
Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions.
Okay, John thanks, thatÂs helpful.
Okay, thatÂs helpful, thanks.
Good, thanks for taking my questions.

CITI,q4,2015,"Overall, our institutional businesses saw improved performance from the fourth quarter of last year.
In Consumer, our North American performance continued to be impacted by investments we're making in our branded cards business, but we saw continued underlying growth and efficiency gains in retail banking.
We had a substantial decrease in Citi Holdings assets during the quarter largely driven by the closing of the sale of OneMain and consumer franchises in several countries.
Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 4% from last year, mostly driven by gains on asset sales in Citi Holdings, as well as growth in our institutional franchise, partially offset by the impact of FX translation.
And net credit losses continued to improve, offset by a significant loan loss reserve build this quarter largely in Citicorp compared to a net release in the prior year.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $618 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 4% to $908 billion.
And cost of credit grew 29% from the fourth quarter of last year driven by the net reserve build.
The net result of these actions was a pre-tax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion this quarter, better than we previously expected, driven by higher net gains on asset sales, as well as improved credit.
While Citi Holdings did outperform our expectations in the fourth quarter, the greatest driver of earnings growth for the full year was our Citicorp franchise.
Citicorp earned $16 billion in 2015, an increase of over $4.8 billion from the prior year, driven by growth in our operating margin, as well as a continued decline in net credit losses, partially offset by the impact of changes in loan loss reserves.
In Latin America, revenues were flat to last year, as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression in cards.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year driven by continued pressure on investment sales revenues, as well as continued high payment rates and ongoing regulatory pressures in cards.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 6% from last year including the impact of $130 million gain on the sale of a mortgage portfolio in the prior period.
In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year, driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and reward costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products.
We continue to feel good about the investments we are making with 8% year-over-year growth in active accounts and 13% growth in purchase sales in our core products.
We achieved modest year-over-year loan growth this quarter in our core portfolios, which account for roughly 80% of our total US branded card loans.
And with continued momentum, we believe we should return to growth in both total loans and revenues in the latter part of 2016 before the benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio.
The total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer banking in 2015 was nearly 54%, above our previous outlook of roughly 53%, driven mostly by lower than expected revenues in our international business, particularly in Asia.
Revenues of $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter grew 4% from last year with broad based growth across the franchise.
Fixed income revenues of $2.2 billion were up 7% from last year with growth in both macro and spread products, but were down 14% from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonally lower activity as well as the impact of continued macro uncertainty.
Turning to equities, revenues grew 29% from a difficult fourth quarter a year ago, driven by growth across products and improved performance in EMEA.
We incurred roughly $75 million of net credit losses on a limited number of credits in the energy portfolio this quarter, about two thirds of which was offset by related reserve releases.
The total efficiency ratio for ICG in 2015 was 56.7%, a little higher than our previous outlook of roughly 56%, mostly driven by lower than anticipated revenues in the fourth quarter, as well as higher repositioning costs.
As of today, we have signed agreements to reduce Citi Holdings GAAP assets by an additional $7 billion in 2016 and we'll continue to pursue other sales as well.
On slide 15, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter, which reflect the net gains on asset sales, as well as the impact of our debt buyback activities, legal and repositioning charges, and other episodic items.
As I described earlier, the net result of these actions was a pre-tax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, greater than we had anticipated, driven by higher net gains on asset sales, as well as improved credit.
As a result, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable in 2016, and the assets should continue to come down as well with a corresponding benefit to RWA.
We should recover about 3 basis points of this impact when we acquire the Costco portfolio which we currently expect to occur closer to the end of the second quarter.
During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12%, driven by net income and a reduction in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by movements in OCI, as well as $1.8 billion of common share buybacks and dividends.
Our DTA balance grew in the fourth quarter by approximately $600 million, driven by movements in OCI, partially offset by operating earnings.
The most significant of these planned investments for 2016 are in US cards, including the continued effort to grow active accounts in A&R and branded cards, which as I said earlier, should allow us to return to growth in both loans and revenues by the latter part of 2016.
Together, we believe these investments are important for growing our cards business and for improving our overall Citicorp efficiency and returns over time.
I think if you look at the last two quarters and then your guidance for the next two, it seems like you're adding, depending on what we assume for charge-offs $1.34 billion of reserves in the corporate book.
And the guidance that I gave you as far as the roughly $600 million worth of cost of credit in the first half of the year, that's really based on a scenario where oil prices remain at the - at least current levels when I walked into this meeting, of around $30 a barrel and staying there for a sustained period.
However, the continued efforts that I just referenced to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet resulted in us actually appearing in the 3.5% bucket by last year end.
We actually feel very good about the way the credit portfolio has performed in Russia over that period of time.
And again, I think that's by and large a theme that you'll hear as I talk about every country and whether I'm talking about consumer or the ICG, is that overall, our very tightly focused customer strategy in each of our businesses gives us a credit portfolio that is quite resilient when it comes to times of trouble.
Those NCLs were offset by reserve releases and again, we feel pretty good about the way the overall portfolio is operating in Brazil.
And again, when you take a look at what's going on in the commercial portfolio certainly outside of Brazil, we've got some deterioration in SMEs. Lower oil prices in particular are a benefit to customers on a broader scale probably than any impact on the SMEs. So we just don't see that there.
And as I had mentioned in response to Glenn's question, even if that were to happen, we still expect our consumer portfolios to be more resilient than the broader market given our focus on higher quality segments, and which we think is really the right strategy for us.
So when you take a look at our EM consumer exposures around the world, we continue to feel good about the underlying credit quality overall.
But could you maybe set for us how we should think about now at this point from where we are, and I know it's a fluid situation because as you announced, you've still got several billion dollars of sales already inked here for 2016.
But what's the right way to think about the revenue and expense rate jumping off point from here in holdings?
The best guidance I can give you, Brennan, is the guidance that I tried to give you during the call, which is think in terms of holdings being marginally profitable on an EBT point of view in each quarter next year.
Yes, our look at holdings, if you take a look at DTA for the full year this year, consistent with what we've said, we got about $2.5 billion of DTA reduction out of our - out of our businesses.
And so that will, you know, especially when you think about the impact on our available for sale securities, those are losses that we need to take today that will largely accrete back to us over time.
A lot of the things where you've seen this year where we've had good growth but think there's more.
That obviously could evolve over time, but I'd say based on what we know today, we think for a company with the construct of our balance sheet, risk profile, et cetera, that's probably the right range for now.
And then just finally, I know John, you talked about the pretax contribution that your actions in Citi Holdings had in the quarter, about a $1.3 billion.
So we've had about, we certainly have had the first 25 basis point increase and that's good and we're counting on that and that's performing pretty much the way that we would have expected as far as the impact on our businesses.
And then one question on balance sheet size, still things coming out of averages after the sales this quarter, the pending sales going forward.
It looks like on a year-over-year basis you were able to generate some operating leverage with revenues down a little bit less than costs.
John, you'd mentioned in the past when holdings was a much bigger portion of the overall balance sheet that maybe at around 5% of assets you would think about folding holdings back into at least the reporting of the company.
You've seen us, we talked about the overall headcount reduction which is net of significant investment into controls and we're going to continue to be mindful and to make sure that we are scaling and sizing our company to what we think the opportunities are.
And don't forget, I mean, with the investments that we're planning, our guidance is that we intend to hold the operating efficiency ratio constant with this year.
But within the submission itself, Mike, you mentioned that you like how the fourth quarter balance sheet looks, but does Costco and the additional receivables have to be contemplated as part of your submission?
I appreciate a lot of the guidance that you've given in terms of the holdings trajectory and the reduction that we're expecting on the coming year.
But then you've got on the other hand, we continually, as I said before, looking to make sure that we're running even a more risk efficient balance sheet.
Hello and welcome to Citi's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
And internationally, market sentiment clearly affected our investment sales contributing to lower overall revenues from a year ago.
We also made significant progress on DTA utilization, generating significant regulatory capital and ending the year with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% on a fully implemented basis.
Now going into the year, our goals were to generate top line growth to deliver modest positive operating leverage on our core expense base and to significantly reduce the earnings drag from legal and repositioning costs.
Card purchase sales continued to grow up 10%, but card loans were flat year-over-year in Latin America driven by higher payment rates in our Mexico cards portfolio.
Operating expenses grew 3% as higher regulatory and compliance costs, technology investments and certain one-time items were partially offset by lower legal and repositioning costs, as well as ongoing efficiency savings.
In credit cards and other retail loans, our NCL and delinquency rates remained broadly stable versus last quarter across the emerging markets.
Excluding this gain, retail banking revenues grew 4% reflecting continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads.
Finally, turning to retail services, revenues declined 1% from last year mostly reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices on both loan growth and purchase sales.
Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America declined 6% driven by lower repositioning costs and ongoing efficiency savings, as we continued to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint.
Credit was broadly stable in North America and Asia again this quarter with loss rates of 226 and 84 basis points respectively.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars driven by growth in high quality deposits and spreads.
Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion increased 6% from last year, while our equity underwriting revenues rebounded somewhat from the third quarter, they were down 18% from last year on lower overall industry activity.
In constant dollars, lending revenues declined 2% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads.
Total Markets and Security Services revenues of $3.2 billion grew 9% from last year.
And in Security Services revenues grew 2% on a reported basis and were up 12% in constant dollars reflecting increased activity and higher client balances.
Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion declined 1% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance costs as well as compensation expense were more than offset by lower repositioning costs, incremental efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation.
Total credit costs were $641 million, up from $309 million last quarter, mostly reflecting the impact of loan loss reserve builds.
Excluding the impact of these specific reserve releases, we built roughly $300 million of energy related loan loss reserves this quarter, reflecting our view that oil prices are likely to remain low for a longer period of time.
Our local markets rates and currencies business was remarkably stable and profitable franchise again in 2015 generating revenues in the range of $1 billion per quarter.
We currently expect the benefits of lower funding costs, the exit of loss making portfolios and other repositioning efforts to offset virtually all of the operating earnings previously contributed by OneMain.
The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while City Holdings has continued to shrink.

Asia accounts for 70% of our total International Consumer portfolio and we've seen loss rates under 100 basis points in Asia for the past 4 years.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Can you talk about the outlook for DTA consumption and maybe some of the levers to pull if there's continued headwinds either related to OCI or just macro environment impacts to the actual earnings?
And then just separately, you mentioned about investing in high ROA businesses and obviously spent some time going through the US credit card effort.

CITI,q1,2016,"We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses, utilized different tax assets, generated and returned capital to our shareholders and reduced our expenses while absorbing a significant repositioning charge.
Revenues of $17.6 billion declined 11% from last year, mostly driven by lower industry-wide activity in markets and investment banking, a continued wind down of Citi Holdings and the impact of FX translation.
Expenses decreased 3% year-over-year, driven by the wind down of Citi Holdings, lower legal expenses and the benefit from FX translation, partially offset by higher repositioning costs and ongoing investments in the franchise.
And net credit losses continued to improve offset by a loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release in the prior year.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 1% year-over-year to $619 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 5% to $935 billion.
In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were down 6% from last year, mostly driven by capital markets related businesses, fixed income, equities, investment banking and Asia Wealth Management as well as the impact of our continued investments in U.S. branded cards.
And Latin America consumer, which is now comprised solely of our Mexico franchise, revenues grew 2% as growth in retail banking continued to be partially offset by pressure in cards.
However, card balances remained under pressure in Mexico, as continued growth in purchase sales was offset by higher payment rates, reflecting our focus on higher credit quality segments of the market.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues decline 4% year-over-year, driven by weak investment sales revenues, as well as continued but abating regulatory pressures in cards.
And finally, total international consumer credit costs increased 7% from last year, reflecting the impact of reserve releases in the prior period.
In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 6% from last year, driven by higher acquisition and rewards costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products.
And finally, credit costs in North America increased 17% from last year, driven by a reserve build of approximately $80 million this quarter in our commercial portfolio related to energy credits.
Card revenues were still down year-over-year this quarter but we believe we can return to growth sometime in the latter part of 2016, not including the benefit of acquiring the cost Costco portfolio.
First is the impact of the current environment on market sensitive businesses including wealth management as well as mortgage, which together drove a year-over-year decline in revenues of nearly $150 million.
And weÂve achieved this growth with very little change in our core expenses, in fact year-over-year the entire increase in our consumer operating expenses was driven by the combination of investments and higher repositioning costs.
As we move forward, we believe, we are making the right investments to grow the higher return markets and products in our franchise and that as these investments mature and we cycle past the remaining regulatory headwinds, we will be well positioned to drive higher returns to something in the range of 20% RoTCE in a more normal rate environment.
Turning now to the intuitional clients group on Slide 12, revenues of $8 billion in the first quarter declined 12% from last year, driven by market sensitive businesses, fixed income, equities, and investment banking, total banking revenues of $4 billion excluding the impact of loan hedges declined 6%.
First, despite the challenging market conditions this quarter, we continued to see growth in several of our accrual and transaction services businesses including treasury and trades solutions, private banks, and security services.
To offset these pressures, we continue to actively address our structure, reducing capacity in areas where revenues are likely to remain muted, while preserving our client facing capabilities, and these actions drove much of the repositioning charge in ICG this quarter.
It does not mean that we would be immune to revenue swings in more market sensitive businesses like markets and investment banking, but our mix of traditional banking and transaction services does provide a stable, growing base of revenues in more efficient, higher return businesses where we believe revenues are likely to remain muted and weÂre taking appropriate measures to optimize our capacity without diminishing our client capabilities, and we are remaining disciplined on credit.
Our NIM should be fairly stable at this level in the second quarter as we continue to offset the impact of the wind down of Citi Holdings, with improvements in the core franchise.
Clearly, this year started with a more challenging environment than we had anticipated, resulting in lower revenues and a higher operating efficiency ratio than we had planned, even before the pull forward of certain repositioning actions into the quarter.
While the expense saves resulting from these repositioning actions will help offset some of this pressure, we still expect our full year operating efficiency ratio to be higher than we had anticipated, in the range of around 58%.
We believe investment banking revenues should recover from first quarter levels, if the environment is favorable, based on the significant backlog of deals we have pending with our clients.
On the consumer side, we continue to believe we can achieve year over year revenue growth in our existing U.S. branded cards and Asia cards businesses in the latter half of 2016.
And also, donÂt forget, we do believe that in the second half of the year, we are going to get year-over-year revenue growth coming out of the U.S. branded cards business as well as the Asia cards business, one as we see those investments begin to really kick-in on the final piece of the puzzle.
And in Asia, again, credit cards, we believe that weÂre working our way through the last of the regulatory pressure and therefore we should get growth out of that business.
But yes, IÂd say itÂs those things and then the continued growth of the accrual businesses and ICG, and the big wild card is going to be what happens with market sentiment.
So, those are elements of the path forward and then the final is as we have put out we still believe that our consumer business is capable of generating a 20% RoTCE in a normal environment and the ICG of 14% in consumer we told you and we're focused, we're focused on cards and wealth management, we think that that's the right path forward, we think that's the right way to grow revenue, we think that those are both good efficiency and a high return businesses, we've got to focus on moving more of our account acquisition to digital channels that'll really benefit the efficiency ratio as well.
7% compound annual growth rate even in the somewhat challenging environment that we've all been operating in the last two years, investment banking we feel really good about that franchise, it's a bad quarter, there wasn't much deal volume.
Yes looking at the global consumer bank, in the last couple of years you've given us guidance on positive operating leverage and maybe not on a quarterly basis but on an annual basis we saw that you delivered that in both 2014 and '15, and this year, I guess the first quarter doesn't look good and then you've got all these moving parts with Costco coming in and other jurisdictions being shutdown.
Especially with the large amount of repositioning then that we did in the first quarter, so I think it is going to hard to generate that type of story for 2016, but we do think then that again, the business that we're growing and the business that we're investing in is one that is going to be capable of generating on a consistent basis positive operating leverage and higher returns, so that's what we're trying to do Chris.
With the 180 write down that we took our remaining investment in that country is $4 million so it looks like itÂs headed for some really good ROE, if and when the business can come back.
And Costco first year we have it Costco will not be contributing much just because of the way the accounting works, but we think thatÂs a really good business and looking forward the contributions that will make in the second half of Â17 and then into Â18.
Just one question on the profitability targets, I know we spent quite a bit of time on it this morning but taking the challenging revenue by what we saw in 1Q the 100 basis point increase in the efficiency target and then the breakeven guidance for Holdings for the remainder of the year.
Well any number that I gave you is ex-Costco, and I didn't give you a view towards what consumer would be, but donÂt forget Costco overall as I think I mentioned earlier you got to think in terms of Costco's revenue expense cost of credit being basically breakeven for the balance of this year and that's just due to the fact that the way the accounting works you're forced to build loan loss reserves, basically over the first year that you have the portfolio.
Again as we continue to offset the impact of HoldingsÂ run off by a better spreads on our long business is largely due to the interest rate lift that we got, in coming out of December and by the tail-end of the year as we get the Costco of business on our books, that should be another boon to our NIM and weÂre expecting somewhere in the order of a 3 basis point improvement from Costco.
Hello and welcome to CitiÂs First Quarter 2016 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
And while U.S. branded cards showed stronger performance across key indicators, both top and bottom-line results remained lower due to the investments we are making in that business.
The first quarter is historically a strong period for wealth management in Asia with higher transaction activity driving strong investment sales revenues.
Given weak investor sentiment during the quarter, we didnÂt see the typical rebound in transaction activity and therefore our wealth management revenue declined significantly from last year.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion were roughly flat, excluding a $110 million gain on the sale of our Texas branches last year as continued growth in loans in deposit spreads was offset by lower mortgage gain on sale revenues.
Total expenses of $2.5 billion in North America increased 7%, driven by higher repositioning costs and marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings as we continue to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint.
On Slide 9, we show some key performance indicators for North America branded cards including year-over-year growth in average active accounts, average card loans, and purchase sales for our total portfolio.
Growth in average active accounts and purchase sales began to accelerate late last year and these trends are now driving total loan growth as well even as our legacy portfolios continue to shrink.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients as well as improved deposit spreads.
Total market and security services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 15% from last year.
Together, TTS, corporate lending, private bank and security services account for nearly half of total ICG revenues and they grew 7% year-over-year this quarter in constant dollars.
The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink.
So, even though we expect to incur significant additional expenses related to Costco in the second half, we believe our core operating expenses in Citicorp can remain roughly flat sequentially going into the second quarter and then decline somewhat thereafter.

Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
And then next one, I am not sure what you can say but you guys got a very, very favorable living will outcome here this week and some investors pointed the fact that youÂve highlighted a commitment to increasing capital returns in your deck upfront while certainly thatÂs not a new goal for you thinking about CCAR right around the corner.
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
So weÂve got a model in place, we set the businesses with their goals, but if market conditions look as though those revenue environments are not going to come around then weÂll need to take some additional actions hopefully as you said weÂre finished with large repositioning actions.

CITI,q2,2016,"These results are a significant improvement from the first quarter not just in the overall amount of earnings, but in the proportion generated from our core business in Citicorp relative to the assets were winding down in Citi Holdings.
In global consumer banking, we had positive operating leverage in our international franchise, highlighted by solid year-over-year growth in Mexico and continued sequential improvement in Asia.
Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, but expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $634 billion, as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 5% to $938 billion.
In constant dollars, Citicorp revenues were flat to the prior year, as growth in our institutional franchise was offset by lower consumer revenues and the absence of prior period real estate gains in Corp other.
Pre-tax earnings of $5.7 billion in Citicorp were down from last year, but improved over 25% sequentially on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and the lower cost in credit.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew sequentially, but were down 4% from last year, as continued growth in consumer and commercial banking was more than offset by lower mortgage activity.
In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 1% from last year, as a modest benefit from the Costco portfolio, which we acquired on June 17, was offset by the continued impact of higher rewards costs in our existing portfolio, as well as higher payment rates.
The impact of the renewal should lower pre-tax earnings by approximately $50 million per quarter through the end of next year, primarily due to higher expenses, including the amortization of intangibles.
Finally, turning to retail services, revenues of $1.5 billion decreased 4% from last year, reflecting the absence of two portfolios we sold in the first quarter, as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships, principally Home Depot.
We expect revenues to remain around this $1.5 billion level per quarter through the end of next year, as expected volume growth is likely to be offset by the impact of absorbing the more competitive terms in our partnership renewals.
Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America increased 5%, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, as well as continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings.
And finally, credit cards in North America increased 13% from last year, mostly reflecting a reserve building branded cards, driven by volume growth and the impact of Costco compared to a reserve release in the prior period.
In Latin America, consumer revenues were up 4%, as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 7% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards.
Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in the third quarter of last year, we expect this positive operating leverage to continue in the second-half of 2016.
While wealth management revenues were down year-over-year, we did see sequential growth in both revenues and AUM inflows during the quarter, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs, driven by the impact of lower equity market values.
We also saw improvements in card revenues, which were flat to last year, and we continue to believe, we are on track to deliver year-over-year growth in the second-half of 2016.
However, we expect these revenues to stabilize in the second-half of the year with continued growth in higher return personal loans, and therefore, an improvement in the overall yield of the portfolio.
In total, we expect Asia consumer revenues to return to growth in the second-half of 2016, resulting in positive operating leverage year-over-year.
On Slide 8, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans, and revenues.
But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show solid progress in our existing franchise, with organic growth in purchase sales and average loans of 10% and 3%, respectively, and improving year-over-year revenue trend, which we expect to turn positive in the fourth quarter of 2016.
As you can see, the continued impact of our cards initiatives on revenues as well, which should abate as we go into the second-half of the year.
Our expense growth in the first-half was predominantly driven by investments across our franchise, as well as higher repositioning charges in the first quarter, and credit headwinds reflect the absence of prior period reserve releases.
Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 11, revenues of $8.8 billion in the second quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by fixed income and treasury and trade solutions.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients.
Investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 6% from last year, mostly on lower industry-wide equity underwriting activity, but showed a significant improvement from the prior quarter, reflecting a rebound in both market conditions, as well as our wallet share in all major products.
Private bank revenues of $738 million were down 1% year-over-year on lower managed investments and capital markets activity.
The cost of credit related to energy was minimal, as net credit losses were mostly offset by previously existing reserves and the portfolio benefited from the stabilization in oil prices, as well as increased capital markets activity.
Given our target client focus on high-quality corporate credits, certain energy clients were able to access the capital markets as the market environment became more favorable in the second quarter.
Looking forward, we remain cautious and the environment is uncertain, but we could see total ICG cost of credit in the back-half of the year in the range of $300 million to $500 million.
And with the strong second quarter performance in markets, we are now flat to last year in fixed income and equities, but remain down year-over-year in investment banking, given lower overall market activity.
Looking to the second-half of the year, NIM should recover to around 290 basis points or slightly higher, driven by a 3 basis point improvement from Costco, as well as the normalization of average cash balances.
In consumer banking, revenues in North America should grow sequentially, driven by branded cards, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition, which should generate incremental revenues of roughly $200 million over the second quarter.
International consumer revenues should grow modestly from the second quarter, resulting in year-over-year improvement in both Asia and Mexico, excluding the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business last year.
Turning to the institutional business, we expect market revenues to reflect the normal seasonal decline from the second quarter, while investment banking revenues should be largely stable, assuming that market conditions remain favorable.
Core expenses in Citicorp should be slightly down from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of repositioning savings, partially offset by higher expenses related to Costco and other branded cards investments.
And credit costs in Citicorp should be somewhat higher than the second quarter, mostly driven by reserve builds for volume growth and the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition.
The business that weÂre building in branded cards is one that is set to yield in ROA of 225 to 235 basis points, where we were going into the crisis and with a better more higher quality book of business.
But at the same point in time, because the capital markets remained open during the month of June, we did benefit from a lot of our energy clients then being able to access the client, so that produced a much lower cost of credit than I think Mike had probably indicated when he spoke at the conference at the early part of June.
And with the renewals that weÂve done and with the new partnership with Costco, I think that speaks to the type of clients that weÂre really looking to build on.
So I donÂt think that this is more than a one or two quarter blip down in purchase sale growth in Asia.
ItÂs consumer where we had a bit of a slowdown in that momentum, which weÂre now working our way out of, which is why we find getting 4% year-over-year revenue growth to be a nice start positive operating leverage this quarter, positive operating leverage in the back-half of this year.
So, again, if we can execute on the things that we want to execute, create the earnings, continue to liberate the DTA, weÂre going to have a lot of firepower against the stock, and IÂd like to keep investing and making sure, weÂre finding and continuing to build on growth.
And I was just wondering is the prior comments you had made about 58% in Corp for the year still relevant, given the trends that weÂve seen, or is there anything that kind of coming out of the second quarter with the 57 that makes you feel any better about the second-half, I know thereÂs some seasonality?
One last or one for me just in terms your NIM comments and then just that we know that Costco is going to full quarter in the third, itÂs a pretty good line of sight in terms of being able to grow NII from here?
But, yes, we feel very good about the NII, and thatÂs why we feel that the NIM should improve back up to the 290 or maybe a little higher range in the second-half of the year.
And I recognize, John, that you donÂt want to give explicit guidance on balance sheet growth expectations, but with the price of RWAs come down in the quarter and given the growth in both loans and assets, IÂm just trying to get a better handle as to what was driving that.
So youÂre likely to see still weÂll have investment spending in Mexico, but that is captured in the guidance that I gave you as far as our belief of generating positive operating leverage in the second-half of this year and positive operating leverage in consumer in 2017, so thatÂs embedded in that.
But I think the spirit of Mike and I are trying to answer your questions, we donÂt see any large lumpy dollar where weÂre going to tell you that this is going to be some negative impact on our financial performance for the next several quarters.
And I think as Mike said, weÂre obviously been able to do that in billion dollars of utilization over the last couple of years.
But probably sometime over this summer or as we get to the end of the third quarter, weÂll probably come out with some talk about when weÂre going to go up more broadly.
Hello and welcome to CitiÂs Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Good morning and thank you all for joining us.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that todayÂs presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on managementÂs current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
I think weÂve navigated the most recent volatility very well as a result of our strategic client segmentation and strong risk management.
John will now go through the presentation and then weÂd be happy to answer your questions.
Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise and net credit losses declined 5% year-over-year.
Turning now to each business, Slide 5 shows the results from North America consumer banking.
And we remain open to inorganic growth through new programs and acquisition opportunities, given the right strategic fit and return profile.
These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 10%, respectively.
Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region.
The NCL rates in Latin America showed particular improvement this quarter, reflecting seasonal payment trend.
Underlying credit quality has remained stable with the net loss rate declining year-over-year.
We continue to capture market share and saw strong momentum across payment products, such as U.S. dollar clearing, as well as commercial cards, where purchase sales grew 9% year-over-year.
Total markets and security services revenues of $4.7 billion grew 10% from last year.
Total net credit losses were $141 million, with roughly two-thirds offset by related reserve releases.
The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
The funded loan book at the first quarter was 63% investment grade, thatÂs actually improved now to 65%.
And because weÂre concentrated in those high-quality names, they do have access to capital markets and therefore are able to strengthen their balance sheets.
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
I just like Â just want to make sure weÂre growing profitability here and not just volume, important business for you guys?
So, what youÂve seen through the crisis is a Â an impact on ROA first with a severe downturn in ROA, as everybody built reserves and worked their way through the credit issues and then coming out now weÂve all benefited from reserve releases.
But that did since we now are settled for a couple of quarters youÂre going to see the preferred dividend than increase over where they were prior year.
And IÂm wondering if there are limitations on growth or balance sheet allocation that weÂre not thinking about.
And is keeping your surcharge where it is today a bigger priority than potentially growing the balance sheet in a greater way to gain market share, given how volatile that that score can be?
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
It sounds like what youÂre pointing us towards is balance sheet expansion driving NII growth with perhaps a little bit of a lift also from NIM, continued positive operating leverage from lower repositioning costs and some improvement in the provision guidance, although still incremental build, but potentially some lesser degree of trading revenue.
Balance sheet expansion is not really something that weÂre targeting.
IÂm not prepared to give forward guidance on the balance sheet.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
So thereÂs still obviously the execution to do, but it seems like the heavy lifting has been done from an investment point of view.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Looking really at this CCAR cycle, youÂve obviously had some good news in terms of living will, your CCAR proposal was accepted without any change.
Obviously, weÂre still working through the $11 billion portfolio that we have a 11 million new card members, letÂs give them a delightful experience first and then weÂll think about international.
So I would say the pipeline for the third quarter remains pretty strong and provided we get reasonable markets.
And then just finally, your Â obviously your credit quality has improved dramatically and itÂs still very strong.

CITI,q3,2016,"Hello, and welcome to Citi's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Good morning and thank you all for joining us.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
The remainder of our branded cards portfolio as well as retail services also delivered modest revenue growth as did our more focused retail branch network.
Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise, with stable to improving loss rates in every region.
Slide five shows the results for North America Consumer Banking.
These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 12% respectively.
Wealth Management revenues grew 11% from last year on improving investor sentiment and continued positive AUM inflows.
Retail lending revenues remained under pressure as we continued to shift our portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans this quarter.
Slide eight shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail across both cards and retail banking.
Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter in every region.
And Wealth Management revenues continue to recover with improving investor sentiment.
The TTS business remains core to our institutional strategy, delivering integrated solutions to our multinational clients and deepening our operating relationships with them across multiple products and markets.
And Corporate Lending revenues of $450 million also grew 4%, mostly reflecting higher average loans.
While these positions provide an economic hedge and help us manage concentrations to any particular client, sector or region, they are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis.
The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink.
And Investment Banking revenue should be broadly stable sequentially, assuming that market conditions remain favorable.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
I think you've seen a relatively strong calendar on the debt issuance side, which always helps fuel secondary activity, and I think people are now focusing on positioning or repositioning their credit portfolios for an environment in the U.S. of higher rates.
Yes. If you look at the world next year, growth rates globally coming up a bit with probably parts of the emerging markets rebounding better or faster than parts of the developed economies.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
And we thought an additional 3 basis point improvement by normalizing average cash balances.
Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
In our Global Consumer Bank, we saw revenue increases in every business line and geography, excluding the impact of a one-time gain last year in Mexico.
And the backbone of our global network, Treasury and Trade Solutions, generated year-over-year revenue growth for the 11th consecutive quarter despite the low rate environment.
Revenues of $17.8 billion declined 4% from last year, and expenses decreased 2%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well as the impact of foreign exchange translations.
And credit costs improved, reflecting a reduction in the provision for benefits and claims due to asset sales in Citi Holdings as well as lower net credit losses, partially offset by a net reserve build this quarter as compared to a small release in the prior year.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $638 billion and 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 4% to $940 billion.
However, this comparison includes losses on mark-to-market loan hedges this quarter as compared to gains in the prior year as well as certain previously disclosed one-time items that benefited the third quarter of 2015, including a gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico and the reversal of valuation adjustment in our equities business.
Citicorp expenses grew 3%, mostly reflecting volume growth as well as continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings.
Most of the reserve build related to our U.S. Cards franchise, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections, which I'll describe more in a moment.
Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion grew 2% from last year on continued growth in average loans and checking deposits of 9% and 10%, respectively.
We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core six markets, enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank.
And now with the right footprint and infrastructure in place, we are beginning to invest for additional growth by enhancing our segmentation strategy focused on the Citigold wealth management platform, improving our digital and mobile banking capabilities and continuing to upgrade the network with smart branches and dedicated Citigold centers.
Revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15%, reflecting the first full quarter of contribution from the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth.
Excluding Costco, we generated 1% underlying revenue growth as we are beginning to lap the investment program we started last year and a portion of the new balances are maturing to full rate.
Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.6 billion, up 12% from last year, mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and continued marketing investments.
In branded cards, the NCL rate declined to 225 basis points this quarter, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio, which did not incur any losses during the quarter as we had generally excluded late-stage delinquencies from the acquired loans.
Excluding Costco, the NCL rate in branded cards has been in the range of roughly 280 basis points year-to-date.
We expect the loss rate on Costco to be lower than the existing portfolio, but this benefit will likely be offset by the impact of seasoning as well as the estimated impact of the proposed regulatory guidelines I just mentioned.
In retail services, the loss rate has been in the range of around 410 basis points year-to-date, and we expect it to increase to around 435 basis points next year, again, primarily reflecting the impact of seasoning and the proposed regulatory guidelines.
In total, excluding the impact of a one-time gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico last year, revenues grew 4% and expenses were flat to last year.
In Latin America, excluding the prior year gain, consumer revenues were up 5% as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 11% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards.
As Mike mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in our Mexico consumer franchise to drive sustainable growth, with initiatives to enhance our branch network, digital capabilities and service offerings.
We expect to maintain positive operating leverage next quarter and each year throughout the investment period, driven by revenue growth as well as cost savings from upgrading and standardizing our technology platforms.
Consumer revenues grew 3% year-over-year, driven by improvement in Wealth Management and cards, partially offset by the continued repositioning of our retail loan portfolio.
And cards turned positive as well with revenues up 4%, driven by modest volume growth, a continued improvement in yields and abating regulatory headwinds.
And finally, total credit costs grew 13% in our international consumer franchise, reflecting a modest reserve build this quarter compared to our release in the prior year, while loss rates remained favorable.
But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show progress in our existing franchise with organic growth in purchase sales, average loans and revenues this quarter.
As I just noted, in Asia, we have also achieved revenue growth year-over-year, which we expect to continue going forward.
And finally, in Latin America, we achieved growth in both purchase sales and average loans this quarter, but revenues remained down 6% versus last year.
On a comparable basis, card revenues in Latin America would have been down 3% versus last year, reflecting the continued impact of higher payment rates.
With continued growth in purchase sales and average loans, we expect Latin America card revenues to return to sustainable growth in the second half of next year.
The decline in the NCL rate in North America mostly reflects the impact of the Costco portfolio, which, as I mentioned earlier, did not incur any losses this quarter.
However, as our loan portfolio continues to grow in season, we still expect this NCL rate to run closer to 4.5% as we go into next year.
When we presented this slide last quarter, our first half EBIT comparison was affected by several factors, including the comparison to much stronger prior year periods in wealth management, the early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of this year.
We are beginning to lap the impact of our branded cards investments on rebate and rewards costs and saw a full-quarter benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio.
Revenues of $8.6 billion in the third quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by Fixed Income, Investment Banking and Treasury and Trade Solutions.
Private Bank revenues of $746 million were up 4% year-over-year, driven by loan growth, improved spreads and higher managed investment revenues.
Finally, in Securities Services, revenues grew 4% year-over-year as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads more than offset the impact of divestitures.
Given the strong revenue performance this quarter, we're now showing 2% growth on a year-to-date basis in our accrual and transaction services businesses as well as markets and banking.
The most significant year-over-year drag comes from other revenue items, including the impact of the Venezuela devaluation in the first quarter as well as mark-to-mark losses on loan hedges, driven by spread movements.
Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our previous outlook of around 290 basis points as the benefit from Costco and other loan growth was offset by lower trading NIM and higher-than-anticipated cash balances during the quarter as we supported client activity.
In consumer, we expect to continue to generate year-over-year revenue growth in constant dollars across North America, Asia and Latin America, although, sequentially, mortgage activity could be seasonally slower versus the third quarter.
In the institutional franchise, we expect markets to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter, but revenues still should improve year-over-year.
However, we also expect NCLs to be higher as the Costco portfolio begins to incur losses and we continue to see the impact of volume growth.
I think you showed a lot of progress in turning around growth in both international consumer and cards, keeping expenses flat, credits fine, shrinking the share count, all the good stuff.
The results that we're getting on those loan hedges, the large gain in last third quarter and the heavier losses now that we've taken in the second and the third quarter, I think that's more reflective of a wider spread, larger spread movement, then this is the way it's always going to be.
And Glenn, on the spread products side of things, I think what you've seen here is the years progressed and we moved more towards a more likely shift towards higher rates.
And now it's really supporting and driving growth, and a lot of what you've seen is now turning toward is the increase in terms of marketing and really trying to drive volume towards and client acquisition towards those cards.
And that's our goal, is to continue to increase that capital return, as I think Mike said in his opening remarks.
So there's a few things that, I think, Mike and I would like to be able to work our way through before we gave you a specific answer on that question.
This year, given the first quarter revenues, where they were, it's likely to be a little bit higher, maybe 225.
Again, I don't want to say that we're going to stay in that 200 to 225 range next year, but I certainly don't see it growing to 500 basis points, Jim. I think I was doing it as a percentage of expenses.
We feel that the investments that we've talked about in the investment -- in the equities business are largely done and primarily focused on really two key areas, one is an investment in terms of technology, which is critical, certainly to the future of the equities business and second, it's coming out of a resizing, rescaling that we've gone through in our equities business of making sure we've got the right people in the right positions and being out there and getting talent, both internally and externally, into the right seats.
And then on a going-forward basis, the way we're looking at it right now, even with the investment spend that we want to do, we do believe that we'll be able to generate positive operating leverage in our Mexico consumer business in the next couple of years.
We don't see -- again, we think that rates may inch up a little bit next year, but again, we're not seeing anything that would suggest some change in the cycle at this point in time.
And just like with everything else with the Costco portfolio, I think we'll know more and be able to give you a better sense as to sustained run rates of growth, et cetera, over the course of the next two to three quarters.
But again, I think, on a year-to-date basis, we're doing okay and we're in line with where we said we were going to be.

CITI,q4,2016,"Hello, and welcome to Citi's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Citigroup credit costs improved significantly driven by improvement in both ICG and Citi Holdings, partially offset by higher credit costs in consumer reflecting the loan growth as well as the shift from reserve releases last year to reserve builds in North America cards.
Excluding these items, Citicorp revenue increased 3% year-over-year in constant dollars or over $1.7 billion driven by growth in fixed income markets, Treasury and Trade Solutions, North America Card, and Mexico Consumer revenues.
And our operating margin grew by nearly $400 million including the impact of significant investments in our North America cards franchise that have not yet fully matured.
Turning now to each business, Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer banking.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 4% from last year reflecting lower mortgage revenues as well as the impact of certain consumer incentives offered in coordination with the launch of our enhanced retail segmentation strategy.
Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.5 billion, up 6% from last year mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth, and continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings.
In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 8% driven by continued momentum in retail banking with average loans and deposits increasing 7% and 13% respectively.
Credit trends in Asia consumer remains stable this quarter and the NCL rate in Latin America remained favorable at 415 basis points.
While we continue to believe the NCL rate in Latin America should settle closer to 4.5% as the portfolio seasons, it will likely remain below this level for the first half of 2017, reflecting strong credit quality and continued loan delinquency rates.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.1 billion grew 6% in constant dollars driven by continued momentum with new and existing clients.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were flat to last year and higher debt underwriting revenues offset declines in equity underwriting and M&A.
We feel good about the strength of our franchises in fixed income and Investment Banking where clients remain engaged and our results will reflect overall market environment.
Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
I think if you look at the business coming out of the fourth quarter and the momentum we're carrying you could tail that I would choose to split one as I look at our institutional businesses and whether it's rates and currency spread product TTS, Private Bank check them off.
Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet.
Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
And second question is one of your primary competitors mentioned late last year that we could be seeing the bottom in global fixed income pools and you mentioned that the current run rate for fixed income is about 35% from peak although saying that, half of that is permanently gone and IÂm wondering if you contemplate your franchise, do you agree with those numbers in terms of what the potential structural upside could be from here?
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Our final question will come from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet.
In Global Consumer, our U.S. branded cards business continues to see the early benefits from the Costco portfolio and our other cards products also delivered revenue growth.
Revenues of $17 billion in the fourth quarter declined 9% from the prior year and expenses decreased 9% as well each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $624 billion as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 4% to $929 billion.
Pre-tax earnings of $5.1 billion in Citicorp grew by over $1.3 billion year-over-year mostly driven by higher revenues and lower credit costs in our institutional franchise.
We earned a small pre-tax profit in the fourth quarter with revenues, expenses, and cost of credit each declining significantly as we continue to wind down the portfolio.
Turning to branded cards, revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15% reflecting the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition as well as modest organic growth.
To-date, we have generated over 1 million new Costco card accounts and over $52 billion of purchase sales and loans continue to grow in the fourth quarter ending the year at nearly $17 billion.
Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.6 billion were roughly flat to last year as loan growth offset the absence of two portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships.
Net credit losses increased to $1.1 billion mostly driven by Costco, organic volume growth and seasoning, and the impact of regulatory changes on collections and cards and we've built a $113 million of net loan loss reserves during the quarter compared to a release in the prior year driven by the ongoing impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition as well as organic volume growth.
Net income grew significantly from last year on higher revenues, lower operating expenses and stable cost of credit.
Over the past year we have increased net interest revenue as a percentage of average loans in the retail portfolio by 13 basis points, largely offsetting the revenue impact from a 7% decline in average loans driven by mortgages and the runoff of certain non-core products.
We also expect to generate loan growth in cards going forward as we invest to drive higher account acquisition and usage.
The early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio, and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of the year.
Net income of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter grew substantially from last year on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and lower cost of credit.
Citicorp net interest revenues grew 4% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full-year in constant dollars, driven by loan growth as well as the net impact of higher short-term rates.
Looking forward, we believe Citicorp net interest revenue will continue to grow in 2017 with a roughly $500 million impact from the December 2016 rate hike and a $900 million benefit from loan growth and mix including the impact of our card investments maturing in the second half of 2017.
Turning to NIM, our net interest margin of 279 basis points in the fourth quarter declined by roughly 7 basis points sequentially, driven mostly by lower trading NIM, higher funding costs, and the higher mix of promotional rate balances in cards.
And looking to next year, we expect the net interest margin to remain roughly flat to the full-year of 286 basis points as improvement in the core franchise offsets the continued decline in the Legacy Holdings portfolio.
We ended 2016 with a far more favorable backdrop than we started the year, in terms of client engagement, capital markets activity, and commodity prices and we expect the environment to remain broadly favorable going forward.
At a high level, we expect to deliver modest revenue growth and an improved efficiency ratio for total Citigroup, even as we continue to invest in the franchise and wind down the non-core assets that will now be reported in Corp/Other.
In consumer, we expect continued revenue growth and positive operating leverage on a full-year basis in constant dollars in both Asia and Mexico even as we execute on our investment plans for each region.
In the second half we expect growth to be driven organically as our branded cards investments mature and more loans begin to accrue at full rate.
As Mike described earlier, we believe we're on the right path to improve our return on tangible common equity excluding the capital supporting disallowed DTA from 9% in 2016 to at least 10% in 2018 and we should demonstrate progress towards that goal this year as we continue to drive efficiencies across the franchise and begin to see the full benefit of our cards investments in the second half of the year.
I think if you look from a North America perspective, the investments that we made in terms of getting Costco up and going and John talked to the numbers there, $6 billion of loan growth there, $52 billion of purchase sales in the six months and million new customers.
And so by the second half of next year, we should see that really starting to kick in and from the branded cards perspective, again we started those investments and we've seen the revenue growth, we've seen kind of all the positive indicators there but we know that's just a bit of a longer story but the investments we're making in digital and those things across the board feel like we're well-positioned.
There is a very, very small impact of higher rates that we've got baked into 2018 but it's a half-year of a 25 basis point increase so it doesn't really drive a lot.
If you do have this improving efficiency ratio out there it does presume also that you talked about the card loss expectations for this year, but just a broader question on credit in general how much normalization, do you expect, are you anticipating seeing not just from credit from card, but just as the portfolio continues to season with other recent growth that you've seen across the -- across the globe?
Credit costs in our forward look inch up a bit from the 2018 as portfolio season and we have to think that the environment becomes a little weak, but again weÂre not looking, we don't anticipate a significant growth in that credit by 2018, 2019 may be branded cards ticks up somewhat above 300 basis points but it's still well within I think what you would expect a good branded performance to be.
John just wanted to clarify, the outlook for the net interest income dollars that you gave it sounded like may be looking at a net growth of about $1.2 billion in 2017 did I get that right and would that be assuming no more rate hikes?
We made a commitment to use DTA, I remember four, five years ago, some people writing that not only would we never use it, we never stop creating it, and we have and so listen it's progress, it's not as fast as we'd like to go, the environment is not as good as we'd like to have it, it's not an excuse but I think in terms of the things that we've laid out there, we have executed against each of them in this environment, in a disciplined and committed way and that's what we're going to continue to do.
We think that's an important milestone target you to look at obviously Mike we're still, I mean we still believe that this franchise can generate an overall ROTCE up 14%.
And I think Mike was pretty clear on 2018, which is in ROTCE again excluding the DTA capital but it's progress of 10% and during 2017, the expectation is that you're going to see meaningful progress towards that goal.
We continue to wind down holdings and as Mike said, we're going to be increasing the amount of capital that we return each year to our shareholders.
But again, we believe that the investments that we've made and are continuing to make our branded cards franchise as Mike mentioned in Mexico and in Asia that's going to help us significantly close this gap and we expect to show you continuous improvement in GCB's ROTCE each year from this point forward.
And a quick question on the margin guidance you're getting with the 286 for 2017 is the right way to think about that as maybe just in the first quarter of 2017 that the increased investment spend, maybe takes away some of the benefits from the increased in rates in December I guess and I'm trying to get the trajectory over 2017 to understand where and 2017 as a good starting point for 2018.
John, you've alluded to this in over the last 90 minutes but I guess I'm, I just want to get a specific comment from you in terms of, it looks like the capital returns this year of the $12.2 billion you mentioned were roughly little over 80% of your net income and you've clearly set out a path in terms of return on tangible common equity can you give us a little greater level of detail in 2017 and 2018.
We think about it and we speak about it as to John's point there is -- probably really three components to our capital generation there is our earnings, there is our DTA utilization, there is holdings runoff.
And then just finally, John, you mentioned that the Citi Holdings revenues in 2017 should be about half of last year which would be about $1 billion.
",44.11,0.80061764
CITI,q1,2017,"We grew loans and deposits, and achieved an efficiency ratio of just under 58%, a return on assets of 91 basis points and a return on tangible common equity, ex-DTA, of over 10%, in line with our near term targets which were committed to meeting.
Global consumer banking, our U.S. credit card business continued to benefit from the Costco portfolio, although we did see lower mortgage revenues.
Internationally, we again posted revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Asia and Mexico, and we continued our investment plan in Mexico to drive improved efficiency and returns.
Net income grew 17% to $4.1 billion in the first quarter, driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit.
Revenues of $18.1 billion grew 3% from the prior year, reflecting growth in both our consumer and institutional businesses, offset by lower revenues and Corporate/Other, as we continued wind down legacy assets.
And cost of credit decline significantly, driven by a $230 million reserve release this quarter in ICG, as compared to a build in the prior year related to the energy sector.
Consumer cost and credit increased year-over-year, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio and other volume growth, as well as the continued impact of changes in collection processes in U.S. cards.
Mortgage revenues declined by roughly $80 million year-over-year, reflecting lower origination activity and higher cost of funds, as well as the impact of the previously announced sale of a portion of our mortgage servicing rights.
Turning to branded cards, revenues of $2.1 billion grew 13%, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition and modest organic growth, offset by the impact of day count.
Looking at the total portfolio, despite the normal pay down you would expect in the first quarter, our full rate revolving balances remained stable sequentially.
And we continued to expect growth in these full rate revolving loans in the second half of the year as our investments mature.
From here, we expect yields to improve, driven by rate increases as well as the growth in full rate revolving balances in the second half of the year.
Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.6 billion were down 5%, driven mostly by the absence of gains on the sale of two small portfolios in the first quarter of last year.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were $2.6 billion, up 3% from last year, mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth, and continued investments, partially offset by efficiency savings and lower repositioning cost.
Net credit losses increased to $1.2 billion, mostly driven by Costco organic volume growth and seasoning, as well as the impact of changes in collection processes and cards.
But given normal seasonal improvement in delinquencies, we continue to expect the full year NCL rate to be around 435 basis points.
In Latin America, total consumer revenue grew 4%, driven by an 8% growth in retail banking, reflecting continued growth in average loans and deposits, as well as improved deposit spread.
However, card revenue declined from last year, reflecting lower revolving loans, as well as a higher cost to fund non-revolving balances.
The NCL rate in North America increased from last quarter, as I described earlier, but should trend lower for the remainder of the year as the Costco conversion related losses are now behind us and we should benefit from normal seasonality.
Credit trends in Asia consumer remained stable this quarter and the NCL rate in Latin America was 4.4%, up somewhat from the prior quarter, mostly driven by lower loan growth but still in line with our near term outlook.
Net income of $3 billion grew substantially from last year on higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 39% from last year, reflecting a rebound in debt and equity underwriting and our continued momentum in M&A.
As you can see, total net interest revenue declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars to $10.9 billion, as growth in core accrual revenues was more than offset by the wind down of legacy assets as well as lower trading related net interest revenue.
Turning to our Core Accrual businesses, net interest revenues of $9.5 billion were up 3% or $280 million from last year, driven by the addition of the Costco portfolio, other volume growth, and the impact of the December 2016 rate hike, partially offset by lower day count and increase in our FDIC assessment and higher long term debt.
On a sequential basis, Core Accrual revenues decline as the benefit of higher interest rates was more than offset by the impact of lower day count, loan mix and rate positioning actions.
Starting in consumer, in North America, revenue growth this quarter should continue to be mostly inorganic, driven by a full quarter of revenue contribution from the Costco portfolio which we acquired in June of last year.
And internationally, we continue to expect modest year-over-year revenue growth in constant dollars with positive operating leverage in both Asia and Mexico.
And we like to investment we said that weÂve made in both the people and the platforms in equities; we've got balance sheet to put to work; we think that we've been gaining share with our targeted clients; and I think youÂre starting to see some of that activity coming through now, it's one quarter.
You should be able to see it, both in revenue growth and also improved cost of credit, especially as we lap some of the very high cost of credit numbers that we had in the second half of last year as we were building up loan loss reserves for Costco, in connection with the purchase accounting, so those factors.
And again as I said in my opening remarks, youÂll look at what weÂve done here in terms of capital return and yet our ratios continue to go up; and so this quarter generating $5.5 billion of regulatory capital.
And again, I think our story is one where weÂve talked about, you can map out what looks like a, at this point, a fairly typical sequential ICG year; again with good momentum, and as we see things right now; and then, obviously, talking about the back half story in terms of consumer.
Yes, I want to make sure, I didn't say it was over, I said that the regulatory headwinds were abating which they had and that's actually been what you've seen in the numbers now over the last couple of quarters, as we continue to have nice yield, modest year-over-year revenue growth, 3% this quarter.
And then on the credit quality, in the branded card, I think you mentioned Costco collections changes the collection process, seasoning what not, influencing the numbers this quarter.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
While our results were impacted by one-time gains, we increased revenues in both our consumer and institutional lines of business, while maintaining our expense discipline.
Our Markets business performed very well with revenue up 17% year-over-year, comprised of 19% increase in fixed income and 10% increase in equities, another area weÂve been investing in.
Expenses were roughly flat as the impact of higher performance related compensation and higher business volumes, was offset by lower repositioning cost.
As previously announced, our result this quarter included a charge of nearly $400 million related to the exit of our U.S. mortgage servicing operations.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $629 billion as 5% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
Turning now to each business, slide four shows the results for North America Consumer Banking.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 3% from last year, driven by lower mortgage revenues.
Excluding mortgage, Retail Banking revenues were up 5%, driven by continued growth in average loans deposits and assets under management.
Net income grew 12% from last year on higher revenue and slightly lower operating expenses partially offset by higher cost on credit.
Card revenues grew 6%, driven by higher volumes and improved revolve rates versus last year.
Treasury and Trade Solution revenues of $2.1 billion grew 9%, driven by strong fee growth, higher volumes and improved spreads.
Private Bank revenues of $744 million grew 9% year-over-year, mostly driven by loan and deposit growth and improved spreads.
And Corporate Lending revenues of $434 million were down 3% from last year on lower average volumes.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.8 billion grew 18% from last year.
Assuming one additional rate hike mid-year, Core Accrual revenues should grow year-over-year by roughly $1.5 billion in total over the next three quarters, with just under two thirds of that amount coming from higher rates and the reminder mostly reflecting higher loan volumes and mix.
However, this will likely be offset by lower mortgage revenues versus the prior year.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Very rough math, John, 25 basis points rate hike should impact revenues positively by about $100 million for each full quarter that it's in effect.
What I said during the prepared remarks was that we expect the Core Accrual interest revenue to grow year-over-year by about $1.5 billion during the next three quarters, again assuming one more rate hike somewhere around midyear.
Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Now the prior guidance that we had given of $1.2 billion had included trading related net revenue.

",51.62,0.63747823
CITI,q2,2017,"During the quarter, we saw continued momentum in our businesses with loan and revenue growth across both sides of our house.
In global consumer banking, our US retail bank showed significant growth outside of mortgage operations and we saw a 10% revenue growth in branded cards driven by the Costco portfolio.
Revenues of $17.9 billion grew 2% from the prior year reflecting 5% growth in our consumer and institutional businesses offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other as we continue to wind down legacy assets.
Expenses were up slightly as higher volume related expenses, performance based compensation, and ongoing investments were largely offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, and cost of credit increased, mostly driven by lower reserve releases versus the prior year as well as higher volumes and NCL rates in consumer.
Looking at the first half of 2017, total revenues grew 3% year over year including 7% growth in our consumer and institutional businesses.
Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year over year to $645 billion as 4% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
On a sequential basis, we saw particular strength in loan growth this quarter with an increase of $16 billion in our core businesses that was broad-based across regions and products.
Mortgage revenues declined by roughly $90 million year over year reflecting lower origination activity and higher cost of funds as well as the impact of the previously announced sale of a portion of our mortgage servicing rights.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues were up 7%, driven by continued growth in average loans, deposits, and assets under management as well as a benefit from higher interest rates.
Turning to branded cards, revenues of 2.1 billion grew 10% reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition as well as modest organic growth in our core portfolios, partially offset by the continued runoff of non-core portfolios.
Average full rate balances were stable quarter over quarter and we continue to expect growth in these full rate revolving loans with the resulting improvement in yields in the second half of the year as our investments mature.
Net credit losses increased to 1.2 billion, driven by the Costco portfolio, organic volume growth, and seasoning as well as the impact of collections activity in retail services.
And we continue to expect NCL rates to be seasonally lower in the second half of the year, consistent with the trend we saw in the month of June.
In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 8% driven by a 12% increase in retail banking reflecting continued growth in average loans and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads.
And while retail lending revenue declined versus last year, we saw sequential growth in both revenues and average loans this quarter driven by personal loans.
Total international credit cost grew by $70 million year over year, mostly reflecting reserve builds in the current quarter to support volume growth in Latin America as compared to a net release in the prior year.
Private bank revenues of 788 million, grew 17% year over year, mostly driven by loan and deposit growth, improved spreads and increased investment activity.
Core accrual net interest revenue of 10 billion was up 7% or over $600 million from last year driven by the addition of the Cosco portfolio, organic volume growth, and the impact of rate increases, partially offset by an increase in our FDIC assessment and higher long-term debt.
On a sequential basis, core accrual revenue grew by over $200 million this quarter reflecting day count, the impact of the March rate increase and loan growth.
Starting with consumer, in North America, our investments in retail banking are delivering results with revenues excluding mortgage growing by 6% year over year in the first half.
Retail services revenues continue to outperform our original outlook for a run rate of $1.5 billion per quarter this year, driven by higher than anticipated loan growth.
In Asia, we generated year over year revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the fourth straight quarter, driven by strength in cards and wealth management.
And in Mexico, we also generated revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the fifth straight quarter reflecting momentum in retail banking.
As we look to the third quarter in North America consumer, we expect continued year over year revenue growth in retail banking excluding mortgage as well as modest organic growth in cards as we grow full rate balances.
And turning to the institutional side, we expect continued year over year revenue growth in our accrual businesses, including PPS, security services, and the private bank.
And then John has set up our expectations for the second half and feel the combination of the levers we have, John, between some revenue growth, between continued expense discipline, and a reasonable environment around cost of credit and obviously meaningful capital return gives us the pathway to hitting those.
So that's going to be one of the critical drivers, and we'll take you through those details on Investor Day. We'll look forward to that and then maybe one just quickie on the quarter here John, it looks like for the first half of the year, the DTA utilization has been about 900 million for the first half, a little bit more in the first quarter than the second.
but again, 8% growth - revenue growth coming out of Mexico in a country that's growing sub 2, again, I think illustrating what we've talked about that we believe over the intermediate longer term, we've got the ability to grow our international front franchises at or in many cases at multiples the pace of domestic growth rates, and the other piece if you look in there is that in Mexico, it's the combination of our retail business in Asia, it is wealth management.
And that's a combination of things, as Mike said, its good engagement with the clients, youÂre seeing the results of a lot of the repositioning actions that we've been taking and as we reposition portfolios, we started to focus on different types of lending.
So we you know we are assuming that as rate increases occur and as the Fed does wind down its balance, we will see betas increase slightly in our corporate side business, but we do not have anything major put into the outlook for the second half of this year.
And my second question and I expect that maybe some of this would be deferred to your Investor Day, but given how much capital that you generate, even if we assume that you can continue to increase your payout from here, you clearly are still well over where you think a normal level of capital would be that's appropriate for your business.
But again, we continue to expect to see good growth rates in no particular order in terms of our TTS businesses, what we're doing in the private bank across our retail franchises, around the globe again with an emphasis on things we're doing here in the US and we're going to talk about that quite a bit in terms of Investor Day, the cards investments we've made.
If you take a look, as I mentioned, our loans are growing nicely in that business right now and we're still seeing very good customer engagement with our retail partner cards.
It does feel to us like the 150 basis points of cushion that you are assuming within your 11.5% target is very conservative and I recognize that it's going to be a multi-year process for you to take your 13% today and bring that down to 11.5% over time, but has your thinking changed or evolved at all with regards to your capital targets?
You guys showed your pretty good loan growth and -- but yet, you did mention that loan yields were down a little bit and you had some mix as far as the NIM is concerned, but I'm just wondering can you help us distill whether the [indiscernible] loan yields was related to the ongoing corporate other runoff and/or is there just a different mix in terms of, it looks like it's card that's growing the most.
So when we look at the decline in FIC revenues, again, year-over-year, in the second quarter, it's really, the lion's share of it is being driven by G10 FX is reflecting a low volatility that I think everyone has spoken about in the market.
Hello, and welcome to Citi's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Internationally, we had continued revenue growth in both regions; Latin America where we've been investing in Citibanamex has now had revenue growth and positive operating leverage for five straight quarters.
While trading revenues were down 7% from the prior period, which had benefited from a surge of activity following the UK referendum, our banking results were excellent.
Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 2% from last year driven by lower mortgage revenues.
WeÂre continuing to see positive results from the launch of our enhanced Citigold wealth management offering last year, driving growth in both households and balances with higher penetration on investment products.
Finally, retail services revenues of 1.6 billion were 4% reflecting loan growth and a favorable prior period comparison.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were $2.6 billion, up 6% from last year reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth, and continued investments partially offset by efficiency savings.
However, given the lower collections rate, our full-year NCL rate in retail services will likely be around 460 basis points versus our prior outlook of 435 basis points.
And expenses grew 4% in Latin America reflecting ongoing investment spending and business growth, partially offset by efficiency savings.
Higher card revenues reflecting 6% growth in average loans and 7% growth in purchase sales versus last year as well a modest gain from the sale of our merchant acquiring businesses in certain countries.
Treasury and trade solutions revenues of 2.1 billion grew 3% or 4% in constant dollars, driven by continued volume growth and improved deposit spreads.
While average loans were down modestly year over year, we saw good sequential growth, with volumes up 3% supporting core business activity among our global subsidiary clients.
Fixed income revenues of 3.2 billion, declined 6%, primarily reflecting lower G10 currencies revenues given lower volatility in the current quarter and a comparison to higher Brexit related activity a year ago.
Equities revenues were 11% lower versus last year reflecting episodic activity in the prior period as well as low volatility.
Investor client activity in equities remain strong however, with cash equities up year over year as well as continued growth in prime finance revenue and client balances.
Total operating expenses of 5 billion were up 5% year over year as higher incentive compensation, investments and volume related expenses were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Slide 9 shows our net interest revenue and margin insurance split by core accrual revenue, trading related revenue and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corporate/Other.
However, we still saw decline in the core accrual net interest margin to 344 basis points reflecting higher cash balances.
Market revenues will likely reflect a normal modest seasonal decline from the second quarter and investment banking revenues will likely return to a level closer to the first quarter perhaps a little lower assuming a seasonal slowdown in the third quarter underwriting activity.
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.
And we're running a little bit below that right now and I would anticipate probably for the full year legal and repositioning costs are probably going to come in somewhere around maybe 25 basis points less than we had originally guided.
Wanted to get along as just how the general struggles of traditional offline retailers might be affecting or affect that business in the future, maybe I'll start there and then I have a couple more detailed follow-ups.
It's hard to manage somebody from a client relationship when you've got one system that has their retail deposits, another one that has their credit card and another one that has their mortgage, another one that has their investment assets.
",44.11,0.56075376
CITI,q3,2017,"We have revenue increases in many of the product areas we have been investing in, tightly managed our expenses, and again saw loan and deposit growth in both our consumer and institutional businesses.
We've made progress towards the targets we discussed on Investor Day in terms of ROTCE 9.8% ex-DTA year-to-date and efficiency ratio of 57% year-to-date and we also returned over 6 billion of capital to our shareholders this quarter.
Turning to our businesses, in global consumer banking we generated revenue growth and positive operating leverage in all three regions Asia, Latin America, and North America.
In the U.S. retail banking and retail services both had growth and while we didn't see the year-over-year revenue growth weÂd anticipated in branded cards, we did show good sequential growth at 5% driven by growth in full rate balances and strong client engagement.
Revenues of $18.2 billion grew 2% from the prior year reflecting the gain on sale as well as 3% total growth in our consumer and institutional businesses.
The reserve build in cards was comprised of roughly $150 million for volume growth and normal seasoning in the portfolios, $50 million related to the estimated impact of the hurricanes, and about $300 million to cover our forward-looking NCL expectations.
Private Bank revenues of 785 million grew 15% year-over-year driven by growth in clients, loans, investment activity and deposits, as well as improved spreads.
Core accrual net interest revenue of 10.4 billion was up 5% or $450 million from last year driven by the impact of higher rates and volume growth, partially offset by a higher level of long-term debt.
On a sequential basis core accrual revenue grew by nearly $350 million this quarter reflecting day count, the impact of the June rate increase, loan growth, and mix.
Year-to-date core accrual revenue grew by $1.5 billion year-over-year and we expect to see roughly $500 million of additional growth in the fourth quarter.
However, on a full year basis we expect this increase to be offset by a roughly $900 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy wind down portfolio in Corporate/Other.
As we look to the fourth quarter, in consumer we expect continued modest year-over-year revenue growth and positive operating leverage in both North America and international consumer.
On the institutional side we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in our accrual businesses including TTS, the private bank, corporate lending, and security services.
And based upon the performance of the earlier vintages we expect these promotional balances will generate growth and full rate balances but, in the near-term we're seeing a dampening effect on revenues caused by this shift in focus.
And while the higher rates are overall accretive to the U.S. consumer business we've also talked about the fact that higher funding rates increase the near-term revenue drag caused by promotional balances.
Now as late as June we believe that despite the drag of the higher promo balances and the higher funding rates we'd still be in position to deliver at least some level of year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. brand cards beginning in the third quarter.
And then finally in branded cards we're looking at an NCL rate of about 10 basis point growth next year and that will go from about 285 this year to 295 next year.
So all things being equal I'd expect that the fourth quarter reserve build would be back in that range of $50 million to $100 million in branded cards that we would consider to be more normal.
And then again as we look forward and we think about the NCL rate next year being 30 to 35 basis points higher than what we had previously thought about, again you take 30 to 35 basis points, multiply it by a current $46 billion portfolio, adjust that for a 14 to 15 month coverage period and that gets you the extra $200 million reserve build there.
And just one quick strategic question on retail services, is this a portfolio and a business that you're looking to grow, do you see that growing or adding new partners or growth within the existing partners or is it something that probably feels pretty stable over the next few years?
So we think it's a really good business and unfortunately with those performance sharing arrangements that tend to obscure the true revenue trends and even in the near-term economics we end up having to build the loan loss reserves for all the NCL's that we're going to incur in that business even though some of those NCLs ultimately as theyÂre realized will go into the performance sharing arrangement and so it's actually our partners that will actually bear a significant percentage of those NCLs. John McDonald
If you remember Jim when we, as we've been talking about growth in net interest revenue year-over-year we've been focused on that core accrual line and we said that in the second half of the year we would expect that to grow about a billion dollars year-over-year and we saw a $450 million in the third quarter and we're looking at $500 million in the fourth quarter.
Just maybe a last one on this consumer credit issue, I mean when we looked at the medium term global consumer banking net loss rate you gave at Investor Day of 2.20 to 2.40, is everything you're seeing right now not just in retail card but pulling up across all the businesses is still consistent with that ranges, some of this pushing the range, what would be your mark-to-market on that to 2.20 to 2.40 guidance?
If I could just one last one in equities and security services, I know both are areas where youÂve invested for some time now, when you look at the recent momentum any sense of how much of that is market share and client gains versus how much of that is the backdrop?
So combining both elements of our equities franchise, we've got a growing and balanced business with good momentum going with both our corporate as well as our investor clients.
So we feel that what the quarter talks about, what year-to-date talks about is the balance and breadth of revenue growth and you can see the positive operating leverage across really almost all our business lines.
Mike I want to ask you a question going back to your opener, we've seen the metrics on the global growth start to improve mid single-digits year-over-year consumer and in some of the institutional businesses and I just want to a lot of enthusiasm for the emerging markets rebound that we've seen broadly speaking, you mentioned that the potential for the global disruption, can you just talk us through just like business momentum in the non-U.S. markets and maybe just touch on a couple of the biggest ones as well just to give us an understanding of kind of where we are in terms of that just organic growth improvement and where you might be worried about a little bit of a pause?
Well, the target that we set at the beginning of the year it includes all the expenses and all the revenue that we have when you take a look at how that $580 million gain is going to impact us.
Okay, fair enough, the second question on the overall health of the consumer, you talked about moving up your loss ratios from 470 million to 500 million and the longer-term changing, we are seeing increases in losses in an environment where you do have a very strong labor market, unemployment coming down.
So I'm curious as to how you're feeling just more broadly about the health of the consumer overall especially if we do start to see at some point down the line in the coming years some change in the labor market environment and do you think there is some risk in the medium-term to the losses, the expectations that you have in some parts of your consumer business?
Now the one thing that we know about cards is in trying to build this balanced portfolio with the balance business we're going to need to make adjustments as we go along every quarter.
You know we normally don't give too much guidance on the backlog but I think that you've seen that in the forward guidance that we've given towards the fourth quarter where we sort of said the investment banking revenues in the fourth quarter we expect to be pretty much on where we were in the third quarter.
But the retail banking revenues up 12% year-over-year, yes, that is getting a little bit a lift from interest rates but it still is good growth.
And now we've got cards revenues in Mexico that are actually have growth year-over-year.
Investor Day we said our anticipation is compound annual growth rate in revenues of 10%, we had been running at about 7% to 8%, we will probably be back to that 7% to 8% in the fourth quarter and then we should continue to grow into 2018 and 2019.
We like the wealth management business that we've got in Asia and again in both of those businesses five consecutive quarters of revenue growth and positive operating leverage.
And I talked about the retail banks so I think we've got really three good engines for growth in the future there in the consumer business.
Hello, and welcome to Citi's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Thank you Susan and good morning everyone.
And while tax reform remains a question mark we do like the direction the administration is going in terms of regulation which we see as just a course to accommodate higher growth rather than a full scale regulatory repeal agenda.
Hey, thanks Mike and good morning everyone.
Net income of $4.1 billion in the third quarter grew 8% from last year including a $580 million pretax gain on the sale of yield book, a fixed income analytics business which benefited EPS by $0.13 per share.
And cost of credit increased mostly reflecting volume growth, seasoning, hurricane and earthquake related loan loss reserve builds and additional reserve builds in North America cards which I'll cover in more detail shortly.
In constant dollars Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to 653 billion as 4% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 12% driven by continued growth in loans and assets under management as well as the benefit from higher interest rates.
Full rate revolving balances which had been flat since the beginning of the year began to grow this quarter as new loan vintages matured and started to accrue interest.
Total expenses for North America in consumer were $2.5 billion down 5% from last year as higher volume related expenses and investments were more than offset by efficiency savings.
Card revenues grew slightly year-over-year on continued improvement in full rate revolving loan trends.
And expenses also grew 4% in Latin America reflecting ongoing investment spending and business growth partially offset by efficiency savings.
Higher card revenues reflected 6% growth in average loans and 7% growth in purchase sales versus last year.
Total international credit costs grew 4% year-over-year mostly reflecting volume growth and seasoning in Latin America.
Turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 7, revenues of $9.2 billion grew 9% from last year reflecting the previously mentioned gain on sale as well as continued solid progress across the franchise.
Fixed income revenues of 2.9 billion declined 16% on lower G10 rates and currencies revenues given low volatility in the current quarter and the comparison to higher Brexit related activity a year ago as well as lower activity in spread products.
Total operating expenses of 4.9 billion increased 5% year-over-year as investments and volume related expenses were partially offset by efficiency savings.
As you can see total net interest revenue declined slightly from last year to 11.4 billion as growth in core accrual revenue was outpaced by the wind down of legacy assets as well as lower trading related net interest revenue.
In the third quarter our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 13% as net income was more than offset by $6.4 billion of common share buybacks and dividends.
Market revenues will likely reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter.
I think it's an area John if opportunities present themselves as we've seen in Best Buy and other and if portfolios make sense we clearly got the capital balance sheet, liquidity capacity, and if the returns makes sense weÂd be happy to take them on.
Thanks and then maybe a question I get a lot, I know it's a little bit of a lost cause to forecast trading related NII -- I can't be forecasting rating so, but like why is it down across the whole industry not just you so much, is it just simply trading books are liability sensitive so, there's a little bit of give back there or why are we seeing these trade related NII numbers come under so much pressure?
Thanks, I wanted a very small minor item but when you look at your security gains you've had about $200 million per quarter, as rates are kind of generally moving higher just to know if you were trying to reposition or do some things in that particular portfolio by taking those gains.
I have a question, obviously and I don't mean to sell short the efforts you have made in capital markets because you've done a great job in investing in your businesses and you showed us today like you did Investor Day gaining the wallet shift.
Again going back we focused a number of years ago around what we said growth is going to look and feel like for us is not a whole lot of new client acquisition.

CITI,q4,2017,"As you know, our net income for the fourth quarter and the year reflect the impact of the onetime non-cash charge due to tax reform and I'll go into some more detail about that after I discuss our business performance.
We did have a decline in Markets revenue due to a less robust environment this quarter than in the period following the US election last year, but engagement remains strong with our target clients.
Revenue growth and strong expense management brought us to a full year efficiency ratio of 57.7%, an improvement of over 150 basis points from 2016.
Starting on Slide 3, before we go into our operating results, I do want to spend a few minutes on the impact of tax reform on our fourth quarter as well as the benefits we expect going forward.
As noted on the table, our fourth quarter results included a onetime non-cash charge of $22 billion or $8.43 per share comprised of roughly $19 billion due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets or DTA arising from the lower US corporate tax rate as well as the shift to a territorial regime and roughly $3 billion related to the deemed repatriation of un-remitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
On an ongoing basis, we expect to benefit from a lower effective tax rate, going from the low 30% range down to an estimated 25% rate in 2018 with a line of sight to a 24% rate over the next 2 years.
And finally, the combination of a lower tax rate and, therefore, higher net income along with the $22 billion reduction in our tangible common equity is expected to drive a material improvement in returns, adding roughly 200 basis points to our RoTCE going forward.
On this basis, net income was $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from the prior year, and earnings per share of $1.28 grew 12%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.
Revenues of $17.3 billion grew 1% from the prior year, reflecting 2% aggregate growth in our Consumer and Institutional businesses offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other as we continued to wind down legacy assets.
On a full year basis, total revenues grew 2% in 2017, including 6% aggregate growth in our Consumer and Institutional businesses.
Total expenses remained flat, driving over 150 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio to just under 58%, and net income grew 6%, resulting in a 13% increase in earnings per share, including the impact of share buybacks.
Our RoTCE, excluding the impact of disallowed DTA, improved to 9.6% in 2017, showing good progress towards our original Investor Day target of a 10% return on this basis in 2018.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 5% year-over-year to $667 billion as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
In Global Consumer Banking, we generated 4% revenue growth and nearly 100 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio.
Of course, our ICG results benefited from a gain on sale in the third quarter, but even excluding the gain, we generated 6% revenue growth and over 100 basis points of efficiency improvement in 2017.
From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 14% driven by continued growth in checking deposits and deposit margin, growth in investments and loans and increased commercial banking activity.
We continued to generate growth in total interest-earning balances this quarter, up about 4% year-over-year, excluding our Hilton portfolio, as recent vintages continued to mature as expected, partially offset by the runoff of non-core balances.
As we look forward, we expect interest earning balances to continue to grow while promotional rate loans should stabilize and then begin to decline in 2018 as we continue to take actions to adjust our acquisition strategy in a rising rate environment.
Net credit losses grew by 7% year-over-year and we built roughly $150 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning in the portfolios.
Net income grew 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter driven by revenue growth, positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline.
And card revenues grew by 11%, reflecting continued growth in average loans and purchase sales as well as a modest gain on the sale of a merchant acquiring business.
Private Bank revenues of $771 million grew 15% year-over-year driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits as well as improved spreads.
Fixed Income revenues of $2.4 billion declined 18%, reflecting continued low volatility as well as the comparison to a more robust trading environment last year in the wake of the US elections.
For the full year 2017, our net income grew 16% on the combination of revenue growth, positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline.
In Fixed Income, while the trading environment proved to be challenging this year with low volatility and fewer macro catalysts, we continued to see strong engagement with our corporate clients as they leveraged our global network, particularly in rates and currencies.
Core accrual revenues grew year-over-year by over $500 million in the fourth quarter, in line with our outlook, but this was offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the anticipated wind down of legacy assets.
On a full year basis, core accrual revenue grew by $2 billion over 2016, again, in line with our outlook.
As we look to 2018, we expect core accrual net interest revenues to grow by another $2.5 billion year-over-year driven by loan growth, mix improvement and the benefit of higher rates assuming one additional Fed rate increase mid year.
In the fourth quarter, our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12.3% driven by $6.3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, as well as the estimated $6 billion reduction in CET1 capital due to tax reform, which, as I noted earlier, had a roughly 40 basis point impact.
For the full year 2018, we expect top line growth broadly in line with the medium term outlook we described in July at around 3%, plus or minus, with stronger growth in our operating businesses being offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets.
This combination of higher earnings before tax, continued capital return and the impact of tax reform is expected to drive a significant improvement in RoTCE in 2018.
Excluding the impact of tax reform, our return on total tangible common equity improved to roughly 8% in 2017 and we expect to make additional progress this year.
I think the rule of thumb, John, would be that for each additional quarter that we had an incremental 25 basis point rate - impact of - a Fed rate hike, we should see an increment of about $80 million of core interest revenue.
Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and that inflection in Mexico Consumer, as well as Asia on a core basis and maybe what kind of revenue growth expectations you might have on the International Consumer front?
I'd say that from a medium-term point of view, John, what we're seeing now gives us confidence in those projections that we put forward for Investor Day. So I don't want you to think that we are upping the guidance from Investor Day. But with this performance, as I mentioned, let's stay with Mexico cards.
It was lessening, but we wouldn't think that we were going to return to year-over-year revenue growth until the fourth quarter of this year.
If you think about it, what this means is we put up, I think, at Investor Day a compound annual growth rate for U.S. branded cards over the 3.5-year period was going to be 3%.
At the same point in time, retail services, we had, I think a 1% compound annual growth rate built in and we feel pretty good now about that looking more like a 2% growth rate.
All in all, a pretty good trade-off and that gives you some idea as that - why we're seeing - why we're talking about this strong improvement in our overall ability to generate and, therefore, return capital.
We're actually -- if you do -- if you continue to do the math, though, I talked about the fact that we're getting a 900 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate in 2020.
And if you actually do the math on that, you're going to scratch your head and say, well, wait a minute, this looks like a 900 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate should actually drive a much higher improvement to RoTCE than the 200 basis points that Mike and John are talking about.
But I think, John, if you look at it as an example, fee growth, where you think of where we've seen good growth, Matt, is when you look in the banking products, when you look at, as John talked about, market share gains in M&A, you look at what we've done in terms of the private bank, securities services, lending, those more accrual type revenues have been strong.
As an example, when you look at the Mexico investment that we've made, which I think we clearly have to acknowledge as having been helpful in terms of the 6% revenue growth in Mexico today, you look at 3 things there.
I think there's nothing really outside of what we've described, but a big emphasis towards digital, towards technology, towards new and smart banking as we go forward and then, obviously, continued investments in place like our TTS businesses and all the things that we've talked about.
So what we said is think in terms of the gain that we book in the first quarter will basically offset the revenue loss of Hilton for the balance of the year.
I think, right now, growth forecasts look like Mexico is probably going to come in somewhere around 2.1%.
And you have $2 billion of core accrual net interest revenue growth for the full year, $520 million of that in the fourth quarter.
The other thing I was going to ask you was we've talked a lot about the improvement in returns and earnings as you go forward but not a lot about reduction in the tangible book value as you change the DTA this quarter.
Hello and welcome to Citi's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
The Institutional Clients Group saw continued momentum with double-digit growth in its banking products comprised of TTS, Investment Banking, Private Bank and Corporate Lending.
Not only do we remain committed to returning at least $60 billion of capital during the current and next 2 CCAR cycles, obviously subject to regulatory approval, but we feel confident about our ability to generate capital going forward.
From a business perspective, it's a great opportunity to advise our clients on how they can optimize their models to fit the new tax regime.
Tax reform could change the sentiment among those making investment decisions from optimism to confidence and become the boost the US economy needs to drive growth higher.
The U.S. consumer should also benefit as higher take-home pay could drive either increased discretionary spending or the acceleration of payment of existing debt, each a potential positive outcome from the reduction in tax rates.
We believe the combination of higher income and reduced tangible common equity will have a meaningful positive impact on our returns, improving return on tangible common equity by about 200 basis points going forward.
In all, tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns, but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward.
These results include a combined net benefit of roughly $0.08 per share from discrete items that resulted in a lower than expected tax rate, as well as a onetime loss in discontinued operations.
Expenses were flat year-over-year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets.
Slide 6 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
Total revenues of $8.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year with positive operating leverage in both North America and our international franchise.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were flat to last year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were offset by efficiency savings.
We continue to drive transaction volumes to lower cost channels and digital engagement remains strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users, including 21% growth among mobile users versus last year.
Retail banking revenues grew 7% in the fourth quarter with broad-based volume growth across deposits, commercial loans and personal loans, as well as improved deposit spreads.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.2 billion were up 9%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with balanced growth across net interest and fee income.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 10% from last year with wallet share gains for the year across debt and equity underwriting and M&A.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.4 billion declined 17% from last year.
Excluding this item, Equities revenues declined by 4% from last year, reflecting lower activity in corporate equity derivatives, while investor client engagement remains strong.
And finally, credit costs were $267 million in the fourth quarter, predominantly driven by the same single client event, while overall portfolio quality remains strong.
Securities Services grew 8% as we continued to deepen client relationships while also benefiting from the higher rate environment.
And trading related net interest revenue declined by nearly $1.7 billion year-over-year with about 2/3 of this decline coming from higher wholesale funding costs.
And trading related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment.
In terms of earnings power, the macro backdrop has only gotten stronger with all major global markets having returned to growth and the US poised to benefit from a more competitive tax regime.
In the US, while branded cards has gotten off to a slow start, likely delaying growth in that business until 2019, we showed good traction with our Citigold Wealth Management investment and retail services is growing at slightly above our medium-term outlook.
And while there are lots of moving pieces, we believe our ability to generate regulatory capital has only improved post tax reform as higher net income should more than offset any reduction in our annual DTA utilization.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.
And you mentioned overall, even with US card being a little light, your overall Consumer revenue trajectory feels good relative to the Investor Day targets?
Yes. I don't think we ever talked about a very specific 2018 goal at that point, but getting another 100 basis point reduction fits in with the pace that we had built into that Investor Day presentation.
Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Yes. I think John's talked about a backdrop where we'll see trading remains choppy.
Next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Yes, if you take a look at the - I'm not quite sure that there's a norm because each product has got its own offering.
Our next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
Our next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS.
Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
Yes, just wanted to understand whether you think about pricing is actually going a bit lower.
If you have any questions, please reach out to Investor Relations.

CITI,q1,2018,"Hello, and welcome to Citi's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Our earnings per share were 24% higher than 1 year ago as a result of strong business performance, a lower tax rate and a continued reduction in shares outstanding as we execute our capital return plans.
Global Consumer Banking had a good all-around quarter with 6% revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region.
While Fixed Income revenues were lower than a year ago, driven by less investor activity, our Equities business saw its best quarter in many years, giving us confidence that our investments are delivering results.
We also saw ongoing momentum in TTS, our Private Bank, Corporate Lending and Securities Services as we continued to grow these stable accrual-type businesses.
While Investment Banking revenue was down, we held on to the wallet share gains we've made in recent years, and client engagement remained strong.
Net income of $4.6 billion in the first quarter grew 13% from last year as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate.
Expenses increased 2% year-over-year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets.
GCB and ICG loans grew by $44 billion in total with contribution from every region in consumer as well as TTS to Private Bank and traditional Corporate Lending.
Excluding the impact of additional partnership terms that went into effect in January, we delivered roughly 2% underlying revenue growth in our U.S.-branded cards business this quarter, consistent with our full year 2018 outlook.
Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 2%, driven by higher average loans.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were up 2% as higher volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.
We continue to drive transaction volumes through lower-cost channels, and digital engagement remained strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users, including 25% growth among mobile users versus last year.
Net credit losses grew by 9% year-over-year, and we billed roughly $119 million of loan loss reserve this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning.
First quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew 8% with contribution from every business and region.
And card revenues grew 13% on continued growth in purchase sales and full-rate revolving loans as well as a favorable prior period comparison.
Revenues of $9.8 billion increased 6% from last year, driven by continued momentum in our accrual businesses [indiscernible] a very strong performance in Equities this quarter.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 8%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with solid growth across both net interest and fee income.
And Corporate Lending revenues of $521 million were up 19%, reflecting loan growth as well as lower hedging costs.
Total Markets & Securities Services revenues of $5 billion grew 3% from last year.
Corporate client activity remained strong, driving growth in G10 FX and local markets rates and currencies.
However, this was more than offset by lower investor client activity and a less favorable environment in G10 Rates and spread products, in particular in March.
Equities revenues were up 38% with growth across all products as volatility trended higher and we saw continued momentum with investor clients, in line with our investment strategy.
And our core accrual net interest margin improved by 8 basis points to 354 basis points, driven by the rate increase, loan growth and lower average cash balances as we use liquidity to fund higher-yielding assets.
Legacy asset-related net interest revenues should continue to decline by about $500 million this year as we wind down that portfolio.
Our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12.1% this quarter due to an increase in RWA, driven by loan growth and client activity as well as $3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, partially offset by net income.
In summary, we made good progress towards our longer-term goals this quarter with solid revenue growth, positive operating leverage and a significant improvement in net income and returns.
And then just conceptually, I mean, how much of the franchise, when we look at these Asian revenues, are kind of global corporates doing business versus maybe a notch below like more local companies?
And that gives us a fairly strong foundation in our rates and currency business because corporations need to fund their balance sheet every day, which means every day, you've got the ability to have a conversation with either a global treasurer or a local treasurer about what he or she needs to do in order to make payments, fund their working capital needs.
We told you that core accrual net interest revenue should grow $2.7 billion this quarter -- I mean, this year.
Our quarter showed strong and balanced performance as we continued to capture client-led growth, and we remain on track to deliver on the targets we announced at Investor Day. Relative to a year ago, we grew revenues by 3%, improved our efficiency ratio to just under 58%, increased our return on assets to 98 basis points and improved our return on tangible common equity to 11.4%.
We grew loans in our core businesses by 7% or $44 billion from last year, and we ended the quarter with over $1 trillion in deposits.
In branded cards, we saw the underlying revenue growth that we projected, driven by an increase in interest-earning balances and strong client engagement.
Revenues of $18.9 billion grew 3% from the prior year, reflecting 7% aggregate growth in our consumer and institutional businesses, offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other as we continued to wind down legacy assets.
In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 6% year-over-year to $673 billion as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
Total revenues of $8.4 billion grew 6% year-over-year and were up 4%, excluding the impact of the Hilton portfolio sale, which resulted in a gain this quarter, partially offset by the loss of operating revenues for a net benefit of about $120 million in our U.S.-branded cards business.
From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the first quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 8%, driven by continued growth in deposit margins, growth in investments and loans and increased commercial banking activity.
We continued to generate growth in total interest-earning balances this quarter, up about 6% year-over-year, excluding Hilton, as recent vintages continued to mature, as expected, partially offset by the runoff of non-core balances.
Retail banking revenues grew 7% in the first quarter, driven by growth in loans and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads.
In total, operating expenses grew 5% in the first quarter as investment spending and volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings, and cost of credit was essentially flat.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 10% from last year, generally in line with the overall market and reflecting the timing of episodic deal activity.
Private Bank revenues of $904 million grew 21% year-over-year, driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads.
As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.2 billion this quarter grew slightly from last year.
On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew slightly, reflecting the December rate hike as well as loan growth, partially offset by the impact of lower day count.
On a full year basis, we now expect core accrual net interest revenue to grow by over $2.7 billion in 2018 as we've added the impact of the recent March rate hike to our original outlook, which had called for $2.5 billion of growth, assuming only one fed rate increase in June.
And trading-related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we saw in the first quarter.
Looking to the second quarter for total Citigroup, we expect top line growth to continue broadly in line with the pace we set this quarter at around 3%, plus or minus, with stronger growth in our operating businesses being offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets.
In consumer, we expect continued revenue growth in U.S. retail banking, retail services, Mexico and Asia.
And we expect continued revenue growth in our accrual businesses, TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network.
Yes, the accounting changes impacted our overall efficiency by 50, 60 basis points, so I don't think that, that really changes our target of getting into the low 50s at all.
Now I'll give you the fact that when you take a look at the first quarter efficiency ratio of 57.9%, it certainly is above the 57% target that we got in place for the full year, but it's not inconsistent with our plan for the rest of the year.
And so when you look at the rest of the year, I think you have to expect continued top line momentum.
And finally, as I noted, I believe when I spoke at the RBC conference, we're taking the opportunity today to invest in the franchise to both to continue top line momentum as well as to capture significant efficiency savings that we've outlined for you at Investor Day. Now we're seeing much of the year-over-year impact of growth in these investments in the first half of 2018.
So think in terms of investment spending being a bit more front-end loaded in 2018 and the resulting efficiency benefits then begin to ramp up in the second half of the year.
So there's a structural element of the balance sheet, but I don't think that we want to get into putting on -- having an interest rate view of businesses that are trading interest rates.
It's actually a build-on of things that we saw building from the second half of last year, and I think it speaks to a lot of the growing economies in Asia, a little bit more positive outlook.
One of the biggest questions I get on you guys surrounds the card -- U.S. card business and how to think about or size the TCA rate impact and how it can maybe rebound eventually in terms of conversion rates and with the size of the portfolio.
I mean, we can maybe take an educated guess, but if there's any kind of help you can give us in trying to think through what -- how the portfolio is sized today and how much you think you'll end up with in terms of paying balances next year and beyond.
So we're never going to drive it to 0 because it certainly is an important piece of the growth strategy for the business, but it will get a little -- we acknowledge that it was a little outsized last year because we pulled back from trying to grow in the rewards product area and focused instead on the promo balances in value and whatnot.
And I thought the new data point, you said there's 6% growth in interest-earning balances, and I think that would compare to 4% growth in the fourth quarter.
Well, I think that, again, you're going to see, once we get past '18, we talked about some of the revenue impacts in '18 holding the overall business revenues flat.
If you look at that now, basically I think if you look year-over-year, even with that percentage declining, we're still getting growth in net interest revenue in U.S.-branded cards, ex Hilton, something north of 2%, 2.4%, 2.3%.
And so our guidance had been that for each quarter, we get an additional 25 basis point rate hike, it should add about $80 million worth of net interest revenue for the year.
And so -- and I think this quarter's performance at least provides a point of evidence for it, although we were building up market share all during last year as well.
It sounds from what I could glean that given the growth that you're contemplating or anticipating within core accrual NII as well as the declines or more subdued revenues on the trading NII side as well as the legacy runoff book, it feels like, for the full year, we should see NII relatively flat.
Yes, actually, we continue to see credit performing very, very well, whether it be in the North America businesses or in Mexico or in Asia when it comes to consumer.
And what John referenced before is what we laid out in the Investor Day around this $1.5 billion of efficiency we think we can get out of our consumer business.

CITI,q2,2018,"And welcome to CitiÂs Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that todayÂs presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on managementÂs current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
Investment banking revenue delivered another solid quarter with good growth in advisory and equity underwriting.
Branded Cards should face headwinds, but weÂre seeing underlying momentum that gives us confidence in growth going forward.
WeÂre focused on transforming the client experience across our franchise, driving digital solutions for both our consumer and institutional clients, while lowering our costs through automation or other service improvements.
So our capital planning has been effective, reducing our common shares outstanding by over 200 million over the past year to just over 2.5 billion shares, which helped drive our EPS up by 20%.
Branded Cards has grown 1%, we are seeing underlying improvements in 2018 that gives us confidence in a stronger trajectory going forward.
And while Mexico was somewhat below its 10% target, weÂve seen an improving growth trend over the past few quarters.
Fixed Income markets have been challenging, but weÂve offset this pressure with solid double-digit revenue growth in our accrual businesses TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services and weÂre also seeing significant growth in equities.
As Mike noted earlier, we recently announced plans to return an additional $22 billion in dividends and buybacks over the next 12 months.
Slide five shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
We launched the first set of foundational features in May on our mobile app, including the ability for retail banking clients to view and analyze their full financial position across firms.
Bean card portfolio, which added $1.5 billion of high quality receivables at quarter end.
On slide seven, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
Slide eight shows the global consumer credit trends in more detail.
Credit continued to be favorable again this quarter with NCL and delinquency rates broadly stable across regions.
Our CET1 capital ratio remain roughly flat sequentially at 12.1% this quarter, as net income was offset by $3.1 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, and our tangible book value per share increased slightly to $61.29.
Second, is how weÂre using technology to streamline our own operations, things like straight through application processing, the use of big data and branch optimization.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Curious if there are one or two products that youÂre most confident and thatÂs going to drive that pick up in the second half and 2019?
Hi. I think the second half revenue comps are hopefully relatively easy and its sounds like youÂre pretty confident on the expense side.
But it feels like there should be some bigger payback at some point beyond just 1% or 2% revenue growth.
Your next question is from line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.
Every second quarter there is dividend season in Europe.
So, can you walk us through just how U.S. rate curves versus non-U.S. rate curves are affecting how youÂre looking at deposit growth and what youÂre paying in different markets and itÂs just a type of improvement that we should start seeing in terms of incremental betas from here?
John, can you share with us -- youÂre ruling up the national digital platform as you described.
WeÂre seeing really nice growth in our mobile NPS right now.
Are there any other in the pipeline types of bidding that youÂre doing where we could hear further announcements, second half of this year or early next year on Branded or on wins like this?
In this case L.L. I just didnÂt notice in Asia there was -- looked like you had an uptick in corporate and non-performers, again itÂs not a major issue.
Hi. Just -- wanted to just ask one question, I want to make sure I heard what Mike was saying earlier.
As we think about 2019, the ROA in North American Branded Cards should continue to -- should be improving from here regardless of any new partnerships that you may win?
Hi. YouÂve been discussing your international consumer strategy mainly in terms of online and mobile banking and so on.
In the U.S., we continued to grow our retail banking business and we closed the acquisition of the L.L. Bean portfolio in retail services and in U.S. Branded Cards, we saw strong interest earning balance growth as our investments continue to mature.
While Fixed Income was in line with what we forecasted, our equities business had another strong quarter, up 19% from the year before and our accrual businesses continued to show strong growth across the board, especially Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services, Corporate Lending, and the Private Bank.
Taking a step back for a moment, was almost a year ago since we brought you all together to lay out our 2020 targets, so I think this morning is a good opportunity to recap some of the progress weÂve made since Investor Day. As you may recall, at the time, I spoke about three strategic priorities we would pursue to reach those financial targets.
In consumer, our Wealth Management capabilities have been enhanced both through branch-based and digital outreach, and we significantly increased the amount of Citigold households here in the U.S. Internationally, Mexico is starting to see the revenue levels weÂve forecasted, as we execute our investment plan there and our Asia franchise continues to grow.
Clearly, U.S. On the second priority, weÂve continued to drive our digital transformation and invest for growth, while self funding these investments through efficiency savings.
And overall, weÂve improved our operating efficiency year-over-year for seven straight quarters and weÂre on track to reach the low 50s by 2020.
Revenues of $18.5 billion grew 2% from the prior year, driven by higher net interest revenues and expenses were flat, as higher volume-related expenses and investments were fully offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets.
Now looking at the first half of 2018, we generated modest revenue growth and positive operating leverage, with roughly 90 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio.
In North America, our retail banking and retail services businesses are broadly on pace and while U.S. In Asia, we outperformed our 4% medium-term growth target, driven by strength in Wealth Management revenues.
WeÂve ramped up investments across the franchise to support this client led growth, but over the past year, weÂve been able to fully offset this additional spend and volume driven growth through efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, resulting in flat expenses in total.
Net income grew 15% in the second quarter, driven by operating margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by a higher cost of credit.
Global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the second quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs, even as we continue to shrink our physical branch footprint.
However, this gain was partially offset in the second quarter by the impact of repricing actions on a small portion of our card accounts related to the previously disclosed issues with APR rate re-evaluation under the CARD Act. For the full year, we expect the impact of these repricing actions to be roughly $50 million.
In total, we continue to expect branded card revenues excluding Hilton to be roughly flat this year on a reported basis, with around 2% underlying growth, driven by continued strong client engagement, loan growth and improved mix.
Excluding Hilton, purchase sales grew 10% year-over-year in the quarter and average loans grew 5%, including 6% growth in interest-earning balances as recent vintages continue to mature.
This growth rate is likely to accelerate over the next few quarters, reflecting the recent acquisition of the L.L. Excluding the impact of this provision, expenses were up 1% as higher volume-related expenses and investments were largely offset by efficiency savings.
Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by 8% year-over-year and we billed roughly $117 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning.
Retail banking revenues grew 12% in the second quarter, driven by growth in loans and deposits.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 2% year-over-year in the second quarter and were up 4% excluding the benefit of a modest one-time gain in the prior year.
Retail banking revenues grew 4%, reflecting continued strength in Wealth Management, despite a sequential slowdown in investment revenues and excluding the one-time gain last year, card revenues also grew 4% on continued growth in loans and purchase sales.
In total, operating expenses were up 4% in the second quarter, as investment spending and volumes driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Revenues of $9.7 billion increased 3% from last year, driven by continued momentum in our accrual businesses, along with a strong performance in equity this quarter.
Total Banking revenues of $5.2 billion grew 6%, Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 11%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with solid growth across both net interest and fee income.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were down 7% from last year, as growth in M&A and equity underwriting was more than offset by a very strong prior-year comparison in debt underwriting.
Private Bank revenues of $848 million grew 7% year-over-year driven by growth in clients, loans and investments, as well as improved deposit spreads.
Equities revenues were up 19%, with growth across all products, reflecting the benefit of continued higher market volatility, as well as continued momentum with investor clients in line with our investment strategy.
Total operating expenses of $5.5 billion increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher compensation costs and an increase in business volumes, along with higher levels of investments spending, partially offset by productivity savings.
As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.7 billion this quarter grew roughly 12% from last year, as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading related net interest revenue, as well as the wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew approximately $550 million, reflecting the benefit of higher rates, as well as loan growth, along with the impact of one additional day in the quarter and our core accrual net interest margin also improved by 6 basis points, primarily reflecting higher rates.
Looking ahead for the remainder of the year, we are updating our prior outlook for growth in core accrual net interest revenue from roughly $2.7 billion to $3.4 billion for full year 2018, reflecting loan growth, improved mix and lower than expected retail deposits sensitivity in the first half of the year, as well as an additional rate hike in September that had not been included in our original outlook.
Although, the retail deposit betas have run lower than anticipated so far this year, we do expect higher sensitivity going forward, which is reflected in our outlook.
Finally, we continue to expect legacy asset related net interest revenues to decline by about $500 million this year as we wind down that portfolio.
And trading related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we saw in the first and second quarters.
In Consumer, in North America we should see continued progress in retail banking and retail services, including a full quarter contribution from L.L. Branded Cards growth will continue to be impacted by the Hilton sale on a year-over-year basis.
However, we do expect the net interest revenue percentage to improve sequentially beginning this quarter as our loan mix continues to improve.
Expenses should continue to decline sequentially in both the third and fourth quarters, and this should keep us on pace to again deliver roughly 100 basis points of efficiency improvement similar to what we achieved in the first half of the year.
Second, are the incremental investments weÂre making to both deepen our client relationships and improve the efficiency of our operations.
If we look at what weÂve achieved so far over the past year, weÂve deployed nearly half of the $1.5 billion of incremental investments, with a somewhat heavier emphasis in consumer initially and now across both consumer and ICG, and at the same time, weÂve only realized roughly a third of the estimated $2.5 billion of efficiency savings.
If you do the math, youÂll see that the incremental investments were funded through efficiency savings over the past year, while other volume driven expenses were essentially offset through the wind down of legacy assets.
So weÂre not yet at a point where the efficiency savings are outpacing the incremental investment spend but that should change as we go forward.
The lower hedging costs, thatÂs something weÂve actually talked about, I think, for the last several quarters, that itÂs a combination of two things, Glenn.
Thanks for the comments about the trajectory of your investment spend versus the cost saves that was helpful to thinking about your path of efficiency improvement.
I just want to reiterate based on the targets and the pickup and saves youÂre expecting, this year youÂre kind of running at a pace for about 100 basis point efficiency improvement, and it sounds like thatÂs going to accelerate next year to kind of a 200 basis point improvement pace starting next year I guess.
So, I donÂt want you to think that 11% is going to be every quarter, but again over the next two and half years [inaudible] at or close to that 10% CAGR that we put out at Investor Day. Thank you.
Hi, Jim. Maybe just a follow up on sort of the growth in outside the U.S. ItÂs obviously been ticking up, but I think investors are pretty concerned about what weÂve seen lately in terms of emerging market or at least equity markets and tariffs and NAFTA.
But how do we think about where those incremental investments could go, would it be more to accelerate efficiency saves, potentially, letÂs say, in the Institutional side or would it be more for revenue growth drive -- driven those investments or a combination of both?
But I think we would look at a combination of both revenue growth investments and continued efficiency.
So weÂre in there, so as John said, when we get into budget weÂre going to be looking at opportunities that we have in the firm of where we can make investments and get some strong near-term savings and paybacks, and thatÂs why at this point, we really donÂt want to commit to exactly how the 400 breaks between Â19 and Â20, because we may have some things that we can pull forward that are actually cost us a little bit in Â19, but have the ability to pay back in Â20.
",51.52,0.57666063
CITI,q3,2018,"We continue to see solid growth this quarter in many areas, including our accrual businesses and ICG, fixed income, and Mexico Consumer and despite a drag from net one-time gains that affected our top line comparisons, we still achieve positive operating leverage for the quarter, driving our efficiency ratio down to 56.1%.
We're on track to achieve our 2018 financial target, on a year-to-date basis we've generated 4% underlying growth in aggregate across our consumer and institutional businesses.
And in the U.S., we're starting to see the impact of the L.L. Branded Cards had sequential revenue growth and given strong growth in interest earning balances, we remain on course to achieve 2% underlying revenue growth for the year.
Fixed Income and equities were up 7% in total and as in the past our accrual businesses, TTS Security Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank all showed strong year-over-year growth.
Revenues of $18.4 billion were roughly flat to the prior year, reflecting the net impact of one-time gain in the third quarters of both 2017 and 2018, as well as FX translation.
In constant dollars, total revenues excluding these gains grew by 4% in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in our institutional franchise.
Looking at year-to-date results on slide four, you can see aggregate revenues in our consumer and institutional businesses have grown 4% this year, excluding the previously mentioned gains.
On an underlying basis, institutional revenues have grown 4% in line with our medium term expectations, driven by our accrual businesses in treasury and trade solutions, securities services, lending and the private bank and consumer revenues have grown 3% in constant dollars, somewhat below our medium term goal.
Now this is primarily driven by the near-term impact of weaker market sentiment on our Asia Wealth Management revenues, the impact of partnership terms that came into effect earlier this year in U.S. branded cards, which we will lap as we go into 2019.
Net income grew 36% in the third quarter, largely driven by lower cost of credit, a lower effective tax rate and the gain on the sale of Mexico Asset Management business.
Total revenues of $8.7 billion, grew 3% year-over-year, reflecting the strength in Latin America as well as the one-time gain, and expenses increased by 6% year-over-year, driven by the timing of investment initiatives versus the prior year.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 1% in the third quarter, a slower pace than we saw in the first half of the year largely reflecting lower episodic transaction activity in commercial banking, as well as increasing rate sensitivity.
Turning to Branded Cards, revenues were down 3% from last year, including the impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio, as well as previously mentioned partnership terms that went into effect earlier this year.
Now excluding Hilton, purchase sales grew 11% year-over-year in the quarter and average loans grew 4%, including 7% growth in interest-earning balances as recent vintages continued to mature.
For the full year, we continue to expect reported revenues in Branded Cards to be roughly flat; however we remain on track to achieve 2% underlying growth.
Finally, retail services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 2%, driven by organic loan growth, as well as the full quarter benefit of the recent acquisition of the L.L. On a sequential basis, expenses were roughly flat and should remain stable into the fourth quarter.
Third quarter revenues of $3.5 billion grew 11%, driven by strength in Latin America, as well as the previously mentioned one-time gain.
In Latin America, excluding the gain, total consumer revenues grew 8%, driven by continued volume growth across commercial, mortgage and card loans, as well as deposits.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the third quarter, as continued growth in deposit, lending and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues, given a weaker market sentiment.
Over the last 12 months, Asia Consumer revenues grew 4%, in line with our medium term expectations, driven by 5% growth in revenues excluding investment products.
And we are continuing to increase the proportion of more stable accrual type investment revenues, as our business in Asia today is more sensitive to upfront transaction fees than in other regions.
And constant credit grew 17%, reflecting loan growth as well as the impact of a reserve release in Asia in the prior year period.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide nine, excluding the impact of a prior year gain, revenues of $9.2 billion increased 4% in the third quarter and were also up 4% on a year-to-date basis, with strength in both banking and markets.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 8% from last year as growth in M&A was more than offset by a decline in underwriting fees, reflecting lower market activity.
Private Bank revenues of $849 million grew 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in loans and investments as well as improved deposit spreads.
As you can see total net interest revenue were $11.8 billion this quarter, grew roughly 5% from last year, as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew approximately $270 million, reflecting the benefit of higher rates as well as loan growth along with the impact of one additional day in the quarter.
Year-to-date core accrual revenue grew by over $2.7 billion year-over-year and we expect to see additional growth in the fourth quarter that's roughly in line with the $970 million we saw this quarter.
However, as a reminder, on a full year basis, we expect this increase to be partially offset by a roughly $500 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy asset wind down portfolio in corporate/other.
And trading related net interest revenue will likely to continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we've seen year-to-date.
And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our accrual businesses, including Treasury and Trade Solutions, Securities Services, Lending and the Private Bank.
In U.S. Branded Cards, total revenues will continue to reflect the impact of the Hilton sale as well as partnership terms that went into effect earlier this year.
And we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in Asia and Mexico.
We've been talking about certainly during the first nine months of this year, which is that we continue to expect revenue growth largely in line with GDP and call that that 4% or so revenue growth in our core businesses, say 3% overall.
And one more quick follow-up in terms of the card revenues starting to look better next year seems like the core revenue growth rate feels like 2% this year and will accelerate next year on a core basis.
So, as we look forward, we expect those interest earning balances to continue to grow and then a larger percentage of that growth gradually comes from the higher margin proprietary product balances.
But if you take a look at it how it's performed over the past two years, the overall franchise has been growing at about 4% right in line with where we've targeted out to 2020.
I think you're going to see improved growth on that line when we get into next year, and we get beyond some of these one-off transactions.
And welcome to CitiÂs Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach.
Investment banking was down versus last year as continued growth in M&A was more than offset by slower underwriting activity across the industry.
His experience in Asia where we operate a client centric franchise with strong digital adoption will help us bring North America to where it needs to be as we look to leverage both our brand and our scale in credit cards to drive deeper client relationships nationwide.
Despite the revenue headwind from net one-time gains, we achieved positive operating leverage this quarter with our efficiency ratio improving year-over-year to 56.1%.
Constant credit was down slightly versus last year as lower reserve builds in consumer were largely offset by volume growth and the normalization of credit costs in ICG.
GCB and ICG loans grew by 6% or $37 billion in total with contribution from every region in consumer, as well as TTS the private bank and traditional corporate lending.
Total expenses for North America consumer were up 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of investments versus the prior period.
The sequential increase in the NCL rate in Latin America reflected an episodic promotional charge-off that was fully offset by a related loan loss reserve release and therefore neutral to cost of credit.
And Corporate Lending revenues of $563 million were up 11%, reflecting loan growth along with lower hedging cost.
Total operating expenses of $5.2 billion increased 1% year-over-year, as higher compensation costs, investments and an increase in business volumes were partially offset by efficiency savings.
And pre-tax income was $65 million this quarter, better than our outlook reflecting higher treasury revenues and lower infrastructure expenses relative to our prior expectations.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a modest pre-tax loss in Corp/Other, mostly driven by seasonally higher franchise wide marketing and regulatory consulting cost, relative to the third quarter.
However core accrual net interest margin remain flat on a sequential basis, as the benefits of higher rates and loan growth were offset by higher average cash balances during the quarter.
In the third quarter our CET-1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 11.8% as net income was more than offset by share buybacks and dividends and we saw an increase in risk weighted assets related to client activity.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.
And just maybe just one other, maybe forgive me if I missed your comment on fix rating, but you guys obviously at least so far what weÂve seen outperformed I think our expectations.
And maybe a flip side question on Asia, good explanation on market sensitive stuff laying down decent underlying growth, but in the 4% 2020 target thatÂs a full package, right?
We saw pretty good underlying growth everything other than the wealth management.
Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
So will you be getting additional disclosure as relates to North America consumer whether itÂs digital banking or a slice indicing a few different ways for us externally?
Mike when you say additional disclosure you mean other than the break outs that we give you right now as far as Branded Cards, retail services and retail bank and then adding them all up together to be the North America region.
Or it could relate to more digital banking disclosure, how youÂre doing with products and customers or you had a lot more capability internally, given what you have done with project Rainbow and I thought that was a good reference like a decade or two to consolidate all the retail system and after all there is earlier acquisitions.
Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
And then separately, could you just walk us through how you're thinking about planning for the potential risk of the Sears [ph] bankruptcy either filing Chapter 7, Chapter 11 not sure which way itÂs going to go right now, but seemingly likely to come on Monday.
Mike, I think in your opening comments you mentioned that you felt pretty good about the investment banking pipeline and upcoming transactions.
Your final question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.

CITI,q4,2018,"And despite the market conditions we experienced throughout the fourth quarter, we still improved our operating efficiency to 57% for the year.
In addition, we grew loans and deposits in constant dollars by 4% and 7% respectively, improved our return on assets to 93 basis points and managed our effective tax rate down to the 23% range, a little better than we had forecast.
Our expense base declined by 4% both year-over-year and sequentially this quarter, taking our annual expense base to below $42 billion, and we continued to prudently manage risk-weighted assets to optimize our capital needs.
Our accrual businesses, which consist of Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services, the Private Bank, and Corporate Lending continued their very strong performance, up 11% for the full year in constant dollars.
In Global Consumer Banking, in the US, we saw 4% underlying growth in Branded Cards and 6% revenue growth in Retail Services this quarter, and Retail Banking grew 5% ex-mortgages.
Internationally, we saw good growth in Mexico, especially in the cards products, while Asia was impacted by lower revenues from investment products.
As I mentioned before, we have levers we can pull if revenues come in lower, but we're very cognizant of the need to invest for the long-term so that we can serve our clients with distinction.
Now, looking at our results on this basis, net income of $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter grew 14% from last year driven by a reduction in expenses, lower cost of credit, and a lower effective tax rate, and EPS grew 26% including the impact of an 8% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.
Revenues of $17.1 billion declined 2% from the prior year, primarily reflecting a lower Fixed Income Markets revenues as well as the wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.
Institutional revenues also grew 3%, as strength in our accrual businesses in Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank was partially offset by weakness in Fixed Income, as well as softness in equity and debt underwriting.
Excluding mortgage, Retail Banking revenues grew 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, slightly better growth than we saw in the third quarter, and deposit spreads stabilized in our commercial portfolio, and we faced fewer headwinds from episodic transaction activity.
Turning to Branded Cards, revenues were roughly flat versus the prior year, including the impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio as well as partnership terms that went into effect in 2018.
Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 6%, driven by organic loan growth, as well as the benefit of the acquisition of the L.L.Bean card portfolio.
In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 5% or 7% excluding the ongoing impact of the sale of our asset management business in the third quarter.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of a modest gain on the sale of a merchant acquiring business in the prior year.
Excluding the gain, card revenues grew 3% year-over-year on continued growth in loans and purchase sales.
And excluding investment revenues, our underlying Asia Consumer growth remained broadly in line with our medium-term expectations driven by growth in loans and deposits.
In total, operating expenses were up 1% in the fourth quarter, as investment spending and volume driven growth was largely offset by efficiency savings.
Turning now the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8, revenues of $8.2 billion were down 1% in the fourth quarter as strength in our accrual businesses as well as revenue growth in M&A and Equity Markets were more than offset by weakness in Fixed Income.
Total banking revenues of $5 billion grew 5%, Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 7% as reported and 11% in constant dollars, reflecting continued growth in transaction volumes and deposits as well as improved spreads.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.3 billion were down 1% from last year, as strong M&A performance was more than offset by a decline in underwriting, reflecting lower market activity.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.1 billion declined 11% in the fourth quarter.
Fixed Income revenues of $1.9 billion declined 21% year-over-year due to a challenging trading environment during the quarter.
Looking at the full year, excluding the previously mentioned gain of roughly $580 million in 2017, both revenues and expenses grew by 3% in 2018.
The combined strong performance in these businesses helped to offset weakness in Investment Banking and Fixed Income, down 7% and 6% respectively on a full year basis.
And pre-tax income was $44 million this quarter, better than our outlook, reflecting episodic gains in our investment portfolio as well as lower total expenses relative to our prior expectations.
As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.9 billion this quarter grew roughly 8% from last year in constant dollars as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue as well as the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.
On a full year basis, core accrual revenue grew by more than $4 billion over 2017, ahead of our outlook of $3.7 billion for the year with about $1 billion coming from the benefit of higher interest rates.
So, on a net basis, we expect to generate as much or even more than the $2 billion of growth in net interest revenue that we saw in 2018, even if we see less incremental benefit from rate hikes.
Of course, in 2018, this growth in net interest revenue was partially offset by a roughly $1 billion decline in non-interest revenues, driven by a drag from partnership renewal terms and lower mortgage revenues in Consumer, the wind-down of legacy assets, the impact of gains we took in 2017 on hedging activity in Corporate Treasury and the net impact of previously mentioned one-time gains on asset sales.
In the fourth quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 6% year-over-year to $63.79 driven by the lower share count and our CET1 Capital ratio improved to 11.9% driven by a reduction in risk-weighted assets, as we continued to prudently manage the balance sheet.
We also recognize that weÂre in an uncertain macro environment where the market is beginning to discount future growth and this may create a more volatile operating environment as we saw in the fourth quarter.
And while are US Branded Cards franchise generated only 1% growth for the full year, we saw 3% underlying growth in that franchise in 2018 with momentum as we exited the fourth quarter.
ThatÂs a business with nearly $9 billion of annual revenues, where we are now realizing the benefits of our investments over the past three years.
Of course, itÂs more difficult to predict the operating environment in areas like trading and investment banking but we continued to show good progress in M&A and equities this year, and our global FX business proved to be resilient in a challenging market.
As we look to 2019, weÂre preparing for a range of operating environments with a focus on achieving our RoTCE target of 12% this year in a responsible sustainable way.
From a revenue perspective, in addition to the good momentum weÂre seeing in many of our businesses, we also have other revenue tailwinds, including the absence of the FDIC surcharge, as well as a smaller expected drag from the wind-down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.
I think that's a big sort of concern in the marketplace given the revenue backdrop at least in the fourth quarter that can change quickly in capital markets and I appreciate the commitment to the RoTCE.
But more importantly to your question around expense ranges we can manage to, you can look at the fourth quarter of 2018 and see we ran at about 41.8.
I mean if you -- the Branded Cards as John mentioned, fourth quarter roughly 3% underlying, and that's a -- we think of that as a pretty good run rate going into 2019.
And I think the -- what's clearly in the fourth quarter overshadowed that was really market fears over what the transition from QE to QT might look and feel like.
So if you go back and you look at the last page or so that John talked about, when you look at underlying growth in the business, if you look at -- John talked about the $9 billion of TTS revenue growing at 11%, we talked about Securities Services, the Private Bank lending, Mexico, US Branded Cards, equities, M&A, if you just take those revenues and add them up, you're in excess of 50% of the revenue of the firm.
And so again, when you think about things that are top of list, clearly, the more broad investment in terms of digital, we talked about some of those cost saves that have begun to come through roughly the $200 million this year, manifesting itself in $500 million to $600 million incremental in each of the next two years, a lot of that savings is dependent upon the continued investment in terms of the switch from analog to digital, and in particular in parts of our consumer business, coming from behind and kind of getting cards back on track, the empty calories of cutting marketing investment in terms of our platforms there, the investments that weÂve started and have been executing against in terms of Mexico.
But, in the environment as we sit, we're going to do the appropriate things of making sure that we continue to push ourselves on the expense front, at the same time knowing that we've got to create our own capacity to invest.
And again, as we grow -- as we saw the fourth quarter come down in revenues, we were able to bring our risk-weighted assets down as well.
But, we do have to keep in mind that our reported growth for noninterest revenue will look a little bit lower than the underlying because of a number of one-timers including the wind down of legacy assets and things like the Hilton gain and the Visa B share gains et cetera.
So, I think the way you can think about it is that the bulk of the reported growth that we'd expect to see next year would come in the NII line, but we would not see the decline in noninterest revenue and perhaps even see some upside there.
And that was one of the things that led us then to talk about trading revenues overall being down slightly year-over-year because we didn't see that good engagement in G10 rates.
And I think, look, Marty, what you saw in particular in the later stages of the fourth quarter and you could see it manifest when you look at fund returns for the quarter, where people went from in some cases having pretty reasonable years to actually having down years, we really saw kind of a mindset that manifested itself in similar ways for those people that managed to get there and be up.
I just think about the net interest rate, the net interest revenue outlook that we just talked about, and all of the growth now that is coming out of those businesses, youÂve seen the core accrual revenue grow $4 billion year-over-year.
I think, when we put together the targets, it reflected where we thought weÂd see the opportunity, so continued momentum out of Mexico, momentum out of Asia albeit, as John has described, weÂre seeing some pressure in the retail banking part of the business, particularly invest in investments.
But at this point in time, IÂd say that mix that weÂve talked about then in terms of needing to close the gap on the consumer side and 100 basis points or so of improvement on the ICG side is still where we think things are heading.
I guess the final point IÂd make on that as is as you saw in the fourth quarter, where we see pressure in the business I saw pressure in fixed income in particular, you'll see us manage the balance sheet.
But since you missed revenue growth this year, youÂre really kind of looking at now in the 4% [ph] in the next two years to still stay at a 3% for the full time period.
So, when you look at that, as we've described that at Investor Day, Brian, we talked about a number of levers, right, that it was the combination of single-digit revenue growth, good expense discipline, reasonable cost to credit, and obviously significant capital return.
So, I mean, look, in the past, in 2017, we talked about roughly $100 million benefit per quarter for 25 basis-point Fed rate hike.
I think if you take a look at it on a full-year basis, thatÂs a much better gauge of what you're doing in a business because you're going to have quarters like this where you have a slight decline in the retail revenues.
Today, we are joining by CitiÂs Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; the Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach; and CitiÂs incoming CFO, Mark Mason.
Hey. Our effective tax rate was 21% for the quarter, reflecting an adjustment to our full year estimate of income taxes under the new tax regime as well as other resulting actions we have taken.
Now, looking at full year results on Slide 4, we made steady progress in 2018, although revenue growth remained somewhat below our medium-term outlook.
This is primarily driven by the near-term impact of weaker market sentiment on our Asia wealth management revenues; the impact of partnership terms that came into effect in 2018 in US Branded Cards, which we have now lapped as we go into 2019; and finally, in US Retail, a drag from lower US Mortgage revenues which should abate going forward as well as rising deposit sensitivity.
These results largely reflect the macro uncertainty seen in the fourth quarter, which created a challenging trading environment as well as an industry-wide slowdown in underwriting activity.
If you look at 2018 versus 2017, we more than doubled our net new money inflows across consumer deposits and investments this year.
Average loans grew 3% versus last year, including 9% growth in interest earning balances as recent vintages continued to mature and we saw strong balance retention across our portfolio.
As such, we expect to remain broadly around this level of spreads going forward, although we will see quarterly fluctuations and actual performance will depend on a number of factors, including our acquisition mix, the rate environment and our balance between proprietary and co-brand portfolios over time.
As weÂve now lapped the impact of partnership renewals on our fee income and weÂre growing loan volumes at more attractive spreads.
Card revenues grew 8% on continued strength in purchase sales and loan growth, while retail banking revenues grew 6% excluding the impact of the asset management sale.
While investment revenues remained under pressure, we continued to see positive inflows into assets under management as well as 8% growth in Citigold Client.
Total average loan growth of 3% in Asia includes the impact of our continued repositioning away from lower return mortgage assets.
Private Bank revenues of $797 million grew 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in loans and investments as well as improved deposit spreads and Corporate Lending revenues of $559 million were up 9%, reflecting loan growth along with lower hedging costs.
At the Goldman Conference in early December, I noted that while clients remained engaged, we did not see the level of transaction activity we had originally expected this quarter in G10 rates in particular, as clients had largely stayed on the sidelines in an uncertain macro environment.
Securities Services grew 11%, as we continued to deepen client relationships while also benefiting from the higher rate environment.
And in Fixed Income, if you look at our total G10 FX and local markets rates and currencies business, revenues were far more stable at roughly flat to last year as we benefited from steady corporate flow activity across our global network.
Core accrual net interest revenue grew by $1.4 billion year-over-year, well above our prior expectations driven by the FDIC surcharge benefit, improved spreads in our US Branded Cards business and balance sheet optimization as we deployed more cash into better yielding assets.
The remaining 8 basis points reflect momentum weÂve seen building over the second half of the year, given higher interest rates, continued loan growth and an improved loan mix.
As we noted last quarter, even though core accrual net interest revenues grew sequentially from the second to the third quarter of 2018, our net interest margin remained flat at 360 basis points as the benefits of higher rates and loan growth were offset by higher average cash balances during the quarter.
We maintained our credit discipline growing our loan portfolio, while maintaining loss rates that were well within our medium-term expectations across every business and region.
Our other accrual businesses in ICG across Securities Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank generated another $8 billion of revenues with good line of sight into 2019.
Our Mexico Consumer franchise with nearly $6 billion of revenues continued to grow with a favorable market backdrop, including record low unemployment and strong consumer confidence.
John you mentioned feeling good about the momentum continuing on the NII front which was very solid this quarter and better fees as your lap the partnership headwind.
Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
What IÂd say is we see is we actually see a -- certainly US and even more broad global economy where the underlying fundamentals in particular on a domestic economy basis if you go around the world comprise of strong tight labor markets, reasonable wage increases, good consumption, while investment coming down, still reasonable.
And beyond that upfront impact and acceleration of store closures would likely have an impact on the Retail Services revenues, perhaps resulting to a flat top-line result in total for '19 and '20 given the expected impact of new account acquisitions.
Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
IÂd say that in -- especially in the second half of this year, weÂve seen flows -- overall flows in our consumer retail deposits -- excluding commercial deposits that pretty much have normalized now.
With December, we saw basically that extreme volatility given the overall lack of a view of where rates would finally bottom out just impact every one of our businesses in fixed income.
So, yes, equities were down a little bit more than debt, but you're still talking about some pretty significant drop-offs in market wallets, fourth quarter Â18 compared to fourth quarter 2017.
Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Hi. John, I can't believe we can't ask you questions on the call next quarter.
Yes. I know weÂve talked through a lot of high yield spread credit widening and how that's not really impacting you much.
Well, the deposit betas are likely -- certainly on the retail side, they're likely to continue to increase into Â19 even if there are no further rate hikes.
Most investors -- just a quick follow-up question are investing -- are expecting that the Fed will not raise rates anymore in 2019.
But if I look at, John, full-year Â18 ex the gain on the sale of asset management business, is it essentially revenue growth and expense growth or -- given your rounded numbers in constant dollars are essentially the same, so that would say no positive offering leverage?
",44.51,0.5492508
CITI,q1,2019,"We grow our operating margin by 8% and credit costs remain broadly in line with our expectations driving double digit EBIT growth.
We saw deposit growth in retail banking and introduced new products to support our branch light digital heavy strategy in the U.S. Our institutional clients group also performed well.
We also had a 20% increase in investment banking where we have steadily been gaining share among our target clients.
Fixed income did rebound from the fourth quarter with modest year-over-year growth while equities was impacted by a weaker environment.
As you know, we pride ourselves on having a deep bench, and last week we called on that depth when we selected new leadership who helped drive our firm forward in light of Jamie Forese's retirement.
Turning now to each business, Slide 4 shows the results for Global Consumer banking in constant dollars.
Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 2% driven by modest deposit growth and spread expansion.
We also launched a new digital lending product, Flex loan that allows eligible cardholders to convert a portion of their credit line into a fixed rate personal loan, leveraging our experience in Asia.
This will also initially be targeted to eligible card customers outside our core retail markets.
Retail loan growth was muted in Mexico again this quarter, driven by a slowdown in activity in our commercial banking franchise, where client sentiment has become more cautious under the new administration.
Excluding investment revenues, our underlying Asia consumer growth remains broadly in line with our medium term expectations.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 6% as reported, and 10% in constant dollars reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit and trade spreads.
Fixed income revenues of $3.5 billion grew 1% year-over-year as strengthened rates and spread products was partially offset by weakness in FX given the low currency volatility seen this quarter while corporate client activity remained stable.
Equities revenues were down 24% versus a particularly strong quarter in the prior year reflecting lower market volumes and client financing balances.
Total non-accrual loans increased sequentially this quarter, but the ratio of non-accrual to total corporate loans remained low at 41 basis points.
And the addition to non-accrual this quarter did not negatively impact our cost of credit as these loans were covered by previously established reserves.
And our NIM expanded by 1 basis point reflecting higher rates and improved loan mix.
And our CET1 capital ratio was stable sequentially at 11.9%, as net income was offset by $5.1 billion of total common share buybacks and dividends.
We face fewer headwinds in areas like Asia consumer, equities and the private bank, which presented difficult comparisons for us this quarter.
Yes. Branded Cards ex Hilton grew 5%.
Maybe just, Mark, quick question on rate sensitivity.
Maybe just one follow-up on Asia consumer accounts both card and retail banking accounts have been -- were pretty flat.
Yes. IÂll make two points on Asia consumer.
Yes. IÂm not giving any additional guidance at this point in time beyond whatÂs out there.
Yes. ThereÂs some revenue difference.
Thanks for taking my questions, Mark.
Yes. Mark Mason
Yes. Our G10 rate outperformed, driven really by strong client activity in North America.
We had positive operating leverage and improved our efficiency for the tenth straight quarter and we had strong growth in both loans and deposits in our core businesses.
In our global consumer bank, we had underlying revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region, excluding the Hilton gain last year, total revenues grew 4% on flat expenses.
In Mexico, we had 5% underlying growth, and while Asia grew at a slower rate due to a very strong prior year, investment revenues, loan and deposit growth remain solid.
Starting on Slide 3, net income of $4.7 billion in the first quarter grew 2% from last year, as a reduction in expenses, and a lower tax rate more than offset lower revenues as well as higher credit costs.
Revenues of $18.6 billion declined 2% from the prior year and were down 1% excluding $150 million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio last year, primarily reflecting lower equity markets revenues, and mark-to-market losses on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio, along with the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.
Expenses declined by 3% year-over-year as continued investments in the franchise were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, resulting in our 10th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage, and cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning while overall credit quality remained stable.
Excluding the previously mentioned gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses remained flat; resulting in positive operating leverage and an 8% improvement in operating margin, and pre-tax earnings grew 11%.
This growth and interest earning balances drove an improvement in our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans for NIR percent to 912 basis points this quarter.
Since that time, we have optimized our mix of interest earning, to non-interest earning balances, while continuing to drive account growth, and we expect loan growth to revert to more recent levels starting in the second quarter.
Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 3% driven by organic loan growth, as well as the impact of the L.L. We continue to drive transaction volumes for lower cost channels, and digital engagement remains strong with 12% growth in mobile users year-over-year.
In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 6% or 5% on an underlying basis excluding the impact of the sale of our asset management business last year.
Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the first quarter as growth in deposit, lending and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues.
While investment revenues remained under pressure in the first quarter, we continued to see positive flow into assets under management, as well as 10% year-over-year growth in Citigold clients.
In total, operating expenses were down 1% for the first quarter as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume driven growth.
Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8, revenues of $9.7 billion declined 2% in the first quarter, as strengthened TTS and investment banking was more than offset by weakness in equities, as well as the impact of $230 million of mark-to-market losses on loan hedges as credit spreads tightened throughout the quarter.
Private Bank revenues of $880 million declined 3% versus a strong quarter in the prior year reflecting lower managed investment revenues as well as higher funding cost, and corporate lending revenues of $569 million were up 9% reflecting growth in volumes and spreads.
Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion decline 1% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investments and volume driven growth, and cost of credit was $21 million this quarter driven by portfolio growth, partially offset by loan specific reserve releases.
In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.8 billion this quarter grew by roughly $860 million year-over-year, reflecting higher rates, loan growth and a favorable loan mix as well as the absence of the FDIC surcharge.
On a full year basis, we continue to expect to generate at least $2 billion of growth and net interest revenue year-over-year.
For the full year, we continue to expect modest revenue growth, flattish expenses, and higher but manageable cost of credit, combined with continued balance sheet and capital optimization to drive improved returns for our shareholders.
Looking to the second quarter, we expect to return to year-over-year revenue growth.
And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our core businesses, across TTS, security services, corporate lending and the private bank as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network.
And in Mexico, year-over-year revenue growth will likely be muted given strong growth and performance in the second quarter of last year, although we expect continued growth in pre-tax earnings.
For the full year as I mentioned, we are looking for some top line revenue growth for total Citi and expenses that would be roughly flattish to what we'd seen in the prior year.
That will obviously result in improved operating efficiency versus last year, but probably equally important, certainly equally important, we are managing those other levers whether it be the cost of credit or capital to ensure that weÂre getting to that RoTCE of 12%, and that would stay on our trajectory to get to 13.5 plus in the outer years.
What's involved with that to the other part of your question is continued momentum, continued growth in the accrual businesses that we have that I mentioned earlier, TTS Security Services, Private Bank et cetera, continued strength in our consumer franchise which grew globally at 4% this year, but U.S. We expect that growth to continue, and continue strengthening NIR line percentage for the Branded Cards business.
On the expense line, we will as mentioned last quarter, see the benefit of our productivity outweigh the investments that weÂre making and that should generate another $500 to $600 million over the course of 2019, that will be available to either fund expenses related to volume growth and certainly contribute to the overall performance metrics that we mentioned.
I think Glenn, what weÂve talked about and I think what Mark pointed out in his remarks is we think weÂve got the ability to manage the cost lines there and to manage both EBIT growth as well as returns.
I think weÂre starting to see the ability to pull the levers on positive operating leverage and sustainability of that, at the same time through some of the other things, weÂve done optimization et cetera not only drive EBITDA, drive net income, but also drive returns.
So I think if we saw growth rates continue to slow a bit, I think weÂve got the ability to manage through that and continue to still get the growth we want there at the bottom line in returns.
And if I could follow-up on John's and your answer on his card question; offering card customers tailored rewards to bring in banking business, happen to be a big fan of that, but I think it's getting a little active where you and a couple other big players are doing that.
And so, we think weÂre showing good sign for when that market does return in terms of the broader market activity to capture some of that upside given the account growth and given the investment AUMs weÂve been growing.
I think as youÂve seen our ability to drive leading performance in terms of operating efficiency, but if it comes down to the choice of not being able to make an investment in an area that we view as critical or accretive or something its offering real opportunity versus hitting the target I think our shareholders have been very clear certainly to me and to Mark that they would want us to make that investment.
I think the tax rate certainly, we came in lower this quarter, but we talked about that being at about 23% for the full year.
So, retail banking for North America, we started to see I think some good growth this quarter particularly if you exclude mortgages.
As I mentioned weÂre seeing deposit growth there that's going to help on the revenue line and we expect that to continue as we execute against that strategy.
I donÂt think thereÂs anything in particular in the way of expenses except, what I would say is that the productivity that weÂve talked about is going to start and will continue to play out through the balance of the year, and so that's going to help when you look at kind of the retail banking profitability in the outer quarters.
So, to be clear we do expect to see revenue growth through the balance of the year, and so that obviously will drive some expense dollars with that.
So the combination of those two things combined with what we're seeing in the way of growth in our business and/or opportunities that we think makes sense to invest will get us to kind of a core number in terms of what would be available for us to return to shareholders.
",50.09,0.89808077
CITI,q2,2019,"In North America, that was led by continued strong performance in branded cards, and again, we saw encouraging momentum in deposit growth, which accelerated from the first quarter; and internationally, net income was up 25%.
In our Institutional Clients Group, we delivered continued growth overall in our steadier transaction and accrual-type businesses showing the strength of our global client network, while we saw pressure in our market-sensitive businesses reflecting the broader industry even in products like Investment Banking, where we continued to gain share.
That said, there remains uncertainty with respect to the economic market and rate environment, but as we think -- I think, we've shown that our franchise can manage through these by focusing on the things that we can control.
Revenues of $18.8 billion grew 2% from the prior year, reflecting the Tradeweb gain, as well as solid results in consumer and overall growth in our accrual businesses in ICG.
Expenses declined 2% year-over-year as volume growth along with continued investments in the franchise were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets, resulting in our 11th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage.
In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $689 billion, as 4% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind-down of legacy assets, and deposits grew 5% with contribution from both our consumer and institutional franchises.
Looking at results for the first half of 2019, we saw continued momentum in consumer, as well as the accrual businesses in ICG, which helped to offset the headwinds of lower market-sensitive revenues, along with the continued wind-down of legacy assets.
In total, operating expenses were down 1% in the second quarter, as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume-driven growth and cost of credit was down 3% reflecting a smaller LLR build relative to the prior year.
Turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 8, revenues of $9.7 billion were roughly flat in the second quarter and down 3% excluding the Tradeweb gain, as continued momentum in the accrual businesses was more than offset by lower market-sensitive revenues and the negative impact from mark-to-market losses on loan hedges as credit spreads further tightened in the quarter.
Looking at the first half of the year in ICG, our operating margin improved by 1% as solid contributions from our growing higher returning network businesses, most notably TTS and Securities Services, were largely offset by the decline in our market-sensitive business.
We are investing in technology to further digitize and improve our on-boarding processes, enhance our client-facing platforms, and roll out new capabilities across the franchise as we support the growth in cross-border flows that we are seeing with our multi-national clients, and we have a strong pipeline of initiatives going forward.
In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of nearly $12 billion this quarter grew by roughly $450 million year-over-year, reflecting higher rates, loan growth and a favorable loan mix, as well as higher trading-related NIR, along with the absence of the FDIC surcharge.
However, net interest margin declined five basis points sequentially, as the benefit of our revenues was more than offset by higher cash balances, reflecting strong deposit growth in the quarter.
We continue to estimate that each 25 basis point cut in U.S. rates impacts revenues by roughly $50 million on a quarterly basis, but, of course, this will depend on the competitive environment for deposits and other factors.
So, the rate environment continues to evolve, but we are managing our rate sensitivity carefully, and we continue to expect to generate net interest revenue growth this year of about 4% in constant dollars, which equates to roughly $2 billion of growth as we've discussed on previous earnings calls.
In the second quarter, while we saw pressure in underlying markets revenues, it was entirely offset by the Tradeweb gain, so non-interest revenues were flat to last year.
Looking ahead to the second half of 2019, as a reminder, in consumer, we will be comparing to the third quarter of 2018 when we had a $250 million gain on the sale of our asset management business in Mexico.
However, we should be able to more than offset this headwind with organic growth across the rest of our accrual and consumer businesses, and we should see a favorable comparison in markets revenues in the fourth quarter, even if investor client activity remains muted, similar to what we've seen so far this year.
From a revenue perspective, we are seeing solid momentum across the consumer franchise and continued growth in our accrual businesses in ICG.
Looking ahead, we will maintain this expense discipline relative to the revenue environment, while continuing to make essential investments in the franchise, including investments in infrastructure and controls, but we do expect expenses to be lower on a sequential basis from the first half to the second half of the year.
In ICG, we expect continued year-over-year growth in our accrual businesses as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network and markets and investment banking revenues should reflect the overall market environment.
As we think about levers to kind of keep that up in the second half and push over the goal line to get above 12% for the year, second half often has not as strong capital markets, obviously, haven't been so good this quarter -- so far this year.
The good news is that we have seen continued momentum in the consumer franchise, particularly in branded cards as we've talked about over the past couple of quarters with very strong performance this quarter as well on the heels of us converting those promotional balances to more average interest earning balances.
You heard me mention, the international franchises which are growing to have continued growth in the balance of the year and where there's muted growth to have -- to offset that with expense management and therefore have EBIT growth particularly in the case of Latin America.
The big area where the uncertainty in the environment you can pick the factor, whether it's the direct -- what's going on with rates and volatility around that or trade and tariff discussions, it plays out through the market sensitive business.
I mean, when you look at the profitability just in general on the consumer business, it does tend to skew towards the back half of the year because of things like marketing spend.
So, if you look at the 12% decline in non-interest bearing deposits and the 9% increase in interest-bearing deposits and then also the seven basis point rise in deposit costs sequentially and then the drop in loan yields, those trends combined, while not surprising, you would think from the outside would be a more negative tone on NII, but I think your guide was actually pretty good.
And as we look at that, we've obviously factored in at this point not only the shift that you mentioned from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing, but also the likelihood of a rate reduction based on the talk that is out there.
And so as we look at -- and look at kind of the continued momentum on the card side, and we look at the end of the deposit growth that we're seeing particularly in the TTS franchise with higher volumes a growth of 10% or so, we feel pretty good about our ability to get to that 4% growth in NIR.
In terms of the pricing of the loan, that is -- both a by-product of what we're seeing in the market, on the way of competition from a pricing point of view and obviously -- and the funding cost that we have.
As we get greater clarity on those things, we will obviously continue to kind of look at that, but that remains the target going forward.
And the way we think about the return of capital distribution of capital going forward is, largely as we get close to that 11.5%, which we expect to get close to towards the end of the year will be around how much capital we generate just opposed against how much we need to continue to grow.
Its -- these things kind of take time to play out, I think as we've seen over the past couple of years.
But given just the $50 million impact for 20 -- for the quarter from 20 to 25 basis points of cut, presumably even if we do get one cut or two cuts, it seems like you're confident that you can get NII growth in the back end of the year versus the first half?
And one final one from me, a large portion of the expected profitability expansion in North America consumer comes from right-sizing the profitability in retail banking and you gave some positive commentary obviously and you feel pleased about the momentum in terms of deposits, the inflows, the digital strategies, tapping your cards network or your cards clients.
But you also have a lower rate environment and deposit spreads is likely going to come in and I think you didn't have any growth in revenues in retail banking.
And so, over time, I think it's going to be more challenging to look at just the retail banking portion of that we breakout in income, because of that broader client strategy.
In fact, what you heard me mention earlier in terms of one of the protected areas being infrastructure and control, they are coupled with the different ways to look at that protected area as we invest in technology around our infrastructure and improve the data quality that we have and things of that sort, not only does it help us run a safer and more sound organization, but it also arms us with information sooner to enable us to react and serve our clients more quickly.
We do see benefits from technology playing out in these -- in the expense line and in the productivity savings that are referenced both in 2019 and 2020 and likely beyond and those things will help in getting us to the lower levels of operating efficiency that we've talked about achieving over time.
You can also look at the first half of the year or the fourth quarter of last year and witness strength in the franchise, on the consumer side, on your core side of the business, but you can also witness the impact of the environment that we're in and the uncertainty around that.
Despite that uncertainty, we've gotten to 11.9% in the first half through pulling a number of levers and we would expect to continue to pull those levers into the back half of this year to the extent that that uncertainty increases, or there is more significant reaction from the market to the uncertainty, we'll of course look and work to find additional levers, but at some point that becomes challenged, in terms of getting to that 12% just given things we want to protect in this franchise.
We'll see how this year plays out, given all of the uncertainty referenced and we'll go into 2020 with the 13.5% remaining our target and with clarity on where we think we'll end up against it.
And I think from our perspective, we don't believe that the market has made that full adjustment, and there's probably some terms that's got to come as portfolio set-up for that potential lower rate environment.
The question is when will that come and to what degree will that come, will there -- will we get conviction in terms of the trajectory of this lower rate environment and portfolios have to reposition, because I think today, they're not positioned where they need to be fully.
Could you just give us a sense of how that was relative to expectations and what you think the major drivers were for generating that growth speaking to rate versus marketing versus any other factors that you want to add?
I would say, we would expect continued growth in the deposits in the back half of the year.
It is a combination of -- and if you think about our strategy again to target card customers, a good portion of the deposit growth that we achieved were outside of our six markets and with our card customers who did not have a retail banking relationship.
Some of it is rate, yes, but it's a combination of all of those things and we expect continued growth.
Again, we could very well see, as Mike suggested, the market having to react to a rate reduction and certainty around the direction in a way that is favorable to trading businesses, but we've got to, kind of, wait and see how some of that plays out.
And so investments or the digital capabilities that we invested in from technology point of view, the organizational business model structure that we put in place in terms of our retail activity there and all of those things are starting to play out as expected.
And then, we're tempering growth in terms of the loan activity, loan volume in light of what's going on in the economy and that obviously helps at least -- as we think about expected cost of credit and what else, so those are number of factors that play out there.
Today, we are joined by Citi's Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason.
On our call today our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first; then Mark Mason, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website citigroup.com.
We delivered positive operating leverage for the 11th straight quarter and improved our efficiency, while again growing loans and deposits.
Our $21.5 billion capital return will increase the three-year total to $62.3 billion and includes raising our dividend to $0.51 and continuing to buy back shares of common stock at roughly the same level as last year's plans.
Given the current environment and market conditions, we'll stay flexible with a focus on making steady progress towards our financial targets through client led growth and research discipline, including balance sheet, credit, and expenses.
Starting on slide three, net income of $4.8 billion in the second quarter grew 7% from last year, including a roughly $350 million pre-tax gain on our investment in Tradeweb, which benefited EPS by $0.12 per share.
And cost of credit increased, driven by volume growth and seasoning as well as a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio while overall credit quality remained stable.
Revenues grew 4% with contribution from all regions while expenses were up 1% driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings.
In digital, we further enhanced our account opening process and launched new products designed to deepen our client relationships, including relationship-based offers that leverage our proprietary banking and double cash rewards across both card and deposit products.
Results from our new digital lending product Flex Loan also continue to be positive, following its launch in January, as loan originations more than tripled from the first to the second quarter, while maintaining a strong credit profile.
Mortgage revenues were largely stable again this quarter on a sequential basis, but declined year-over-year mostly reflecting higher funding cost.
Client engagement remained strong with purchase sales up 8% and we continue to generate growth in interest-earning balances this quarter up about 10%.
Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 1%, driven by loan growth partially offset by higher contractual partner payments.
Total expenses for North America consumer were up 2% year-over-year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were largely offset by efficiency savings.
Net credit losses grew by 12% year-over-year reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios.
Our performance year-to-date is in line with our full NCL rate outlook for both branded cards and retail services at 300 to 325 basis points and 500 to 525 basis points respectively.
Second quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew 4%.
In Latin America total consumer revenues grew 3% or 5% on an underlying basis excluding the impact of the sale of our asset management business last year.
Treasury & Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 4% as reported and 7% in constant dollars with growth in deposits, transaction volumes and trade spreads reflecting continued strong client engagement.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 10% from last year, while outperforming the market wallet.
Private Bank revenues of $866 million were up 2%, reflecting growth with both new and existing clients, which drove higher lending, deposits, and AUM volumes, partially offset by spread compression.
And Corporate Lending revenues of $538 million were down 9%, reflecting lower spreads and higher hedging cost.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.7 billion were down 4% from last year, excluding the Tradeweb gain, as growth in Securities Services was more than offset by the decline in our markets businesses where the environment has been challenging and investor client activity has remained muted.
Excluding Tradeweb, Fixed Income revenues declined 4% year-over-year, reflecting the challenging trading environment particularly in rates.
Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion declined 2% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investments in volume-driven growth.
On a sequential basis, net interest revenue grew by roughly $230 million, largely reflecting higher trading-related NIR, along with one additional day in the quarter.
In the second quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 10% year-over-year to $67.64, driven by net income and a lower share count, and our CET1 capital ratio was stable sequentially at 11.9%, as net income was offset by $4.6 billion of total common share buybacks and dividends.
On an underlying basis, similar to the results seen so far this year, revenue growth will likely remain somewhat muted, although we expect continued strong growth in pre-tax earnings.
For total Citigroup, expenses should decline sequentially and cost of credit should continue to grow modestly year-over-year, reflecting volume growth and continued normalization in ICG.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
Hi. Interest-bearing deposit rates paid was up 7 basis points without any kind of a hike.
I think from a trade perspective, I would say -- I don't want to say BAU, the business activity remains fairly strong.
Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
So I guess what I'd say is obviously our fixed income revenues for the quarter were down about 4% if you exclude the gain from Tradeweb.
And can you maybe just speak to some of the unique aspects of the business like trading -- trade finance that should drive some lower loss levels through the cycle since that was actually pretty encouraging commentary from our point of view?
Yes. But when we look at that juxtaposed against the internal metrics that we use, whether that would be card usage patterns or utilization or payment rates or the percentage of customers making minimum payments.
Yes. But instead tied towards growth that we've had in both with multinational clients that are large and that we've been with for a long time, but also new emerging clients as they've entered into new markets, new countries and we've been there to assist them with how they kind of grow their businesses and operations in those new environments where whether it be working capital or supply chain needs that they've had.
Look, I mean, we -- obviously, the volatility around rate movement has been pretty significant over the past couple of quarters from us -- from an increase to now a reduction and possibly three reductions.
I think you dropped about 500 basis points, which was the lowest in maybe four or five years.

CITI,q3,2019,"Hello and welcome to Citi's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason.
Good morning and thank you all for joining us.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
Thank you, Liz and good morning everyone.
Deposit momentum continued with a strong contribution from both traditional and digital channels as we leveraged our brand and scale in credit cards to drive deeper, multiproduct relationships with our clients.
Our institutional clients group also had balanced performance with solid results in both the market-sensitive and accrual-type businesses.
Our share gains continued at Investment Banking, while our Markets performance showed resilience due to strong client engagement.
And cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning in consumer, while overall credit quality remained stable.
Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking in more detail.
Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 1% driven by organic loan growth.
Total expenses for North America consumer were down 2% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and higher volume related expenses.
Our NCL rate in U.S. Branded Cards and Retail Services were 312 basis points and 477 basis points, respectively, this quarter, consistently with our full year guidance.
We continue to see strong growth in our underlying wealth management drivers in Asia with 9% growth in Citigold clients and 7% growth in net new money versus last year.
In total, operating expenses were largely unchanged in the third quarter as efficiency savings offset investment spending and volume-driven growth.
Treasury & Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 6% as reported and 7% in constant dollars, as we continued to see strong client engagement and solid growth in transaction volumes, partially offset by spread compression.
Private Bank revenues of $867 million were up 2% driven by higher lending and deposit volumes as well as increased investment activity with both new and existing clients, partially offset by spread compression.
And Corporate Lending revenues of $527 million were down 6% reflecting lower spreads and higher hedging costs.
And credit quality remains strong, consistent with our target client strategy.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
But have you thought about how CECL in an environment where maybe things don't really deteriorate much where we don't have a big change of the macro backdrop towards the team, how CECL impacts your ongoing level of provisioning going forward and so just kind of maybe thinking through some of the puts and takes of that?
Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
As I think back over the last two to three years as rates were rising, higher funding costs were consistently highlighted as a drag on your liability-sensitive trading book.
Now with rates declining, we're really not seeing that benefit from lower funding costs on the way down and I was hoping you could help us unpack what's happening on the trading side.
But I guess thinking -- even taking a more holistic view, looking at principal transactions plus NII as the key trading proxy, it sounds like you should still see some benefit on the funding side over time as rates do come down.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Because it does feel like great brand value, maybe a little bit underlevered in the revenue line here; and so, I'm just wondering, do you build on that with incremental products like mortgage across these different geographies, kind of going back to where you were pre-crisis where you were much more nationwide and a much broader set of products?
Can you talk about just like what happens post 2019 in terms of your willingness to let the CET1 ratio continue to come down in the context of still seeing a big capital return number and given what the outlook is for earnings underneath?
We do we actually do expect I think I've mentioned the outlook for Corporate/Other being slightly higher going into the fourth quarter as a result of continued infrastructure costs.
And I think you've seen over the last three or four years, some pretty consistent market share gains for us there.
And your final question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
Starting on Slide 3, net income of $4.9 billion in the third quarter grew 6% from last year and EPS grew 20%, mostly driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding, as we've continued to buy back shares throughout the year, consistent with our capital plan.
Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 1% from the prior year and were up 2% excluding the roughly $250 million gain on the sale of our asset management business in Mexico last year, reflecting solid results across both our consumer and institutional businesses.
Expenses increased 1% year-over-year as volume growth, along with continued investments in the franchise were partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets.
In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 4% year-over-year to $692 billion, as 5% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind-down of legacy assets and deposits grew 9% with contributions from both our consumer and institutional franchises.
Revenues were up 3% on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of FX as well as the roughly $150 million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio in the first quarter of 2018 and the previously mentioned gain on the asset management business in Mexico.
On the institutional side, revenues are up 2% year-to-date with continued growth in our accrual businesses.
Expenses declined 1% year-to-date even as we continued to make critical investments in our franchise and underlying pretax earnings grew by 4%.
Excluding the gain last year, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses were down 1%, driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings.
And looking at year-to-date results in consumer, excluding both gains in 2018, we generated 4% revenue growth while expenses were roughly flat, resulting in 9% growth in operating margin and 12% growth in pretax earnings.
This growth in interest-earning balances drove a year-over-year improvement in our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans to 914 basis points this quarter.
But importantly, we are managing expenses carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns, as seen again this quarter in our strong EBIT growth year-over-year.
Revenues of $9.5 billion were up 3% in the third quarter, reflecting continued momentum in TTS and the Private Bank, combined with strong performance in Investment Banking and stability in fixed income markets, partially offset by softness in equity markets and corporate lending.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 4% from last year, outperforming the market wallet, reflecting continued strength in debt underwriting and strong performance in M&A, particularly in EMEA.
Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion increased 4% year-over-year, as investments, volume-driven growth and higher compensation costs were partially offset by efficiency savings.
Looking at year-to-date results in ICG, our operating margin improved by 1% as solid results in TTS and strength in Investment Banking were offset by the decline in Equity Markets' revenues.
As you can see, year-to-date net interest revenue grew by 4% or roughly $1.3 billion year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by 5% growth ex-Markets, reflecting strength in North America Branded Cards and TTS as well as the absence of the FDIC surcharge.
Looking at results for the quarter, net interest revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and declined by roughly $250 million sequentially, reflecting the impact of lower Markets' net interest revenue.
So, while we did see pressure in net interest revenues, driven by the dynamic seen this quarter in Markets, which could continue into the fourth quarter, in total for Citigroup, we remain comfortable in our ability to generate modest year-over-year revenue growth in 2019 on a reported basis, driven by net interest revenue growth of 2% to 3% in constant dollars for the full year below our original forecast, given the dynamic I just mentioned in Markets, but offset by higher noninterest revenue, which should be better than our original forecast of at least flat to 2018 on a full year basis.
In ICG, Markets and Investment Banking revenues should reflect the overall environment, but we are not anticipating a repeat of the challenging trading environment seen in the fourth quarter of last year.
And in our accrual businesses, revenues should benefit from continued strong client engagement and higher volumes.
In consumer, we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in all regions, driven by continued loan and deposit growth, partially offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads.
For total Citigroup, expenses should decline sequentially, cost of credit should continue to grow modestly, and importantly we expect solid pre-tax earnings growth year-over-year.
I think I heard your comment about where part of the relationship is coming in, and how you're growing in the bank on non-bank customers through the card portfolio, but just focus specifically around the 11% growth in Branded Cards, talk about balance transfer and how the box you're writing to?
We are, yeah, as we think about investments we've made in technology and our ability to mine the data that we have of our customers, we're able to create value propositions that they're likely to respond to and open-up a retail banking account with us.
Mark, just want to confirm, for 2019, still feeling good about 12% or a darn close to 12% for this year given your fourth quarter outlook.
It's a very different environment than I think we expected kind of coming into the year.
And we need to factor in the uncertainty that's in the environment, what that's likely to look like, or how that's likely to play out, what the impact Â the full year impact in 2020 of the rate reductions might be, what we think client demand is going to look like.
And so we really need to get through the budgeting process to both understand what we think that top line is likely to look like, understand what levers we have available to us to pull in order to continue to demonstrate progress, and see what we might be able to do to narrow that gap and deliver on our targets.
And I think as Mark alluded to, John, the other thing that I very much want to do is get the benefit of continuing to talk to our clients in terms of how they're thinking about things.
We want to continue to gain information from our clients, not just here in the U.S., but around the world in terms of how they're thinking about things.
And then lastly and you alluded to it, but it certainly played out in this quarter as well, as we've seen pressure on some of the wallets, and as we've thought about kind of the long-term -- or longer-term business model and benefits from technology that will play out, we've made some capacity adjustments.
So we think we -- look, I mean obviously in adjusting the capacity here, we're going to see some benefits of that play out in 2020.
But -- so the question is, growing revenue's faster than expenses, when you look back a bit ago, you were kind of doing it by like a touchdown or 2.
So one here, Mike, I think is if you go and you look at the numbers, I would say, relatively, quietly, as Mark alluded to over the past year, our head count was down by about 7,000, so somewhere between 3% and 4%.
I think clearly, technology, when you go back to slide 23 and look at our consumer business and some of the drivers around contact rates, digital mobile engagement, e-statement penetration, all of those moving, I think, very nicely in the right direction.
But just like last year's fourth quarter, when I know you were disappointed, what I don't want to commit to is in some environment, having to do things that don't make sense for the long-term.
So, what I mean by that is if you think about what we talked about in the way of capacity adjustments that we've had to make and the repositioning around that, those are increased expenses that we're having to take in the quarter and through the year.
But given what you know about your current rate sensitivity, what the forward curve is telling you right now where long rates are at, what you're seeing in the economy, how confident are you that some revenue is still the base case for 2020 -- some revenue growth target is still the base case for next year?
And I do -- I mean I do -- we do expect to see continued growth in our cards business.
And it seems like, you are growing in higher loss content lending in the U.S. Obviously, the composition of the balance of the portfolio in any given quarter is going to be an important factor in estimating what that impact will be.
So, I think -- look I think it's -- if you turn the page that page 11 kind of highlighted the mix that -- the dynamic that you're referencing and that I spoke to which is that, we're obviously seeing lower NIR on our -- from our Markets business that's completely -- that's being completely offset in markets non-NIR.
And while you're right, that we have talked about funding costs and its impact and there is a funding cost benefit that plays through as rates come down, the dynamic around the markets revenues is overshadowing that, if you will.
It depends on your definition of inorganic and so again, if we continue to find, as an example, portfolios of loans or cards or those types of things that we can acquire and fit from a client demography perspective, fit from a business line perspective and obviously are accretive to our returns, wide open to it.
And again, I think you've seen what we've done there in terms of on the consumer side, the institutional side, using the digital strategy to not just reinforce but continue to grow our franchise.
And just a follow-up to Glenn's question earlier, year-over-year growth in Branded Card revenues of 11%, you noted, Mark, that you're sort of at the right shift in terms of the mix in that portfolio.
And I think our ability to move with our clients in terms of what that means has us pretty well positioned out there and it something we're obviously wanting to make sure we're in the room and is part of.
And I think as Mark referenced in the numbers and some of the experiments that we've doing on the deposit site, our ability to grow outside of footprint of the deposits brought in not just in the quarter, but really year-to-date, 2/3 of those brought in outside of those six markets.
The only thing I'd add to your point around continued progress is if you look back to 2018 and we had a target of a 10.5% RoTCE, we were able to deliver on the 10.9%.
And we've been doing that over the past quarter or so as we've seen interest rates come down, and you should expect that we'll continue to do that to be aligned with the market.

CITI,q4,2019,"Today, weÂre joined by CitiÂs Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; the Chief Financial Officer -- and Mark Mason, CFO.
Good revenue growth paired with disciplined expense management allowed us to deliver positive operating leverage, even as we continue to make significant investments in the franchise.
Both North America and international consumer banking had 4% year-over-year revenue growth.
Treasury and Trade Solutions continued to grow, despite a lower rate environment as we work to ensure our global network remains indispensable to our multinational clients.
Now, let me turn it over to Mark and then weÂd be happy to answer your questions.
In Global Consumer Banking, we generated 4% revenue growth across all three regions.
Slide five shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
Slide six shows the results for North America Consumer Banking in more detail.
Total expenses for North America consumer were down 4% year-over-year as efficiency savings, more than offset investment spending and higher volume related expenses.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were up 6% from last year, outperforming the market wallet, reflecting strong performance in equity and debt underwriting, particularly investment-grade underwriting as we leveraged our global capabilities to help clients optimize their funding needs.
Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.9 billion were up 28% from last year.
And credit costs increased to $246 million, reflecting overall volume growth as well as a few episodic downgrades while overall portfolio quality remains strong.
The combined solid performance in these businesses helped to more than offset weakness in equities and deliver positive operating leverage for the year.
Revenues of $542 million increased 8% from last year, reflecting gains on investments partially offset by the wind down of legacy assets.
[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous.
Well, let me -- Mark, why donÂt I start and maybe just talk a little bit about the revenue environment and what may drive.
The next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
WeÂll go into a fair bit of this in detail at our Investor Day. YouÂve asked a question before in data centers.
The next question will come from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
Do you think continued improvement could be realized from here, if we keep the rate curve fairly flat and thereÂs no major change in the global economic outlook?
The next question will come from Matt OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
And the benefits that those clients are realizing as we invest in technologies that bring those product capabilities together to create solutions that allow them to run their operations more efficiently, and so more traction there would be a second thing that you would look to I think.
When I look at your revenue growth of 2019 as a starting point, you had about $1 billion improvement [Technical Difficulty] when I see that was about 2%.
So, what do you do -- what can you do tangibly now differently to really get that revenue growth going again, because full year Â19 was -- youÂre at the lower end of where youÂve been in the last five years?
Yes. But, it seems like weÂre coming in somewhere about flat to market wallet where we had the past several years taken share.
The final question is a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Yes. WeÂre gearing up for Investor Day. Mike Mayo
We ended the year in a strong capital position with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.7%, and weÂre on track to deliver our Investor Day commitment of returning more than $60 billion of capital to our shareholders over three CCAR cycles, having returned over $22 billion in 2019 alone.
Starting on Slide three, net income of $5 billion in the fourth quarter grew 18% from last year, as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate.
Revenues of $18.4 billion grew 7% from the prior year, driven by higher noninterest revenue and reflecting continued solid results across consumer as well as our accrual businesses in ICG, along with a rebound in markets.
Expenses increased 6% year-over-year, reflecting higher compensation and volume-related expenses, along with continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets.
In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $699 billion as 3% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind down of legacy assets, and deposits grew 6% with contributions from both our consumer and institutional franchises.
Looking at 2019, our progress was broad-based with revenue growth, positive operating leverage, and operating margin expansion across both our consumer and institutional businesses.
And even as weÂve continued to make critical investments in our franchise, we maintained expense discipline delivering roughly flat expenses for the year, in line with our outlook.
For the quarter, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses were down 1%, driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings.
And looking at full year results in consumer, excluding both gains in 2018, we also generated 4% revenue growth while expenses were roughly flat, resulting in 9% growth in operating margin and 13% growth in pretax earnings.
Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion were up 1% year-over-year, with continued growth in loans and purchase sales across the majority of the portfolio.
In total, operating expenses for International Consumer Banking increased 3% in the fourth quarter as investment spending and volume-driven growth was partially offset by efficiency savings, and cost of credit was down 6%, driven primarily by Mexico.
Revenues of $9.4 billion were up 10% in the fourth quarter, reflecting continued momentum in the accrual businesses as well as strong performance in both Investment Banking and Fixed Income markets, partially offset by softness in equity markets.
Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.6 billion were up 2% as reported, and 3% in constant dollars, as we drove strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits and transaction volumes, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates.
Private Bank revenues of $847 million were up 6%, driven by higher lending and increased investment activity with both new and existing clients, partially offset by spread compression, and corporate lending revenues of $732 million were roughly flat as growth in the commercial book was offset by lower volumes in the rest of the portfolio.
Fixed Income revenues were up 49%, largely reflecting a recovery from the fourth quarter 2018, coupled with strong performance, particularly in rates and spread products.
For full year 2019, our net income grew 3%, on the combination of revenue growth, positive operating leverage, continued credit discipline, and a lower tax rate.
From a client perspective, our revenue growth was largely driven by continued strong engagement with our corporate clients across TTS and Investment Banking, as well as both Fixed Income and equity markets.
And looking at our results from a product perspective, we generated over half our revenues in banking, which grew 3% as reported and 5% in constant dollars on continued momentum in TTS, Investment Banking and the Private Bank.
Looking ahead for 2020, we would expect a quarterly pre-tax loss of roughly $250 million in Corporate/Other as we continue to invest in infrastructure and controls and see some impact from lower rates, as well as a reduced level of gains.
As you can see, we delivered 3% growth in net interest revenue or roughly $1.4 billion year-over-year in constant dollars in 2019, in line with the high end of our latest outlook, mainly reflecting strength in North America Branded Cards and TTS.
Looking at results for the quarter, we saw a rebound in markets, net interest revenues, both year-over-year and sequentially, while growth in the rest of the franchise was more than offset by the headwinds of lower rates.
Looking ahead to 2020, we do expect to deliver some growth in net interest revenues this year, despite the change in the direction of rates as loan growth and mix become the primary drivers, and we remain comfortable in our ability to deliver continued growth in noninterest revenues this year, driven by continued fee growth across both our consumer and institutional businesses.
As Mike mentioned, the revenue environment has changed since we set our targets for 2020 with lower interest rates, slower global growth and the pressure weÂve seen in industry wallets in markets and banking.
So, we expect we will continue to make progress in improving our returns, and we look forward to having the opportunity to talk more about this year and beyond at our Investor Day in May. With that Mike and I are happy to take any questions.
So, weÂve seen good deposit growth, as you said through the year in both our consumer business as well as on the institutional side, and that in many ways I think is an important proof point around our consumer strategy.
That said, weÂve delivered on the 1% weÂve talked about as guidance for the revenue growth for the quarter and I think itÂs 2% for the full year.
So, look, I think itÂs -- if you think about what we saw this year and some of the key important drivers of performance, you can kind of look across many of the businesses and see good top-line growth underlying and good EBIT performance.
And the combination of that and continued work on the cost of credit, and of course, weÂll continue to look at the tax line, but we believe the combination of that focus and continued productivity benefits funding the volume growth that we expect to have will get us to the range of the 12 to 13 that I referenced.
So, is it some unusual items in the back half of the year, accelerated spending that you expect to slow, or if we see a higher revenue growth, is that going to be offset by volume-related expenses and you just canÂt get a ton of operating leverage.
With that said, there are a couple of things that are playing through that that I think will benefit the expense line in 2020, and cover any volume-related increases or investments that weÂre planning to make.
And particularly, if you look at the ICG in the last quarter, you got to kind of keep in mind that that growth in expenses is 10% topline growth, 8% expense growth but that comes with the compensation increase associated with those revenues, the volume increases associated with that activity that we saw in the back half of the year.
Mike, does the 12% to 13% RoTCE for this year fully capture the potential of the franchise or -- and I expect you to give us more detail on Investor Day. Again, weÂve kind of talked about the steps along the way.
And we think weÂve got the ability using technology, client engagement, wallet share gains, a lot of the levers that weÂve spoken to on the revenue and expense side of continuing to make improvement and make progress against those benchmarks.
I think, as we look at things that weÂve done, youÂve seen us adjusting in particular front end capacity against the business, in particular in terms of cash, making investments in Delta One derivatives prime broker.
So, the dynamic, it kind of move away from just capital is being the driver to actually now the fundamentals of the business starting to perk up a little bit going into this next Investor Day. But, I think as we look towards the future I think one is that our levels of client engagement and what youÂve seen since Investor Day, we talked about revenue gains coming off of kind of potential wallet expansion, but in particular market share gains.
And I would expect at Investor Day, we are going to talk more about that as the things we do, I think continue to resonate with the clients, as the investments that weÂve made in our products, the investments that weÂve made in service, I think continue to reap good benefits.
If weÂre just talking on this call a year from now and you guys have better-than-expected than modest total revenue growth, what are some of the data points do you think we need to look at throughout the year where the revenue growth could come in stronger?
The second category is, as I think about our global corporate client in our Institutional Clients Group, and the continued great engagement that weÂre seeing with those clients, not just in -- in TTS around the world, not just existing clients, but new clients that weÂve been able to onboard and grow with very rapidly, not just cash management products, but also with capital markets offerings, like our FX capabilities.

CITI,q1,2020,"Our accrual businesses reflect the impact of the three US rate cuts seen last year, as well as some impact from additional cuts seen this quarter in response to the crisis, with an expectation for a more pronounced impact going forward.
Additionally, we had over $800 billion in available liquidity to help support our clients, and including the $4.1 billion transition impact as we adopted CECL at the beginning of the year, as well as the additional reserves taken this quarter, credit reserves stand at roughly $23 billion with a reserve ratio of 2.9% on funded loans.
Total credit costs of $4.8 billion were up significantly from last year, including a reserve build of approximately $2.8 billion, primarily related to the impact of changes in our economic outlook.
So in total, we grew a purchase sale of 3% in branded cards in the first quarter, but the trend line over the past month would indicate a significant decline in purchase activity in the second quarter, which is expected to impact loan growth.
And while we havenÂt yet seen the full impact from COVID-19 in Mexico, we did see a slowdown in purchase sales in March, which is expected to continue as customer behavior will likely follow the pattern weÂve seen in other regions.
In total, operating expenses for our international business were up 3% in the first quarter, driven by Mexico, reflecting investments as well as episodic items partially offset by efficiency savings and cost of credit increased to $939 million, primarily driven by the impact of changes in our economic outlook.
Revenues of $12.5 billion increased 25% in the first quarter, as strong performance in fixed income and equity markets as well as the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in TTS and corporate lending.
Treasury and Trade Solution revenues of $2.4 billion were down 5% as reported and 2% in constant dollars, as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates.
And while average loans were roughly flat, we did see a meaningful increase in end-of-period loans this quarter, reflecting the drawdowns and new facilities that I mentioned earlier, as we continue to support our clients.
Equities revenues of $1.2 billion were up 39% versus last year, reflecting a strong performance in derivatives, including an increase in client activity due to higher volatility.
Overall, we feel good about our corporate credit quality and like consumer, we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio and reserve levels relative to the stresses we see out there today.
Revenues of $73 million declined significantly from last year, reflecting the wind down of legacy asset, the impact of lower rates, as well as marks on legacy securities as spreads widened during the quarter.
And the pretax loss was $535 million this quarter, higher than our previous outlook, reflecting loan loss reserves on our legacy portfolio, locks on security, the impact of lower rates as well as the special compensation award.
On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $330 million, reflecting the lower rate environment, one fewer day in the quarter and the adjustment in corporate lending that I mentioned earlier.
Based on what weÂre seeing today, on the top line, we expect the revenue trend in the latter part of March and the beginning of April characterized by COVID related lower level of activity, particularly in banking, and our consumer franchise, will continue through much of the second quarter.
On the expense side, there are couple things that are important to consider as we think about running the franchise and managing our expenses, including the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, how do we continue to protect our employees who are on the front line and how do we ensure that we are able to help our customers manage through this.
So you know, you can turn to page 20, weÂve broken out some additional you know, details here and you can see you know, we started or ended the year, I should say with about $14 billion in reserves, youÂre right the lionÂs share that is in cards in split between branded you know, and retail and you know our focus obviously is tends to be on the higher Â the higher FICO scored you know, clients and that skews certainly the case in cards and tends to be higher on retail services, but not quite as high as on the cardsÂ side.
So lots of puts and takes going you know, through the model, the Â those economic assumptions change kind of straight through the end of the quarter, but the short of it is that you know, based on our outlook as have been you know, this additional build of $2.4 billion per cards you know was the appropriate amount for us to take.
Yeah, Glenn, I would say that the actions that weÂve seen out of the combination of the Fed and the Treasury are truly extraordinary, not just in terms of the volume of dollars and programs, but I think the breath thatÂs there and the speed at which theyÂve implemented them I mean, whether itÂs it's been the CP facility, the money market liquidity facility, the repo facilities, the broader corporate pieces, the SBA loans and now not something thatÂs being talked about that much, but this main street program thatÂs there.
Yeah, sure I mean, what I said was that you know, if you take the cards portfolio we have today which is of a better quality, then it was back in Â08, and you were to stress it for the Â08 financial crisis that yes, our pro forma loss rates would be 25% to 30% lower than what we experienced in the last crisis.
And youÂve seen our CET1 ratio dropped to 11.2% this quarter and as the needs of our clients evolve, weÂre going to be there for them and that means that our ratio takes more pressure than weÂll manage through that.
Do you expect them to persist for you know, many quarters, many years or do you think that you know, we will, over the next 12 months see some pay down of that through terming out in the capital markets and maybe also give us a sense as to the associated deposits, how much of the drawdowns came back into you know, your liquidity via the deposits and persistency there as well would be helpful?
But again, I think you know, certainly coming into the second quarter, weÂve actually seen really de minimis draws on the facilities and I think in our dialogues, we donÂt see or feel that pressure right now.
We are in conversations with our regulator and I think Mark said you know, we feel that weÂve got a lot of capacity in terms of capital and things that we can do before we get near triggering any conversations around dividend, but again, weÂre going to treat that as a time when it comes.
So if you kind of separate the branded cards from the retail services and just can you help us talk about just what youÂre seeing Â you know, relatively speaking in terms of we can see it in the rate of change that happened in the first quarter, but would you expect divergence in either spending trends, volume balances and credit as this evolves or any color you can help us with there?
And ultimately you know, as I said, we would expect the second quarter to have some of that top line pressure play through and over the course of the year to see a pickup in NCLs subject to, of course, how things like the $2 trillion relief package and some of the other customer relief offerings that we put out take hold.
So I mean, if you think about CECL and how it works in the idea of building expected lifetime losses in any given quarter, there are number of factors that come into play, you know, so your probability of recession, your severity of recession, our view on the important economic variables and how theyÂre going to play out as well as balances.
Maybe you could just talk about kind of whatÂs going on in Mexico and Asia and some of your bigger markets there in terms of you know things that might soften the blow for the consumer.
And we actually have been you know, very closely monitoring as youÂve seen over the past number of quarters our loan volumes have, in fact, trended lower than that of the broader industry as weÂve you know, been and quite vigilant about focus and staying inside of our risk parameters, which again, do skew higher than most of the peers in that country.
I would expect that you know, with that as a backdrop, and again, subject to a lot of things including how customers respond to the relief programs that are out there, so on and so forth that we would see additional builds in the second quarter.
You should have a little more of a head start than other banks that donÂt have that experience and what are you seeing in terms of you know, volumes and credit losses and your ability to work with the clients?
And frankly, as this continues to evolve with all of the uncertainty that it comes with, we would expect that weÂre going to be a critical partner to these large multinational clients as they think about what the new norm looks like.
Hello and welcome to CitiÂs First Quarter 2020 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason.
Our earnings were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we had strong revenue performance as the economic shocks caused by the pandemic werenÂt felt until late in the quarter and we continue to show expense discipline.
While weÂve built significant loan loss reserves, no one knows what the severity or longevity of the virusÂs impact on the global economy will be.
Investments weÂve made in our technology have allowed us to operate very smoothly in a set of circumstances that would have been hard to imagine with such a large share of our workforce working remotely at the same time.
These investments are also helping us to serve our clients through digital and mobile channels whether itÂs a consumer depositing a check or a corporate treasurer managing liquidity.
While we havenÂt been a large player in small business lending, weÂre ramping up our efforts so we can support clients who participate in the Payroll Protection Plan, and we have additional consumer relief programs in place in our international consumer franchise.
WeÂve also been helping the communities we served during this extraordinarily difficult time, partnering with groups like the World Health Organizations, CitiÂs foundations have already committed $30 million today to support those impacted and weÂll make additional announcements in coming days.
But we feel confident in our ability to manage through whatever scenario comes to pass and with that, Mark will go through our presentations and then weÂd be happy to answer your questions.
However, deposit growth remains strong across regions and weÂre leveraging digital channels to engage with our client.
WeÂre combining this financial strength with operational resiliency, given investments in our people, operations and technology along with digital capabilities which allow us to partner with and support our clients as we all manage through this crisis.
Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars.
Branded cards revenue of $2.3 billion grew 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% loan growth and continued spread expansion with net interest revenue as a percentage of loans improving to 933 basis points this quarter.
As I noted earlier, digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter even as we continue to adjust pricing, given the current rate environment.
While AUMs declined by 6% due to market movements, we drove continued growth in Citigold households and investment fees during the quarter and mortgage revenues grew as a result of increased refinancing activity.
Total expenses for North America Consumer were down 1% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume related costs.
This was offset by lower purchase sales activity and loan balances in our card business, driven by restrictions on movement and changes in customer behavior.
Turning to Latin America, total consumer revenues were largely unchanged year-over-year and grew 3% excluding a residual gain last year on the sale of our asset management business.
I would also note that we are taking appropriate actions to manage new and existing credit exposures, including investments in our operation.
The credit profile of our clients has improved over time, as we have remained disciplined and tightened down lending criteria since the crisis, which is reflected in our more stable NCL rates over the past few years.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were largely unchanged from last year, outperforming the market wallet as growth in M&A and equity underwriting were offset by decline in debt underwriting.
However, I would note that investment grade debt underwriting was up double-digits year-over-year, as we helped our clients source liquidity in this evolving environment.
Private bank revenues of $949 million grew 8%, driven by increased capital markets activity as we supported our clients through turbulent market conditions.
Total operating expenses of $5.8 billion increased 3% year-over-year as efficiency savings were more than offset by higher compensation costs, continued investments and volume-driven growth.
In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.5 billion this quarter declined slightly year-over-year as the impact of lower rates was mostly offset by loan growth and an extra day, along with higher trading related NIR.
Here we feel good about the investments weÂve made over the last few years in technology.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question is from the line of Matt OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Security.
But you know, first I want to get your perspective on the DFAST stress losses and whether you think itÂs a good reference point to judge reserve adequacy under CECL, because we do get a lot of questions asking why allowance level are so much below, what the nine quarter stress losses are in the severely adverse scenario in the adversary.
ItÂs about an 80 basis points against all the exposures, but yeah, youÂre looking at non-investment grade being 21% of the portfolio.

facebook,q2,2015,"We've continued to make good progress in the growth of our community with 1.49 billion people now using Facebook each month and more than 1.3 billion people using Facebook on mobile.
And when it comes to time spent across Facebook, Messenger and Instagram, people are now spending more than 46 minutes per day on average, and that doesn't include WhatsApp. This quarter, our total revenue is more than $4 billion for the first time, and advertising revenue grew by 43% year-over-year.
Now, with that in mind, I'd like to talk about how we're working on this across our current product, our next generation of apps and our long-term innovation efforts.
This quarter, we've continued to focus on improving people's experience in News Feed by making it easier to find more relevant and engaging content from friends and the entire community.
Video continues to be some of the richest and most engaging content for people and publishers, and since the start of the year, pages are also sharing more than 40% more videos.
This quarter, we updated our News Feed ranking to help people see more of the videos they care about and also began testing new options for video monetization to help our partners build their businesses.
And when it comes to serving businesses on our platform, this quarter, we continued to focus on delivering more useful tools and resources to help them achieve their goals.
With Instagram, the continued growth in the size and engagement of the community shows how this is becoming one of the best places to get a real-time snapshot of the world.
On Messenger, this quarter, we rolled out a number of new features, including mobile video calling, a new way to share locations and the option to sign up for Messenger without using a Facebook account.
We expect these improvements to continue making Messenger a more useful and engaging experience for lots of people.
We're staying focused on our three main priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of Facebook marketers and making our ads more relevant and effective.
Better, more engaging and relevant ads are good for people and marketers, and we're working hard to improve them.
As we ramp Instagram ads, we remain focused on quality and relevance to ensure the best experience for people and the highest performance for marketers.
That MAU number grew by 173 million year-over-year, and by this measure the second quarter was our strongest in terms of community growth since 2013.
And everyone has friends and family and wants to stay connected and uses a variety of tools and ways to do that in the world today, which are often very inefficient, and the Internet offers new opportunities to make that a lot better.
And I think a lot of the success that we've seen has been because of some of the work that we've done a few years back at this point in products like News Feed and I mean that team has executed really well.
I mean, there's always a richer way that people want to share and consume thoughts and ideas and I think that immersive 3D content is the obvious next thing after video.
So if you look at what the initial use cases are going to be around that, I think it's a lot of the stuff that you hear people talking about.
That said, and it's important to understand this, while we think there's a lot of interest and great opportunity, we're going to be really thoughtful and strategic about how we ramp revenue.
Instagram remains small relative to Facebook and it's going to really take time to have significant impact on our growth.
I just wanted to ask a little bit more about as you start to speak with more advertisers on the Instagram opportunity, how are you and they thinking about the differences in how they'll engage with their customers across both platforms?
And I guess what I'm getting at is do you see Instagram targeting a different type of advertiser, or do you expect people to leverage both platforms and almost think of them as kind of separate areas to budget for?
I think one of the things that's interesting about Instagram is while the ads are really visually appealing and that brings to mind certain verticals like fashion or autos, things where the visual really matters, what we're seeing is that lots of different verticals can use the platform really well.
In terms of Instagram and Facebook, we believe that marketers are looking to connect with people in a really deep way, connect with the right people, and our targeting we think is really strong compared to any other platform, at the right time.
And we see such engagement on both Facebook and Instagram along with the different targeting and ad formats, we believe we'll be able to have and are already starting to have a relationship with marketers which grow across both platforms.
Well, I think in terms of engagement the product is having, the biggest impact is News Feed continuing to do very well.
As people spend more time with News Feed, we get better about understanding what they like and getting the content that they care about in front of them.
So the playbook that we're going to run with Messenger and WhatsApp is kind of similar to how we thought about building a business in Facebook and News Feed, where if you go back to 2006 and 2007, there were a lot of people who were kind of encouraging us to just put banner ads and kind of inorganic content into the experience, and what we decided was that over the long term, the ads and monetization would perform better if there was an organic interaction between people using the product and businesses.
That we think is driving a lot of value and good content for people who are using the platform and helping a lot of businesses find customers and sell their products and grow overall.
We're working on a lot of different things that make it so that people can get value from interacting with businesses.
We have a number of other things that we're working on across Messenger and WhatsApp. But the long term bet is that by enabling people to have good organic interactions with businesses, that will end up being a massive multiplier on the value of the monetization down the road when we work on that and really focus on that in a bigger way.
And then on Instagram, just a question on kind of how we should be thinking about the ramp as well as the long term opportunity.
And again, we're going to continue to focus on the user experience, focus on the community growth and monetization will follow.
Yeah, and in terms of Instagram, I just think Kevin and the team are doing amazing work.
But I mean, the team has just done really good work in terms of ranking the content and making the experience faster and building out better ways to get feedback from our community on what kinds of content they want to see in News Feed and helping people have the tools that they need to share the social content and news and video content that they want so that way it exists in the corpus of content that can be shown.
We're excited by what we see in the e-commerce vertical and we're going to continue to invest in growing that vertical as part of our ads business.
Joining me today to talk about our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements.
Several products in the Facebook app are reaching global scale, too, now with more than 450 million people using Events each month and more than 850 million people using Groups.
Facebook has clearly become the home for global conversations about things that people care about.
Helping marketers to tell more visually engaging stories through video and carousel ads is an important focus, as well as supporting small businesses.
This quarter, we made some big improvements to the app, including upgrading our search and explore functionality and introducing trending content, which we expect will provide even more engaging experiences.
More than 700 million people now use Messenger and we've reached more than $1 billion downloads on Android.
After launching free basic services, mobile operators are seeing people adopt mobile data 50% faster than before.
We recently made changes to the Internet.org program for both developers and operators that will give more people access to even more free services.
The team recently introduced details about the full hardware and software experience that people can expect, including our new touch controllers.
I got to hear firsthand how advertising on Facebook is helping SMBs sell their products, grow their businesses, hire new employees and even expand to other cities and countries.
Using Facebook as her only marketing channel, Kelly grew her business, Krista Lee Fashion, (11:59) to over ÃÂ£3 million pounds annually and she now has 10 employees.
We're increasing our engagement with the global SMB community and have now held more than 80 local Boost Your Business events around the world, meeting thousands of businesses and getting their feedback on how we can make our products work better for them.
We also introduced a new ad format called Lead Ads, a simpler way for people to connect with companies they're interested in hearing from.
Booking.com, a Priceline Group company, is using Facebook link ads featuring Book Now button to drive reservations.
They're now expanding their use of Facebook ads across multiple markets.
Since we introduced conversion lift, which measures the direct impact that Facebook ads have on sales, we've seen adoption for marketers across verticals.
Using conversion lift, they proved that Facebook ads directly drove vehicle sales.
Entertainment company Live Nation knew that people browsed for concert tickets on mobile devices, but they were never able to measure whether they converted into sales.
This daily number represents 65% of the 1.49 billion people who used Facebook during the month of June.
Non-GAAP expense growth was primarily driven by increases in head count-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses.
Your first question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Securities.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc. I'm just wondering if there's a framework that you used to think about how much of that success is due to just the core value proposition of Facebook itself continuing to resonate with people at its most basic level as opposed to the product innovation that you've detailed in your prepared remarks or in your use cases?
Mark, I think you mentioned potentially some new options for video monetization.
I guess the question would be in your tests, have you noticed any meaningful difference in Instagram users' willingness to see or interact with ads and their News Feed as compared with an average Facebook user, recognizing that probably Instagram's audience is more geared toward some of the developing markets in the U.S. relative to Facebook?
Your next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
And you heard on this call me give a few examples of where we're already able to connect what happens in terms of ads with real sales of real products.
And you heard my Live Nation example earlier where we are able to connect Facebook ads and our platform directly to ticket sales.
So e-commerce is one of our top categories of advertisers, and we are already driving a lot of product sales through Facebook but importantly, our e-commerce initiatives are really about connecting consumers with marketers so that they can buy from companies.
When you think about mobile app install ads, those are an important but relatively small part of our revenue.

facebook,q3,2015,"Joining me today to talk about our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
1.39 billion people now use Facebook on mobile devices, including more than 1 billion on Android.
50 million people also use Facebook Lite, our app for people on low bandwidth connections and one of our fastest-growing interfaces.
This is a great sign for how our mobile strategy continues to make progress across markets, devices and platforms.
This quarter, total revenue reached $4.5 billion and advertising revenue grew by 45% from a year ago.
Another way we're working to improve people's experiences on Facebook is by helping them to share many different types of content with different groups of people they care about.
On average, there are now more than 8 billion daily video views on Facebook and more than 500 million people who are watching daily.
To offer even more engaging video experiences, we've added live video to our Mentions app for public figures, and we now support interactive 360 videos in News Feed.
More than 80 million photos are now shared on Instagram every day, and the pace of adoption among public figures, organizations and people around the world continues to grow really well.
One example is M, a digital assistant we introduced this quarter that over time will use AI to help people complete tasks.
As we rolled out the program, we've made a number of improvements based on feedback from communities and partners, including opening up our platform for free basic services to all developers who want to build.
Meanwhile, our work on new technologies to connect people in the most remote regions continues to make progress.
Facebook Pages are already the mobile solution for millions of businesses.
Instagram ads are now available in all countries where we offer Facebook ads, and marketers can manage campaigns across both platforms with the same targeting.
Video on Facebook gives marketers not just mass reach, but better cross-device targeting and measurement than we believe is available on any other platform.
Over 1.5 million small businesses posted video, which includes organic video posts and video ads on Facebook in the month of September alone.
We recently introduced target rating point, TRP, buying so that marketers can plan, buy and measure video ads on Facebook the same way they do on TV.
Products like carousel ads and dynamic product ads help improve effectiveness for marketers.
I want to take a moment to thank our clients around the world for their continued partnership and congratulate our global Facebook teams on great execution.
Echoing Mark and Sheryl's comments, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook.
This daily number represents 65% of the 1.55 billion people who used Facebook during the month of September.
In September, approximately 1.39 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, up 23% from last year.
These factors will have a less significant impact on the reported price-volume metrics going forward now that a full year has elapsed since the redesign of right-hand column ads, and now that mobile impressions have grown to become the majority of impressions.
Just to share one example, American Express working with Digitas, rolled out carousel ads on Instagram that targeted travel-related interest groups for people who are 18 years and older.
So what we're actually seeing is that a lot of the best or at least from my perspective, TV shows that we see folks like Jimmy Fallon breaking up their show into clips that they can now share to be consumed over social media and on the Internet in three-minute to five-minute or seven-minute segments which are more of what people want when browsing through News Feed.
The current market of trying to help people share and experience all these shorter form clips is massive.
Mark, can you talk a little about what factors and metrics you consider when you're thinking about a multi-app strategy versus rolling out more products and offerings on Facebook?
Just as Mark said with Groups, Events are growing quickly on Facebook.
So the follow-up question that I would have is how do you think you could best partner with the media providers and convince them the merits of bringing their valuable, in some cases expensive, content into the Facebook world, particularly at a time in media when they're really trying hard to guard their own existing ecosystems?
We're working hard in the direct response area, rolling out things like carousel ads and dynamic product ads.
On video, yeah, right now the strength in our system is definitely through helping people discover content that they hadn't really asked for through News Feed.
So I guess the question is, what kind of lift in ROI and overall budget do you see as e-commerce or travel marketers migrate from your first few products, like custom audiences and other to DPA?
And are the yields that you're getting from DPA ads higher than other formats like video and app downloads and those types of things?
The final question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Over the next few years, video is going to be some of the most engaging content online, and by continuing to innovate here, we have a chance to build the best place to watch and share videos.
This quarter, we continued to focus on helping marketers achieve results while using our ad product, including video and carousel ads as well as on Instagram, and as usual, Sheryl is going to talk more about this in a moment.
I just want to thank the entire Facebook community, our employees, our partners and our shareholders for helping us to continue moving forward.
Our results show that we continue to make progress on our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
With more than 45 million active SMB Pages on Facebook, we think there's a lot of opportunity to turn even more of these businesses into marketers.
Marketers come to Facebook and Instagram because we have the best performing mobile ad products, and video is making them even better.
Looking forward, we're going to stay focused on our priorities to continue to build a solid foundation for our long-term business.
We remain focused on growing the number of people who use our services, increasing advertiser demand and improving the quality and relevance of our ads.
We are pleased with the growth and engagement of our community and the momentum in our business, which together support our ability to continue investing to build our next generation of services and execute on our mission of connecting the world.
Once we start getting a bit further along with that, then the next thing that we think is going to be huge is video and immersive experiences, both things that people can create, like the social content that they share on Facebook today, and more professional and premium content both short form and longer form.
Then when they're starting to get to be more units, just like every other major computing platform before that, what we expect is that a large portion of what people do in it will be communication and social behavior, and that's where Facebook really has the DNA and experience to, I think, build the best experiences.
So Instagram ads, now that we've rolled out as we have this past quarter and gotten to a really good product offering, combined the creative format of Instagram which is very visually compelling and has a lot of engagement from people with the back-end infrastructure and marketer base that Facebook has.
On ad load, we have a lot of experience rolling out ads into feed-based products and we monitor it very carefully and we're going to continue to monitor really carefully.
And so, for us, what we really want is people to experiment and learn and get to experience Instagram as they have on Facebook so that we can make the case that we can improve the ROI and then we believe if you look at the consumer metrics of where people were spending their time, we will be able to gain share compared to almost anything else you can buy out there.
But some of Ã¢ÂÂ the vast majority of the content that's consumed on Facebook just talking about video right now is people browsing through feed.
Because there are a lot of really big and important Chinese companies who sell a lot of products to people outside of China, and they use Facebook as one of their primary tools in a lot of cases to spread information about what they're doing and grow their customer base.
In the medium-term, we're focused on those next generation of services, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. And in the long-term, we've got the investments we're making and things like artificial intelligence, VR, and obviously the Internet.org efforts that Mark just spoke about.
So one of the big opportunities that I'm really excited about right now is I think that there's a pretty big opening between very private messaging, the one-on-one messaging products like Messenger and WhatsApp, and products like Facebook where you share with all your friends at once or Instagram.
And in between there, what we're seeing is this huge growth of private groups, right, and Groups remains one of the I think least talked about products on Facebook.
And the amount that people want to share and communicate is boundless and that's I think partially why we're seeing the growth that we are with so many of these products.
1.5 million SMBs have not posted or created video on any other platform, but with us it's cheap, it's very easy to use and that gives us a way to continue to work with SMBs and increasingly grow our business with them.
Looking forward, we continue to feel like there are good opportunities to grow the business.
But it's important to keep in mind that there are a few different reasons why people share content on Facebook, and that's just one of the use cases, right?
So that's certainly been helpful in terms of making News Feed even more engaging and we'll continue to be focusing on a number of initiatives, public content and just sharing with your friends.
When you look at ad quality, I think when Facebook started, Sheryl, you were really adamant that you were focused on improving the ad quality and really making sure you were serving the highest quality ad to the right person.
The quality is really important to us because your experience on Facebook or Instagram is about the quality of what you see, both in terms of the organic posts you see from your friends or public people you're following and the ads as well.
And a lot of, I think, what we need to do is give people a way to see all of the videos that page that they like or follow is interested in sharing on Facebook.
The next big use case that we've really been working on for a couple of years now and I think is going to Ã¢ÂÂ is starting to roll out and is growing quickly is people finding content on Facebook.
So I think that that's going to be a really big deal for improving the experience of reading news on Facebook and it's something that we've been working on for a while, and I'm very excited about it.
So, yeah, I would expect that we will see an expansion of sharing and consumption of all of the different types of things that you asked about: news, video, search and the different experiences there, and these are some of the big areas that we're investing in and they're long-term investments and they're big investments and we're going to keep on pushing on them, but I think that's what we need to do to serve our community well and ultimately connect everyone in the world.

facebook,q4,2015,"Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
More than 1.59 billion people now use Facebook each month and 1.04 billion every day, a growth of nearly 200 million people monthly and a 148 million people daily this year.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve continued to make progress and now 100 million hours of video are watched daily on Facebook.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been testing new experiences like suggested videos which enables people to discover more videos they might be interested in.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre also exploring ways to give people a dedicated place on Facebook for when they just want to watch videos.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve improved Facebook Lite to offer better experience in low-bandwidth environments, improving load times and adding features like video.
More than 50 million small businesses now use pages on Facebook and people post more than 2.5 billion comments on these pages each month.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve also worked to develop new experiences to give people more options for creating and sharing different types of content.
More than 800 million people now use Messenger monthly and in 2015 we grew that number by almost a quarter of 1 billion while also increasing engagement.
We continue to give people new ways to communicate by introducing video calling and new options for customizing conversations with fun things like colors and emojis and by using apps like -- using apps, the Messenger platform.
We think this is an important step towards creating and even more ubiquitous product without affecting our plans for building WhatsApp into important business in the coming years.
Finally, letÃ¢ÂÂs talk about our work on new breakthrough technologies that can help connect more people to the internet and create transformative new experiences.
To share just a few other product examples, in emerging markets we launched Slideshow a video like ad experience that works with lower connection speeds and feature phones.
We introduced local awareness ads globally to help brick and mortar businesses reach people near their stores and started testing Canvas ads to help marketers showcase their products in a more immersive way.
Our measurement tools like Conversion Lift and the Facebook pixel prove to marketers that weÃ¢ÂÂre driving business results and help make our ads more relevant.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan.
And we started some early small tests around f8 last year where with some ecommerce services made it so that people who were buying things could follow up with the business and get customer support and buy more things.
Just wondering how the business is trending thus far in the quarter or maybe by market U.S., Europe Asia-Pacific and Rest of World; and generally, just how Facebook is positioned if the global macro environment softens a bit?
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs the initial marketer folks who we think are going to be most interested from the early VR experiences, especially at some of the higher price points.
We believe both Facebook and Instagram have this combination of an ability to do great creative with the best targeting in a most sophisticated measurement which shows businesses how we help them move products off shelves.
So, the way we need to drive sales around the world is by understanding markets, launching things like click to missed call ads in India and making sure our products work for market but also being able to connect to those advertising metrics and business metrics around the world.
The good news is that weÃ¢ÂÂre getting great results like the Halo 5 example I shared in my remarks that when people are willing to experiment, this is a pretty unique canvas.
First, I know a year ago you gave us usage update and time spent, wondering if video or any other products are having a big impact on usage and if you can give us any metrics there.
IÃ¢ÂÂm just wondering if you think Facebook could monetize better than other forms of media based on time spent or maybe a little bit below.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve done a bunch of work with Nielsen to measure what happens when marketers do big TV campaigns and do campaigns that are broadly, broadly targeted on Facebook.
So for the most part when people are doing big campaigns, theyÃ¢ÂÂre doing them across multiple platforms and we think that will continue.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs for Mark or Sheryl, IÃ¢ÂÂm wondering what is your strategy for professional video content going forward.
What weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing is that users are generating a lot of really high quality content, often pretty short form that people are really happy to consume.
And I wonder if youÃ¢ÂÂve had that same had conversation with your engineers when you think about these two messaging platforms that you have that got a large number of users and clearly globally weÃ¢ÂÂve seen this massive shift of the words messaging, the interest is changed now, people have engaged with it.
Operator, it looks like we have time for one last question.
But itÃ¢ÂÂs important to consider not just our business results but also how weÃ¢ÂÂre improving the lives of people and communities around the world.
In 2016 and beyond, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue doing that by serving our community, working to bring connectivity to billions of people whoÃ¢ÂÂre not yet connected, and building new technologies that give people more ways to express themselves.
Now, letÃ¢ÂÂs talk about how weÃ¢ÂÂve continued working to do that and letÃ¢ÂÂs start with how weÃ¢ÂÂre improving our existing products and businesses.
Video is an important part of the Facebook experience, and continuing to invest here is important for allowing people to share and consume some of the most engaging content.
With other parts of our core, weÃ¢ÂÂve continued to focus on improving the performance and quality of our products to better serve different communities on Facebook.
And when it comes to serving businesses, weÃ¢ÂÂve continued to focus on creating better ads and tools for our more than 2.5 million active advertisers.
Later this year, weÃ¢ÂÂll be testing new ways for people to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organizations that they want to hear from.
So, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue investing to deliver more great results over the long-term.
And thatÃ¢ÂÂs what I think about every day as we continue building Facebook.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre also pleased with the growth weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in emerging markets and countries like China where businesses are advertising on Facebook and Instagram to reach people internationally.
We continue to make progress on our three priorities, capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
With over 1.44 billion people using Facebook on mobile monthly and over 400 million monthly actives on Instagram, Facebook and Instagram have become the two most important mobile advertising platforms.
So we see a big opportunity to continue to grow the number of Facebook advertisers going forward.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre also very pleased with the growth in advertiser adoption of Instagram and the positive results advertisers are seeing from their investments.
In the full year 2015, capital expenditures were $2.5 billion as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure, and office facilities to support the rapid growth of the business.
Our performance reflects the strong growth and engagement of our community, the momentum weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in our ads business, and significant progress weÃ¢ÂÂre making on our mission to connect the world.
First Mark, just on Messenger and WhatsApp, can you just talk more about the takeaway on the Messenger platform now that itÃ¢ÂÂs been open for nearly a year to developers and how thatÃ¢ÂÂs informed your view on what youÃ¢ÂÂre going to do with WhatsApp going forward?
WeÃ¢ÂÂre seeing more and more advertisers move to mobile; they realize that itÃ¢ÂÂs no longer question of whether they need to be on mobile, but itÃ¢ÂÂs really how theyÃ¢ÂÂre going to be on mobile, and we think weÃ¢ÂÂve got the best solution for that and weÃ¢ÂÂre investing to make it even better.
But overall, I mean the reason why weÃ¢ÂÂre interested in this as the social company is that we think that this is going to be a new way that people interact.
And giving a focused experience for the person who wants to run their business through Facebook and be communicating with their customers all day long, thatÃ¢ÂÂs just proven to be an incredibly engaging experience that drives content into the system and is good overall.
We have introduced a number of things like that for public figures, for groups, messengers, probably been the most successful; itÃ¢ÂÂs something thatÃ¢ÂÂs connected to the Facebook experience that now has more than 800 million people using it.
In terms of monetizing time spent, itÃ¢ÂÂs certainly the case that consumers have shifted to mobile and businesses need to catch up.
The exact [ph] percentage we can monetize that weÃ¢ÂÂll see, but we certainly think that we will continue to benefit from the consumer shift to mobile, because businesses are behind.
And we think that thatÃ¢ÂÂs just really important to the mission of the company and weÃ¢ÂÂll increasing engagement and sharing and openness, and all of the things that we care about.
Two questions, Sheryl, could you just talk about political advertising and how you think about the attractiveness of -- and any anecdotes you have on Facebook as a platform for political campaign?
In terms of the election, itÃ¢ÂÂs important to note that weÃ¢ÂÂre large and diversified, so no one vertical drives our business.
So there was a long time where people thought that our business might not be as good because we had no ads on mobile, and that was because we always prioritized the experience for people above, even if itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a painful thing for the company.
First, you build a great consumer experience that helps people share in a new way thatÃ¢ÂÂs really important.
And thatÃ¢ÂÂs how we think about stuff and weÃ¢ÂÂll do that in all of our products and the different things that we do going forward.
",50.7,0.94331914
facebook,q1,2016,"A lot of what we're building today in areas like connectivity, artificial intelligence, and virtual and augmented reality may not pay off for years, but they're important to our mission of connecting the world.
Over the next three years, we're going to keep investing in our most developed ecosystem, the Facebook app and platform.
Today, people around the world spend on average more than 50 minutes a day using Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet.
Our team has just worked day after day on lots of improvements over a long period of time, and that progress continued in the first quarter.
We launched Reactions to help people express themselves in more ways, and we improved our products to work on different mobile networks and devices all over the world.
Over the next five years, we're going to build ecosystems around our products that are already being used by a lot of people.
And to get there, we're building technology that brings people together and that helps everyone in the world share anything they want with anyone.
We're pleased with the progress we made in Q1 across our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
On the supply side, we continue to see healthy growth in the number of people using Facebook, time spent across our products, and ad loads.
Our results reflect healthy growth and engagement in our community, strength in our ads business, and investments we're making to capitalize on the long-term opportunities we see ahead.
I wanted to come back to your comments on the small and medium-sized business opportunity at Facebook, maybe direct a few points to Sheryl to get some comment.
I wanted to understand what some of the opportunities are to continue to demonstrate to those advertisers what the potential is for both Facebook and maybe even Instagram and Facebook Messenger long term as platforms to grow their businesses and also pointing out what some of the measurement tools and operating challenges are to bring people onto the platform.
We then work on helping them use our ad products and upsell them to our paid ad products as well, and we announced this quarter that we hit 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and 200,000 on Instagram.
And that enables people to use Facebook in a very direct to response way, and we'll continue to invest there.
And then the next step is to create organic activity around public entities, so whether that's businesses, public figures like athletes and celebrities and types of folks that people want to interact with on these different platforms, and we did that on Facebook in News Feed group pages, and we're working on a number of different ways to do that in Messenger.
So that's one way that I think you're going to see bots work, between people who are actually driving the businesses directly will need to in some way train or answer questions for people, but we can build artificial intelligence that can learn from people how to automate a lot of that and make that experience a lot faster for people who want to interact with businesses and public figures.
The APAC question, it has been growing really well for several quarters now, and we're seeing a lot of great adoption as people learn to use the products.
And that's our job, is to make it so that we build great tools that people Ã¢ÂÂ everyone around the world can share anything that they want with everyone.
Now the other thing that's also true is that people want to share with lots of different kinds of audiences.
But we're also investing in things like Messenger and WhatsApp because a lot of people want to share increasingly messages privately one on one or with very small groups.
So in addition to Messenger, which is at 900 million people a month, and WhatsApp, which is at more than 1 billion people a month, Facebook Groups is also at more than 1 billion people a month, which I think represents the increasing diversity of the different types of audiences that people want to share with.
Over time, we would expect that ad load growth will be a less significant factor driving overall revenue growth, but we remain confident that we've got opportunities to continue to grow supply through the continued growth in people and engagement on Facebook as well as on our other apps such as Instagram.
And what we look at are what are the things that we think are going to be ubiquitous tools, and who are the most talented people in the world to build this.
We think we're uniquely placed to bring people-based marketing to scale and solve the measurement problem, and the Audience Network is a place we're really focused because we feel like we're delivering value for advertisers and publishers, so we're investing behind the growth we've seen.
So what we're seeing is the results we're able to deliver on Facebook and Instagram, a lot of our marketing partners want more.
One obvious thing I think over time is if you just look at the way that we rank News Feed, today we use some basic signals like who you're friends with and what pages you like as some of the most important things for figuring out what Ã¢ÂÂ out of all of the millions and millions of pieces of content that are on Facebook, what we're going to show and what are going to be the most interesting things to you.
Our focus, however, continues to be on our ad products because we think we can take people all the way from the top of the funnel, where they can really get a brand awareness or product awareness, and go all the way down to purchase, not necessarily because the purchase is happening on Facebook, but because we can work on the measurement systems to understand how the advertising, both at the top and lower down in the funnel is influencing those purchases.
And on Live video, the theme that I think is most important is just that there's so much that people want to express and share with the people around them that they don't have the tools to do today.
I also think that there are going to be a lot more interactive forms of video than just Live and 360 like we're talking about now.
So we're very excited about continuing to do our work to help unlock all the expression and connection that people want to do.
Thank you, good afternoon and welcome to Facebook's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements.
Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
In recent weeks, we're also consistently seeing more than 1 billion people using Facebook on mobile every day.
But because we were a controlled company, we were able to focus on improving the user and product experience of our apps first and then build a strong mobile business over time rather than being forced to do something shortsighted.
And over the years, our structure has helped us make big bets on acquisitions like Instagram that were very controversial initially but were good decisions for our community and our business.
While helping to connect the world will always be the most important thing that I do, there are more global challenges that I also feel a responsibility to help solve to create a better world for my daughter and all future generations, things like: helping to cure all disease by the end of the century; upgrading our education system so it's personalized for each student; and protecting our environment from climate change.
That's why Priscilla and I created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed to give 99% of our Facebook shares to advance human potential and promote equality.
In December, I also announced that I won't sell more than $1 billion worth of stock Ã¢ÂÂ Facebook shares per year over the next three years.
Sheryl will talk more about this in a minute, but now more than 3 million businesses are using our advertising products every month.
Between Messenger and WhatsApp, people send around 60 billion messages every day, and that's almost three times as many messages as SMS handled at its peak.
We hear from marketers that figuring out mobile today is like figuring out TV in its early days.
People are sharing and creating nearly three times more video on Facebook than they were a year ago.
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently on mobile feed than on TV.
For example, NestlÃÂ© took their TV ad for Natural Bliss coffee creamer and in less than a day edited it for mobile feed by creating a new opening and adding text overlays to relay their message without sound.
The ads were so engaging that people spent an average of 28 seconds interacting with them, and Lowe's saw a 6.7 times return on AdSense.
Last year we introduced Conversion Lift to measure how Facebook and Instagram campaigns drive business objectives like sales.
They found that combining Facebook video ads with their TV ads drove 1.5 times more conversions than TV ads alone.
Over 1.5 billion people accessed Facebook for mobile devices in March, up 21% from last year.
Mobile ad revenue grew 75%, driven by strength from Facebook's News Feed.
Importantly, as part of this proposal, the preservation of the multi-class capital structure would be generally predicated on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook.
Mark, I was hoping you could talk to us about how you expect to shift user behavior within Messenger to get users to focus more on businesses versus more personal communications and how you'll make users aware of the capabilities within the platform.
Facebook and Instagram are the two most important mobile ad platforms out there.
Thanks, a question for Mark.
On the question regarding what would happen to Mark's shares if he were to leave Facebook, I'd just refer that the new multi-class capital structure is generally dependent on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook.
At the same time, we also think that there are going to be many, many good businesses and different other social use cases where there are people doing good work and building different companies that we feel no need to own those things.
We have some great examples of Audience Networks really improving people's results.
I'll share one example of how ads are driving a small business on Facebook through ads, which is a company called Sparkle in Pink.
Great, so I guess a question for Mark or Sheryl.
And then the second question on messaging, so with WhatsApp crossing 1 billion users recently, how do you view the product roadmap today on WhatsApp versus what you showcased recently with Messenger?
Bots, very early but giving the opportunity for more personal interactions between businesses and mobile.
The 10 received APIs (56:26), so that businesses could send immediate responses to common questions, including engaging images and call to action as well as texts.
Operator, we have time for one last question.
",57.64,0.88600194
facebook,q2,2016,"At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Facebook Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call.
We're making good progress on core services within the Facebook app, like search.
Continuous steady improvement in services like search are an important part of helping people connect and realizing our mission.
In the two years since we separated Messenger from the main Facebook app, which was a pretty controversial decision at the time, we've improved performance and given people new ways to express themselves.
As of the second quarter, more than 1 million people a month are now using Oculus on mobile phones through our Gear VR partnership with Samsung.
Over 80% of new advertisers in Q2 started with simplified products like boosted posts.
Our goal is to help our clients grow their businesses, whether it be moving products off shelves, driving online sales or building their brands.
Businesses that want to build their brands need to reach a large audience with a compelling story, and they're seeing strong results from immersive formats like video and Canvas ads.
We introduced lead ads in Q1 to make it easy for people to fill out forms on mobile devices right from News Feed.
Businesses selling products are getting search like ROI from dynamic ads.
Over 300 million people see dynamic ads each month and over 2.5 billion unique products have been uploaded by marketers.
This daily number represents 66% of 1.71 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of June.
Mobile continues to drive our growth, with over 1 billion people accessing Facebook via mobile devices on an average day in June, up 22% compared to last year.
The 49% increase in total ad impressions was driven primarily by growth in ad impressions served in Facebook mobile News Feed where the majority of our ads are shown.
Remember that payments and other fees revenue largely generated from games played on personal computers, which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs. Q2 total expenses were $3.7 billion, up 33%, inclusive of $825 million of share-based compensation related expenses as well as $193 million of amortization of intangible assets.
Consequently, we anticipate lower advertising revenue growth rates in each successive quarter in 2016.
Additionally, we anticipate ad load on Facebook will continue to grow modestly over the next 12 months, and then will be a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017.
We anticipate full year 2016 capital expenditures will be approximately $4.5 billion as we invest to support the rapid growth of our business.
But I guess my question is, if targeting continues to improve along with click-through-rate and then ultimately ROI, why does ad load have to become less of a factor going forward?
Thanks for taking my question today.
But another area that's growing incredibly quickly is private messaging, right, where between Messenger and WhatsApp, I think we're around 60 billion messages a day, which I think is something like three times more than the peak of global SMS traffic.
But as we look forward into 2017, we think it'll be a less significant factor driving inventory growth.
But we still think there's opportunities to drive inventory through user growth and time spent.
Can you talk more about the revenue opportunity of bringing Facebook's targeting tools to other video publishers?
They targeted outdoor enthusiasts then retargeted people who viewed the Instagram videos with Carousel ads on Facebook that highlighted the product features.
Well, I, like everyone else, am enjoying PokÃÂ©mon Go. And the biggest thing that I think we can take away from this as we invest in augmented reality in addition to virtual reality, is that the phone is probably going to be the mainstream consumer platform that a lot of these AR features first become mainstream rather than glasses form factor that people will wear on their face.
Messenger today has 1 billion organic interactions between businesses and consumers each month.
I had two product related questions for Mark.
I would say that it's primarily driven by growth in Facebook mobile News Feed.
Over the next three years, we're focused on continuing to build our community and help people share more of what matters to them.
deliver better experiences for our community and more ways for people to share and more of what they care with anyone they want.
And in the second quarter, time spent per person increased double-digit percentages year-over-year across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet.
We've also emphasized the importance of measurements and value in driving real results for the businesses that use Facebook, and that means helping them create more relevant and engaging ads.
We're already seeing a positive impact in terms of time spent and the amount of content that people are sharing.
We've also introduced our advertising tools on Instagram and we're seeing marketers engage with people in creative and innovative ways.
We continue to focus on our three priorities, capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.
We're excited to bring more relevant video ads to people both on and off Facebook.
This means that advertisers can place video, brand video ads, not just on Facebook and Instagram, but across a network of apps and sites.
These results highlight the continued growth and engagement of our global community and the strength of our ads business as advertisers benefit from our increasingly broad and deep portfolio of targeting, creative and measurement tools.
Since ad load has been one of the important factors in our recent strong period of revenue growth, we expect the rate at which we are able to grow revenue will be impacted accordingly.
In summary, Q2 was another great quarter for Facebook, illustrated by the strong growth and engagement of our global community and continued broad-based strength of our ad business.
We're pleased with the results, and we will continue to invest in order to best position Facebook for our long-term growth opportunities.
When you think about what's happening on video on our platform, we're really excited by the production and consumption of video, and we're seeing the full range from people posting the things in their personal lives.
That said, our primary focus is on short form content, not long form content, and we're pretty excited to see the different forms of content people will create, both to share messages, to create new content and to engage audiences around the world.
We still see the opportunity to grow inventory from the growth of people and engagement on Facebook, as well as our other services like Instagram.
And so I think what you're seeing is that across all of the objectives people have from brand marketers to direct response to SMBs to developers, as our ad products get more sophisticated, our targeting and measurements get better.
They have an increased opportunity to grow, and that's why we think our growth to-date continues to be broad-based.
And we're just going to continue working on giving people the best tools across the spectrum from private to public, and across the spectrum from text-based and simple communication to richer type of media like photos, videos, and then, eventually, more immersive forms like VR.
Yeah, and Justin, in terms of ad load, we've talked about the different factors that go into it, obviously, just in driving the overall business.
One of the big growing use case is that we're investing a lot in is looking up the content in the ecosystem, and that is an area that we're very excited about, which helps people find more content.
But the opportunity to take not just video ads, but other ad formats we have, bring them to the rest of the web and other apps with our ability to target and measure, we think is a big one.
And what we're starting to see is that people are using Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network to drive their objective in a cohesive way.
So that's a really good example of how you can take targeting and the ability to target across Audience Network, Facebook and Instagram and drive people all the way down the funnel.
And one of the big themes that we're talking about here is becoming video first, right, and as people look for richer and richer ways to express themselves just like people in the past just shared a lot of text and photos on Facebook, we think that in the future more of that is going to be video.
And basically what Ã¢ÂÂ the way to think about this is that, even if a lot of your friends come from the same kind of background or have the same political or religious beliefs, if you know a couple of hundred people, there's a good chance that even maybe a small percent, maybe 5% or 10% or 15% of them will have different viewpoints, which means that their perspectives are now going to be shown in your News Feed.
So we don't think it would be a good experience in News Feed, right, because a lot of when people are finding videos on Facebook is you're scrolling through News Feed, you're looking at what story seems interesting to you, which is why we did the auto play videos so that rather than having to take an action, you can just start experiencing the video automatically and continue watching it if it's something that you're interested in.
I think people just would watch a lot less of the organic videos that were posted because of that.
But the important thing to keep in mind on this is we don't really Ã¢ÂÂ we don't need to do pre-roll because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content, you come to look at a feed and putting the ads in between the stories is a much more effective way to do it and better for the user experience.
And if we can make it so that you can have some of those interactions in an automated way where you fire off a text and then just get a response back quickly, but asynchronously so it doesn't take up your full attention, then I think that's going to be a much better experience that people really enjoy and like.
And between that and M, which is kind of our own internal bot that we're building, I think that this is going to be an interesting area to watch and encourage more interaction between people and businesses and messaging.
And part of why I think you see this is that there are just so many different ways that people want to share so many different kinds of content, ranging from text to photo to video, just richer and richer and more immersive content.
And we really believed that, and call it five years, or whatever the period of time that it takes to get there, I think most of what people consume online is going to be video.
On consumption, there are innovations that we've had like auto play in feed, but what's the next version of that, that makes it so that people can have an even more native and default video experience when they're in News Feed, as well as private areas like Messenger and WhatsApp. So I think you're going to see this across all of our apps.
And over the long-term, I think one of the big things that we need to do is see if we can not only make this good for engagement for our partners, but also a really positive business driver for them too.

facebook,q3,2016,"So that's why we're prioritizing putting video first across our family of apps and taking steps to make it even easier for people to express themselves in richer ways.
Instagram Stories is a lightweight way for people to share moments of their day through photos and videos that appear in a slide show format and disappear after 24 hours.
We're already testing this in our main Facebook app with a version that has a camera, directly just one swipe away from News Feed, with creative effects for your photos and videos.
The 2016 Summer Olympics were huge on Facebook, with more than 270 million people creating 1.5 billion interactions.
Workplace is a communications platform that uses features that people know, like News Feed, groups, and messages to help them collaborate and share at work the same way that they do everywhere else.
Mary shared GM's success with Facebook mobile video ads.
In Q2, we announced that over 60 million businesses use our free Facebook Pages product each month.
For businesses operating in areas with weak network connections, we continue to build advertising tools into Facebook Lite, our low bandwidth app, and are making more of them available offline.
In Q3, we introduced tools to help businesses find people around the world who look like their current customers and target the ones most likely to convert.
Businesses can use Dynamic Ads for Retail to show people the products available at their closest location in real time and reach people likely to visit their stores.
This quarter we announced new third-party partnerships with Nielsen DataLogix, Visual IQ, and MarketShare to help our clients measure how Facebook ads drive business results.
In September, 1.18 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 172 million or 17% compared to last year.
Mobile continues to drive our growth, with 1.09 billion people accessing Facebook on mobile on an average day in September, up approximately 197 million or 22% compared to last year.
It is worth noting that desktop ad revenue grew 18%, which is higher than growth rates in recent quarters, and was aided by our efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers on advertising served via web browsers.
The reported increase in price continues to be driven by the ongoing mix shift towards mobile, where we show only higher priced feed ads.
Impression growth was primarily driven by mobile feed ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Payments and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal computers, which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs. Q3 total expenses were $3.9 billion, up 28%.
First on revenue, as I mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect that ad load will play a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017.
With a much smaller contribution from this important factor going forward, we expect to see ad revenue growth rates come down meaningfully.
Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
The first one, the past couple quarters you've given us a metric on the growth in time spent per user across the three big platforms.
Thanks for taking the questions, maybe one for Sheryl and one for Dave.
Just really reiterating what I said last quarter about our expectations on ad load going into mid-2017, it's been one of the key factors in terms of driving growth along with time spent Ã¢ÂÂ user growth and time spent growth and advertiser demand.
Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions.
And maybe a related question would be, FOX Sports and Sports Illustrated are co-producing some original content for Facebook Live.
The next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. This quarter was particularly strong for brand, are really recognizing that they can do big brand buys on our platform like they would do on TV, but make them much more targeted.
The one thing that I would say in terms of making money through Messenger is we're already driving results for businesses by letting them advertise in News Feed to open up threads in Messenger, which is different from the long-term vision that we have here around creating interactions that start in Messenger.
So they look for people that at a certain date have used specific itineraries and then created Dynamic Ads which showed the available cruises and pricing and had a Book Now button.
In the first nine months of this year, 109 million people on Facebook in the U.S. generated over 5.3 billion posts, comments, and likes and shares related to the election.
During the primaries and in September, we also added a Register to Vote link at the top of our Facebook app that we estimate helped more than 2 million people register to vote, some who were registering for the first time.
Over the next 5 years, we're going to keep building ecosystems around products that a lot of people already use every day.
We're making good progress helping businesses and marketers use Instagram in new ways, and Sheryl will talk more about that in a few minutes.
A lot of businesses use WhatsApp already, but we're going to really start working on the second phase in the next year.
While we just launched Marketplace, many millions of people have been buying and selling things in Facebook for-sale groups for a while, and we think this is going to be an important tool going forward.
Over the next 10 years, we're going to continue to invest in the platforms and technologies that will connect more people and more places and allow everyone in the world to have a voice.
We continue to focus on our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
We also have a lot of hard work to do to help our partners around the world use mobile to drive their businesses.
Our results reflected the continued growth in engagement of our community around the world and the strength of our mobile ads business.
We're pleased with the growth in time spent per DAU that we're seeing across the Facebook family of apps.
And that includes the Facebook mobile app, where we saw good year-over-year growth in time spent per DAU.
And then, Dave, as we try to digest some of the comments you made about ad load and revenue as we exit 2016, go to 2017, how should we also be thinking about the mix of ad units as you continue to see more e-commerce and video in the platform?
On local, we think this is a really big opportunity, and you see this in the large base of existing businesses using Facebook and Instagram increasingly.
And so what's happening is that people are really using the Facebook business pages and increasingly the Instagram business profile as their mobile presence, and we think that's what's working.
As the rate of growth in ad loads slows and also as you continue to enhance targeting and as more video advertisers come onto Facebook, would you expect that eCPMs will rise and offset part, if not all, of this impact of the ad loads slowing?
So if you think about what is enabling video to become huge right now, it's that fundamentally the mobile networks are getting to a point where a large enough people around the world can have a good experience watching a video.
If you go back a few years and you tried to load a video in News Feed, it might have to buffer for 30 seconds before you watched it, which wasn't a good enough experience for that to be the primary way that people shared.
And when people are ready and want video to be the primary way that they're sharing and consuming content, we're going to be there ready.
We continue to innovate on the products to make them more effective and make this a great gateway for businesses to come onto Facebook and come into mobile and spend.
A product question for Mark, in trying to Ã¢ÂÂ you're talking about some of these features and making the camera more of a central way of communicating on Facebook.
But just in terms of other features and putting the camera at centerpiece, do you think this is something that's going to be obvious to people in the next year, couple of months?
Same thing on the Messenger side, as I mentioned, these products around my day, it's a similar video medium to Instagram Stories and a similar camera to what we're building in the Facebook app as well.
And then, Sheryl, can you just talk about with video, how you see marketers using Facebook more to complement TV and what it would take to shift dollars over in a bigger way going forward?
That is a new experience that we're building, and building that as part of Facebook is a great way for people to see it and get exposure to it, and we'll see where that goes over time.
So we'll look at all those options, but for now I really think that Video Home is going to be a great experience, and I'm excited to roll that out.
So I mentioned this stat earlier that we have about 33,000 bots that are live in Messenger, including experiences across a range of verticals, from news to e-commerce to local businesses and all kinds of different things, and we're seeing some early progress.
But in the near term, what we've found is that a lot of businesses are creating ads in News Feed that then they can follow up and do transactions with people in Messenger, and I think that's going to be pretty meaningful over the next few years.
They saw a three times increase in their online bookings and I think those kind of results are made possible by more vertical-specific products, and we're going to continue to invest there.
What we basically are trying to do is work on over time adding more and more signals to the News Feed model to help us fully value what people in the community value about the different content that we show them.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. In general, what we want to do is try to understand the content that people are sharing and that's out there for them to see as best as possible.
What we're seeing in pages and marketers on Facebook is they want to both get awareness and drive all the way down to generating transactions, and Marketplace I think is going to help people do that.

facebook,q4,2016,"Good afternoon and welcome to Facebook's fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings conference call.
Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's press release and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.
New Year's Eve was our biggest live moment ever, with more people going live than at any other time since we launched the product.
Instagram Stories reached 150 million daily actives just five months after the launch, and we've added new features like Boomerang and Live into Stories and I'm excited to see that continue to grow.
Last month, we introduced Dynamic Ads for broad audiences to help businesses reach new customers based on their interests on Facebook and online behavior.
1.86 billion people used Facebook during the month of December, up 269 million or 17% compared to last year.
As I have noted before, we focus on GAAP results because stock-based compensation plays an important role in how employees are compensated in our business and industry more broadly, and we view it as a real expense.
Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Curious to be Ã¢ÂÂ hear (24:39) how you think about the core use of Instagram now and how it differs from core Facebook.
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
When we think about the P&L impacts of both monetizing video and investing in video, is there anything we should be thinking about or you want to call out in terms of gross versus net on either the revenue side or the revenue share side that could be leading to mix shift to incremental revenue growth but possibly lower margin revenue coming into the business?
Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen.
May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks for taking my questions.
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Second question, and I know you'll be getting a lot of this over the next two or three months, but just any difference on trends Ã¢ÂÂ Millennials on the platform versus other cohorts or groups?
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
David, I think you just talked about these pretty material increases in MAUs. Could I ask two questions?
Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo Securities.
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Sena from Evercore ISI.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies.
Your next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt from Stifel.
Your last question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura Instinet.
Finally, we're looking for ways to grow the ecosystem of video content on Facebook.
We want people to think of Facebook as a place for interesting and relevant video content from professional creators as well as their friends.
Last year we started to invest in more original video content to help seed the ecosystem, and we're planning to do more in 2017.
If we can help people stay informed and make Facebook a better place to understand what's going on in the world, then we think that's going to make our community stronger and a more positive force for good in the world.
We're going to keep making big investments in VR content, and I'm excited about what's coming in 2017, from new games to more immersive educational experiences.
As I said in our call last quarter, we're going to continue to invest and hire aggressively to help improve our products, but also to build the infrastructure that will help us grow in the future.
We continue to focus on our three priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.
With only a small fraction of the businesses on Facebook and Instagram advertising, we know we have a lot of opportunity and hard work ahead.
2016 was another year of strong, profitable growth, and we continued to invest in building our business for the long term.
Mobile continues to drive our growth, with 1.15 billion people accessing Facebook on mobile on an average day in December, up 212 million or 23% compared to last year.
In Q4, the average price per ad increased 3% and the total number of ad impressions served increased 49%, driven primarily by mobile feed ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Full year 2016 capital expenditures were approximately $4.5 billion, up 78%, as we continue to invest to support the rapid growth of the business around the world.
To conclude, 2016 was a strong year for Facebook in terms of community growth, engagement, product innovation and the growth of our advertising business.
So the biggest change that I think that we're going to see on the consumption in News Feed and in the tab over the next year or two is going to be much more video inventory and content coming in as we work through and make that business model start to really click for a lot of folks.
Over the longer term, I think as that works, people will experiment with longer forms of video as well and all kinds of different things.
And then I think your question was on how the core use case between Facebook and Instagram differs.
Facebook has a mix of text and news and links and visual content like photos and videos.
So all those good and subtle decisions that Kevin has made over the years add up to creating a different kind of community that what we're finding and that's great, is that it's really complementary to what people are doing on Facebook.
And that I think speaks to how you can build these different kinds of communities with different connections in a way that really is creating new value in people's lives.
Sheryl, for you; would love to get a sense of how you think about some of the opportunities and challenges sitting ahead of the business now on monetizing all of the video that's being consumed on Facebook.
And we're seeing a lot of great examples of people using ads in the feed across Instagram and News Feed.
And so we're pretty excited about the opportunity we have in our current business, and we're going to work client by client to get the video format of those ads right, get the targeting to be as good and as deep as it can be and make sure we're measuring all the way through to sales.
And for video search Ã¢ÂÂ search is a big priority and a thing that we're working on across all of the different verticals, not just video but also all the posts on Facebook, all of the content that people are selling in Marketplace, the groups that people are joining and sharing and all the news content.
In terms of the opportunities for price, it's really just continuing to focus on making our ads better targeted, more relevant, improving all the different ways in which we can drive better outcomes for our advertisers and sort of meeting them with the results that they care about and delivering those results.
When you think about ads in Messenger, we right now are really focused on consumer growth and engagement because we know that over time that creates the monetization opportunity.
And then talking Asia, could you just comment, Mark, on China and how you think about it at long-term as a market opportunity and your level of optimism that Facebook can have a material presence in that market in 5 to 10 years?
So as I've said a number of times before, our mission is to connect everyone in the world, and it's hard to do that over the long term if we don't find a way to serve more than a billion people who live in China.
So this is something that we're going to continue engaging in and thinking about, how to move forward on, and long-term it's very important.
Kind of more like Facebook to the Instagram example that we used before, whereas WhatsApp I think is a much more utilitarian experience with a much more stark UI where there's just not as much emphasis on having a lot of different ways to engage.
So we did the experiment that you asked about before around ads and Messenger and different ways that businesses can interact and there's a lot of flexibility around how we can explore there, which is why I think you'll see more of that on the Messenger side than on the WhatsApp side in the near term.
But giving businesses the opportunity to connect in WhatsApp and reach the people that they want and eventually have increasingly, hopefully, transactional interactions I think will be a really useful thing on that platform as well.
Well, I think AI is going to be great for the experience that people have in our community.
So there's an increasing focus on objectionable content, right, and a lot of unfortunate things, right, that people share on Facebook.
So I think it's both going to be Ã¢ÂÂ AI is both going to be great on showing people content that's really good and helping us enforce the community standards that we have to make sure that everyone has a good and fair experience.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So, for the video tab, the goal that we have for the product experience is to make it so that when people want to watch videos or they want to keep up to date on what's going on with their favorite show or what's going on with the public figure that they want to follow, that they can come to Facebook and go to a place knowing that that's going to show them all the content that they're interested in.
I do think that it's going to get a lot stronger once the business model really starts to click here, right?
So having mid-roll ads, we're committed to doing this in a way that's very good on the user experience, but that is going to enable the kind of content that I think is going to take us to the next level.
Wehner - Facebook, Inc. So, Anthony, I can just take the first part of that at least, which is Ã¢ÂÂ look, our focus is on kick-starting the ecosystem here for the video tab that Mark talked about.
",59.98,0.8405573
facebook,q1,2017,"We're going to continue building new tools to keep people safe on our platform.
Over the next year, we'll be adding 3,000 people to our Community Operations team around the world on top of the 4,500 we already have today to review the millions of reports we get every week and to improve the process for doing that quickly.
Next I want to give a quick update on what we're building over our three time horizons, how we're making our core services more useful and engaging right now, how we're building ecosystems around products that a lot of people are already using over the next five years, and how we're investing in the technologies that will give more people a voice and make sharing more immersive over the next 10 years.
We want to give developers the power to build all kinds of AR tools in the camera so more people can experience augmented reality on their phone.
Over the next five years, we're going build ecosystems around our products that a lot of people are already using.
As people share more video, as we explore more things like augmented reality, and as we build more tools to keep our community safe, we're going to keep investing aggressively in the infrastructure that we need to grow and serve our community.
For example, adidas, which is how you pronounce them at their headquarters, and its agency, iProspect, created a video highlighting the innovative future of a Z.N.E. It's still early for this new format, but it's a great example of how we can deliver innovative mobile experiences that work for advertisers and work for people.
We're excited about the growing adoption of our platforms, and we're going to continue to invest in helping businesses and people connect.
I wanted to understand what you're seeing in terms of the development of the community on the user growth side, the engagement side, as well as on the monetization side with respect to breadth of advertisers and ad product evolution, what that means for Instagram's future and how it compares to maybe what you've learned growing the business on the Facebook side over the last couple years.
In terms of the development on the advertising side, we're not specifically breaking out Instagram revenue, as you know, because that's sold through the same Facebook ad interfaces, but we're seeing really good contribution and good growth there.
And I think what that shows is the power of the very sophisticated targeting we offer across our platforms along with really the ability to use very simple tools like a phone to create very sophisticated but visually compelling ads.
Mark, first just on the video strategy, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how that's evolving in terms of the type of content that you're licensing and featuring within the Facebook Video tab, and then if you have any more clarity just on how the economics are going to work there around revenue share and gross margins.
And obviously, we're going to be in an area where we're sharing revenue with content providers, so it's going to have a different margin profile than core Facebook News Feed from an expense profile perspective.
Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Can you just talk about some of the biggest trends you're monitoring and what you're most excited about as you think about ways to monetize Messenger over the next two or three years?
The first thing that we need to do on Messenger and WhatsApp is get a lot of businesses using it organically and build the behavior for people that they reach out to businesses for different things, like customer support or for getting news content, things that may not eventually be the big business use cases but establish the behavior of people interacting not only with their close friends, but also with businesses.
And once we get that to a big base, then there are going to be a lot of opportunities to build a business, and the business will be proportional to the amount of that activity that people want to do organically.
So for a while, our strategy has been to just continue building as good tools as we can because no matter how many people we have on the team, we're never going to be able to look at everything.
On that front, we're focused on building out the best video experiences for our community and growing longer-form content as a priority.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. Yes, we know that measurement is so critical, and we really want to measure core business results and focus on becoming the number one growth driver for our clients.
But there are also going to be all these new kinds of things that we're not even building today that developers will be able to experiment with.
So there are lots of different ways that over time this kind of content is going to both augment existing real-world objects and eventually replace them, which I think is going to be an interesting opportunity.
And do you think longer term the video consumption is going to be in that dedicated tab, or will it stay in the News Feed based on what you're seeing right now?
What people do with News Feed a lot of the time is they have a few free minutes, or you want to sit down for maybe a longer session to see everything that's going on in the world.
I think you're going to start in the future getting people coming to Facebook for the News Feed use case of checking in and people coming with an intent to go to the video tab to watch a specific video.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So I think your basic point is right, that the reason why we started working on Marketplace and the tab around that is because when we were exploring what the biggest use cases were of Groups, we uncovered that a very large number of people, hundreds of millions, use Groups to buy and sell different things.
It's really early both in terms of testing the ads and getting any feedback from users, so people who use Facebook, so we don't have that data to share.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So in terms of experimenting with different content, I think we'll try a number of different things here.
But again, like Dave said before, the goal is going to be creating some anchor content initially that helps people learn that going to the video tab that that's a great destination where they can explore and come to Facebook with the intent to watch the videos that they want.
And then the long-term goal is actually not to be paying for specific content like that, but doing a revenue share model once the whole economy around video on Facebook is built up.
And I think Mark touched on the question of business model here, and our focus really is on revenue share.
Deborah Crawford - Facebook, Inc. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.
My hope is to help more than 1 billion people join meaningful groups to strengthen our social fabric over the next few years.
We're doing this by focusing on three key priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing innovative ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
We also recently announced that over 5 million businesses are actively advertising on Facebook, including more than 1 million in emerging markets.
Marketers can see previews of their ads across Facebook and Instagram before rolling them out and get tips to help drive business results.
Advertisers can now target Dynamic Ads to broad audiences and are seeing great results.
In a recent study Facebook commissioned with Kantar, 30% of mobile shoppers said video is the best way to discover new products.
Collection helps marketers tell stories on mobile by combining creative videos or photos of product images.
Advertisers can now reach over 200 million daily actives on Stories to do everything from building brands to selling products.
This daily number represented 66% of the 1.94 billion people that visited Facebook during the month of March, which was up 282 million or 17% compared to last year.
Our community growth in Q1 was driven by product improvement, internet.org, and ongoing third-party promotional data plans in markets like India.
Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Thanks for taking the question, one for Mark and then perhaps one for Sheryl or Dave.
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.
And we're working hard to help advertisers develop the video creative that really works for mobile because that really makes a really big difference.
To share one of my favorite new examples, Subway working with their agency 360i developed video ads and images for Facebook and Instagram to promote the limited time offer Reuben sandwich.
Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
This last quarter we extended viewability measurement to the Audience Network, added another verification partner, DoubleVerify, for video and display measurement, and introduced our MMM [Marketing Mix Modeling] portal so that we can help people measure across all of the different platforms and compare the effectiveness of their ad spend no matter what their end goal is.
Your next question comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente from Nomura Instinet.
When you think about what really drives great performance for both people who are using Facebook but for marketers, it's well-targeted ads.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC.
Your next question comes from the line Ross Sandler from Barclays.

",61.09,0.56922066
facebook,q2,2017,"Over the next five years, we're going to build ecosystems around products that a lot of people are already using.
We're also working to build a business ecosystem around Messenger and WhatsApp. Messenger and WhatsApp both have large communities, and they're growing quickly, with 1 billion people now using WhatsApp daily.
And we think that this has the potential to be a powerful tool to bring people together and help build community in some new ways.
Given the size and engagement of our audiences, Facebook and Instagram are the best platforms to reach people and drive business results.
More video is being shared and watched on Facebook than ever before, and it's increasingly helping people and businesses connect.
We're working hard to help marketers adopt mobile-first video ad strategies for Facebook and Instagram.
We continue to see strong growth and engagement in our global community as well as momentum in our mobile ads business.
We're also pleased to see strong adoption and community growth across video, Instagram Stories, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Turning now to the financials, all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.
As we have discussed before, we continue to expect that Facebook ad load will play a less significant factor driving advertising revenue growth going forward, and that desktop ad revenue growth rates will slow in the second half of 2017 when we begin to lap efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers.
We also expect that our video content investments will contribute to operating expense growth in the second half of 2017.
We will continue to invest aggressively in the many opportunities we see ahead, as we make progress on our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
Mark, the offerings on the core Facebook app have improved and changed a lot over the years from Groups, Live Video Search, et cetera.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So the main value proposition for the Facebook app is helping people share any type of content that they want with any audience that matters to them.
If you're a business and you have a higher ROI for interacting with a person in your messaging thread than you do on the mobile web or trying to get them to install an app, then that creates this positive feedback loop, where you're going to point your ads towards the Messenger thread.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. So we're really happy that our growth has been really strong across our verticals, and that continues to be the case.
I think the heaviest lifting of the work we do is really helping marketers in different verticals focus on the right metrics, which are the sales metrics, because for too long our industry has been focused on proxy metrics, how long someone viewed a video, even brand lift, measurements we care about, but these are all proxy metrics.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So a lot of the themes around building community and bringing people closer together have been underscored by a lot of the experiences that I've had traveling around.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. And then, Dave, just hoping you can put a finer point on the timing around the reduction in ad load growth.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. I mean, to the first question, we're going to build the services that we think are useful.
And so the work that we have cut out for us is to help marketers and working with their agencies evolve the format of the ads so that they're optimized for mobile, optimized for Facebook, optimized for Instagram.
So we're currently going through the process of figuring out what we want to invest in over the next year and doing our long-range planning, and this is certainly one of the areas where I think we want to be investing a lot more in and believe that there's a big opportunity and can accelerate all the effort.
I do think, as you say, this is one of the rare times in business where you can look at messaging platforms that exist and see how they've successfully monetized in other parts of the world and have that be a floor.
But in a lot of markets around the world, we see that ad quality is increasing at a very fast rate, and that makes it so that a lot of times people do ask for the content, which of course creates a very different dynamic.
But for all the reasons that I've said here around our own experience doing this in other contexts with Facebook and Instagram, proof points in the market of how it's worked, I think over the long term I'm pretty confident that we will get there, and it's our job to just go do that.
Should we consider investment in video content the number two driver of OpEx growth in the back half of the year?
On the Messenger ads, I think the way we think about it is, as Mark said, we have a lot of work to do to work on the format of that.
And so as we work on rolling out more Ad Breaks, and we are rolling out slowly, we're really focused on finding ways to help marketers measure the right things, and that's a very important focus for the company going forward.
And do you see this enabling of great organic interactions, as Mark put it, as a way to ultimately make Messenger a great ad platform, or do you think that enabling these other business services can lead to other monetization opportunities down the road, independent of advertising?
In terms of the bots, what we really think about is our businesses and people making useful connections on both sides on Messenger or any platform.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So, there have been a number of questions about Messenger.
But if there's one message here that I think is actually important to say, it's that we're trying to communicate that the pace of growing the Messenger business, it's a longer-term thing.
I actually think over the next couple of years or few years, the much bigger driver of the business and determinant of how we do is going to be video, not Messenger.
Messenger, I think, is a really important thing and WhatsApp over a three- to five-year period, and we're investing a lot in it.
And I think that those questions around video, which I'm optimistic about, but there are real questions there that we need to manage well, is going to be a much bigger driver of the business over the next two to three years likely even than the trajectory of what we're doing on Messenger and WhatsApp. Look, that's not just happening.
So I think that that's a thing that we take seriously, whether it's connectivity and making sure that people actually all around the world get to enjoy and benefit from the opportunities that the Internet has or the improvements that come from AI, or eventually upgrading the computing platforms that we all get to use.
Meaningful communities on Facebook are groups that quickly become an important part of your social network experience and your real world support structure.
Our goal is to help more than 1 billion people join meaningful communities.
Next, I want to give a quick update on what we're building over our three time horizons: making our existing services more useful now; building new ecosystems over the next five years around our products that a lot of people already use; and creating foundational technologies to achieve our mission over the next ten years.
We've achieved some major milestones, delivered good business results, and set clear goals around building strong communities and bringing people and the world closer together, but we have a long way to go.
Our goal is to build meaningful connections between people and businesses by focusing on our three key priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing innovative ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
Last quarter, I talked about how our Dynamic Ads help retailers and e-commerce companies promote their products across devices.
Dynamic Ads show people the products that are most relevant to them based on actions they've taken, such as viewing items on a company's website.
From driving brand awareness to increasing sales, businesses can now use full-screen Instagram Stories ads for any goal.
Marketers of all sizes are increasingly following our best practices, like optimizing their ads to drive real-world outcomes rather than focusing on proxy metrics such as page likes and video views.
For example, we introduced value optimization, which helps businesses show ads to people who are most likely to spend based on previous purchase behavior.
We also introduced value-based Lookalike Audiences, which use machine learning to help marketers reach people who are similar to their most valuable current customers.
We know that many marketers want to verify and compare results across platforms, and that's why we're focused on giving our clients more options for third-party measurement and verification.
As marketers build more meaningful connections with people on mobile, we help them grow their businesses, which in turn grows ours.
This number represents 66% of the 2.01 billion people that visited Facebook during the month of June, which was up 294 million or 17% compared to last year.
Our community growth was again driven by product improvements on Android, our Internet.org effort, and ongoing third-party promotional data plans in markets like India.
In addition, we expect that our strategic focus on driving engagement with mobile video may slow advertising impression growth, given the relatively fewer ad impressions in video relative to News Feed.
We are ramping our infrastructure investments to support global growth and anticipate more data center building activity in the second half of this year.
Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo.
Sheryl, you guys have rolled out some initiatives designed to address specific advertising categories like Dynamic Travel Ads. Could we anticipate more efforts going forward to address categories that may be relatively underpenetrated by Facebook, Instagram, and Audience Network?
I think two years ago at F8, you talked about WhatsApp user base about really north of 1 billion sending out 50 billion messages a day, and Messenger was about 1 billion and 20 billion messages a day, so implying kind of like 2.5 times the engagement on WhatsApp compared to Messenger.
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

I'm curious how you think that impacts both the consumer product as well as the advertising business.
",54.76,0.7410521
facebook,q3,2017,"Thank you, good afternoon and welcome to Facebook's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.
Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
And even without legislation, we're already moving forward on our own to bring advertising on Facebook to an even higher standard of transparency than ads on TV or other media.
This goes both for sharing, where we've seen Stories in Instagram and Status in WhatsApp grow very quickly, each with more than 300 million daily actives, and also for consuming video content.
Now we're starting to test business features that make it easier for people to make the same kinds of connections with businesses through WhatsApp. We're also seeing good progress with Workplace, helping companies connect their own teams internally through their own versions of Facebook.
We're continuing to build our business by focusing on our same three priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing new ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.
They've grown so much from marketing on Facebook that they've been able to hire 10 new employees this year alone.
Now they sell their grooming products in 38 countries using mobile video ads on Facebook and Instagram.
People and businesses are finding creative new ways to use full-screen vertical video in Stories.
We're also seeing how immersive video and images can help people discover new products on Facebook.
In Q3, we introduced new tools powered by machine learning and automation to help businesses reach people more likely to spend with them.
Duplicate accounts are those that we believe are used by the same person and represent real activity and engagement on Facebook.
Year-to-date capital expenditures were approximately $4.5 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers, office facilities, and network infrastructure.
We continued to invest aggressively across the business, but there are three important factors driving an acceleration in our expense growth rates from 2017 levels.
And then secondly for Sheryl, you made such good progress growing the advertising business across SMB in a lot of verticals.
If you step back, could you talk to any areas or any verticals where you really see the potential for material improvements or verticals you're having a hard time cracking into that you think can really be bigger drivers of ad revenue growth going forward?
And I think that's really what's allowing us to improve yield and effectively driving higher effective CPMs for us while still delivering business outcomes to them at attractive ROIs. It's really about us getting better at targeting and working with especially people where we get those downstream signals like direct response advertisers.
Just going back maybe to the investment and security comments, maybe could you provide a little more detail just on what that investment could look like and how we could think about that showing up in R&D, cost of revs, G&A, or maybe a combination, and then maybe any early thoughts on GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] and potential impact there and maybe some of these transparency efforts if they could have possible benefit?
First, as you've integrated more video content into Facebook, are you seeing better time spent per user?
Whereas when you engage with public content, you might get informed or be entertained, but it's not necessarily increasing social capital in the same way or building relationships between people.
Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Certainly, this quarter we saw that ad load had a much less significant impact on impression growth.
Because I don't think someone like Spielberg is going to work for an ad revenue share, no matter how good that advertising is.
And then when you look at sports, which I also think about as being really relevant content that has a huge community around it, something like the NFL mobile rights I think come up next year.
And we've certainly found on the Internet and YouTube and in other places that there are whole industries around creators with different cost structures than traditional Hollywood folks who can produce very informative and engaging content that a lot of people like and enjoy and that builds communities and that helps people connect together in a way that definitely can be supported by this ad model.
Wehner - Facebook, Inc. And then even after we establish a flywheel here and get content being produced for ad revenue share, that's going have a different margin structure than core News Feed.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. Visa with SocialCode and BBDO created 10-second videos with text overlays showing people making digital payments.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets.
We already have about 10,000 people working on safety and security, and we're planning to double that to 20,000 in the next year to better enforce our community standards and review ads.
And the reason I'm talking about this on our earnings call is that I've directed our teams to invest so much in security on top of the other investments we're making that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward, and I wanted our investors to hear that directly from me.
But as video grows, it's important to remember that Facebook is about bringing people closer together and enabling meaningful social interaction.
So we're going to focus our products on all the ways to build community around the videos that people share and watch.
I want to close by talking about what we're doing to protect our platform and help ensure that the ads and content people see on Facebook and Instagram are legitimate and authentic.
We saw continued growth in engagement in our community as well as strong performance in our ads business.
Maybe revisiting Mark's comments at the beginning of the call, I would love to get a better sense or granularity about what sort of video content you'd like to see on the platform that could drive a more active or interactive experience than passive.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So the strategy here around helping people connect reflects more on what we do around the videos than some of the content itself.
So we're going to continue investing heavily in video content for Watch that is centered around people, that is centered around the things that people want to talk and connect around, that give people a sense of pride and bring people together.
Just, Mark, to go back on your focus on community and video, I was wondering if you could share with us or help us understand what you're seeing in engagement trends or maybe time spent per user on the core Facebook platform, as you've had so many efforts focused on community and video.
I think if you think about where the growth remains, it really is in increasing the relevance of the ads, because the ads I think are getting better in terms of reaching the right people at the right time.
And if you look at the percentage of our ads business where people are using our most sophisticated approaches to finding the right audience, I think we still have a lot of opportunity for growth there, and that will improve both the quality of the ads people see but also the returns to marketers.
And those three factors are the ones that I outlined in my commentary: number one, the substantial investment that Mark highlighted that we're making to just improve the security on our platform; two, the video content investments we're making for Watch tab; and then three, additional investments we're making in the long term initiatives like AR/VR, AI, and connectivity.
But most people who come to News Feed and who come to Facebook today in general are trying figure out Ã¢ÂÂ they're trying to see what's going on with their friends, see what's happening in the world.
Now in order to build that up, we think it makes sense to first invest in a bunch of lighthouse content, some that we may produce or some that we may license, to get to your question.
We just want to start the flywheel going, so that way there's content and communities that are there that support this use case of people coming to Facebook specifically to engage in that.
But first, we need to build this behavior where people want to come intentionally to engage with this content.
So I think you're going to see it impacting across the spectrum of our lines, but overall one of the significant factors driving the acceleration in growth rate.
And we're going to focus a lot more on helping people share videos of their moments in their lives.
And what the research that we found shows is that when you're actually engaging with people and having meaningful connections, that's time well spent, and that's the thing that we want to focus on.
Justin, then your question on ARPU in the U.S., we do think that there are opportunities to continue to grow the business in the U.S. on a lot of different fronts.
And we're going to invest both in people and technology because we think that both are really important parts of the solution here, to go after all different parts of these problems.
Well, I think the answer to that is we don't know all the answers around what kinds of content are going to work and are not, so we will probably experiment with a number of different things.
And what we would like to transition that more to over time and what an increasing amount of the content is, is revenue shares for ads shown in the videos.
I think Ã¢ÂÂ look, today we're talking about the additional investments we're making in terms of the lighthouse content on the Watch tab, so we are putting a substantial investment behind that.
The ability to show something in News Feed and then show a video in Watch and then show something on Instagram and measure results across the full funnel we think are very worthy investments for the long-term health of the business.
So earlier in the year, when we were working on problems like seeing issues when people were going live, there was this really serious issue around people with self-harm and in some cases suicide on Live, and we made an investment in AI tools and in dramatically increasing the staffing of the team that was working on that and brought the amount of time to review those Live videos down through a combination of those things to Ã¢ÂÂ I think it's under 10 minutes now.
So that way, through a combination of the AI tooling that we build and having people to look at these things, we can get it right faster for more of the types of content.
",49.69,0.69708616
facebook,q4,2017,"We've also gotten feedback from our community that these moments that lead us to connect to the unique experience that people want and expect from Facebook.
But in the last couple of years, the ecosystem of public content like video, news, and post from businesses has grown massive to the point where it's starting to crowd out the personal connection that people value most.
So let me be clear, helping people connect is more important than maximizing the time they spend on Facebook.
Now as I made clear announcing these changes, I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down as a result.
For example, changes we made to improve quality in the fourth quarter contributed to a decline in people using Facebook daily in some country.
By focusing on meaningful interactions, I expect the time we all spend on Facebook will be more valuable and I always believe that if we do the right and deliver deeper value, our community in our business will be stronger over the long-term.
But just like the changes we're making that will impact time spent these investments will help us build a stronger community over the long-term.
The growth of Stories will have an impact on how we build products and think about our business, including Whatsapp and Instagram which are the number one and number two most used Stories product in the world.
Beyond the video, we have a long roadmap working to help people connect in meaningful ways.
A new app designed specifically for small and medium businesses to connect with people they want to reach.
We continue to make progress on our three priorities; helping businesses, leverage the power of mobile, developing new ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.
Facebook and Instagram allow people and businesses connect and our especially meaningful platforms for small businesses.
This year, we will visit more than 30 cities in the U.S. and Europe to work side by side with SMBs, start-ups and NGOs. As people and businesses shift to mobile, Instagram continues to grow quickly.
About two-thirds of the visits to Instagram business profiles are from people who don't follow them and this is helping bring in new customers.
For example, we're continuing to invest in value optimization, which helps advertisers show their ads to people who are likely to spend more with them.
As Mark said, 2017 was a challenging and important year for Facebook, a year where we committed to increasing our investment in the safety and security of our community, it was also a strong year for our business where our investments in helping our clients grow payoff.
The biggest focus Ã¢ÂÂ the biggest impact of the focus on meaningful interactions as Mark mentioned will be in areas like passive video, where from a business perspective, we monetize less on a time spent basis.
So if you think about it in terms of things like post views in News Feed, which drives impression growth that we think this will have less of an impact, and so that's sort of built in to what I had said about the business commentary when I commented on 2018 revenue outlook.
When I think about the MSI changes, obviously any change that's beneficial for our community is good for the long run health of our business, because as Mark said, we care not just about time spent on Facebook, but time well spent.
When you think about GDPR, the Facebook family of apps already applies the core principles in GDPR frame, which are transparency and control and we are building on this to make weÃ¢ÂÂre ready to fully comply by May. We're going to continue to give people are personalized experience to be clear about how are using the data and give choices and we realize that this means that some users might opt out of our ads targeting tool.
We also have Ã¢ÂÂ we think the best stability to target and make advertising relevant for businesses and people who see ads.
We're continuing to build the products that allow businesses to get a higher return for the dollars they spend and allow people to see more relevant information in ads on our platform.
What will you be watching for in terms of either the time spent on the platform or the user growth on the platform or relative engagement to say that you've got the mix right and that people are seeing the right of content and have a healthy experience with Facebook over the next couple of years?
So that will first take hold as the series of News Feed changes, but over time there are going to be new products that we build new interfaces that the team is designed with the goal of encouraging interactions between people.
So the thing that we're going to be measuring is basically the number of interactions that people have on the platform and off because of what they're seeing that they report to us is as meaningful.
But we continue to make changes to improve and to optimize around driving meaningful social interactions as Mark talked about.
So we have multiple clients who will show an ad, a video ad to everyone in the U.S. for example or to a big cohort of people and then they'll follow up with an ad that target on either Instagram or Facebook to people who engage with that first that then they can follow up with the next team and we are seeing as businesses are increasingly measuring your ad spend in terms of their real ROI for sales that even within our own platforms.
So you can think of all of this work and Sheryl talked about the value optimization efforts as part of that as being an effort to improve the yield of the impressions that we have to drive downstream business results for advertising partners.
So we're still very optimistic long-term that Watch will be used for video that helps to bring people closer together and that will correlate with all the things that our community is telling us they want and that correlate with the measures of wellbeing that we think that social products can generate by helping people build relationships in terms of all the long-term measures of wellbeing that we care about like long-term happiness and health et cetera.
What we're excited about is that our business is helping people connect with things they want to buy.
And Sheryl talked about value optimization and that sort of work that we're doing, and so I think we've got continued opportunities with e-commerce going forward.
The first and most tactical or just the optimization to everything that you see, right, from ranking in News Feeds, your ranking of ads or search, or improving our security systems, and that's driving a lot of the business and the quality improvement that we're seeing and that's really important.
In the last few months, there have already been more than 100 instances where we've been able to reach out and get in touch with first responders that they can give you people the help that they need, and that's a big structural change in the way that we do business in terms of protecting the security and integrity of our community.
And I do think that that is likely going to continue this trend of decreasing passive consumption, but if we do our jobs well, it should increase the number of meaningful interactions that people have.
I mean we think it'll be good for the business over the long-term, but this is what people are telling us is what they want on the product.
And we think that we can help drive that and improve people's lives by doing that, so we're absolutely going to go do that.
Joining me today to discuss our results are: Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
Giving people a voice who didn't have one before, strengthening relationships by helping family and friends stay connected wherever they are, and enabling more than 70 million small businesses to grow and create jobs.
We've also built new technology to detect suicidal posts that have helped first responders reach more than 100 people who needed help quickly and we've built AI systems to flag suspicious behavior around elections in real time and remove terroristsÃ¢ÂÂ content.
More than 700 million people each month now come to Facebook to buy and sell things.
We launched a plugin for Messengers that people can chat live with companies on their websites, and now more than 2 billion messages are sent between businesses and customers every month.
Our second priority is developing innovative ad products, each year mobile advertising reaches new milestones during the holiday shopping season.
For example, Holiday Inn Express recently used dynamic ads for travel with our collection formats to advertise to people who search for hotels on their website, but hadn't yet booked.
As we expand and improve our ad products advertisers are increasingly developing mobile first ads rather than simply taking their TV creative and putting them online.
We're seeing the short form videos work well and Instagram Stories were people can watch a full-screen vertical video and swipe up to quickly learn about a product or brand.
Facebook give small businesses the same powerful tools that were previously only available to large advertisers.
In addition to rolling out the ad transparency tool in Canada that Mark mentioned, we've disabled the option that less advertisers exclude people and specific multicultural affinity segments until we can develop better safeguards against discrimination.
As Mark mentioned certain product quality changes impacted our DAU growth.

facebook,q1,2018,"But it's clear now we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well, whether that's foreign interference in elections, fake news, hate speech, or app developers and data privacy.
We are doubling our team working on security and content review to more than 20,000 people by the end of this year, and this includes content reviewers with specific language skills to detect hate speech in places like Myanmar.
We've seen people come together after Hurricane Harvey to raise more than $20 million for relief, and we've seen more than 80 million small businesses use Facebook to grow and create jobs.
Last quarter, we shared our well-being research into the good and bad uses of technology that showed that when you use the internet to interact and build relationships that's correlated with greater long-term well-being and greater health and happiness over time.
We continue to work on connectivity and our Internet.org efforts have now helped almost 100 million people get access to the Internet who may not have had it otherwise.
And finally, we have some big moments for virtual reality coming up, and I'm excited to get Oculus Go in people's hands soon.
We surveyed small businesses in 18 countries, and more than half of SMBs on Facebook say they've been able to hire more people due to growth in demand since joining our platform.
After Hurricane Harvey damaged her business last year, she used Facebook to find new customers.
Advertising supported businesses like Facebook equalize access and improve opportunity.
In the coming months, GDPR will give us another opportunity to make sure people fully understand how their information is used by our services.
We continue to make progress on our three priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile; developing new ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective.

So it's an interesting example of how having payments in messaging can increase efficiency for businesses and how in this case that's contributing to our Internet.org and connectivity goals of helping more people access the internet who wouldn't have otherwise been able to.
Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
So on virtual reality here, I think the big picture is that every 10 to 15 years or so there is a major new computing paradigm, right, whether that's DOS and then Windows and kind of desktop UI and then web browsers and now mobile phones and apps.
One of my great regrets in how we've run the company so far is I feel like we didn't get to shape the way that mobile platforms developed as much as would be good because they were developed contemporaneously with Facebook early on, right.
Like, is there other lines of business, other revenue streams that people should be thinking about that create substantial opportunities, and specifically subscription, and then maybe if you could just touch on from a commerce standpoint now that Instagram's starting to be such a big driver of commerce, how do you think about diversifying revenues versus essentially being almost pure advertising?
At the same time, we also have a responsibility to keep moving forward and keep building tools that bring people together in meaningful new ways.
That's why beyond the investments we're making to secure our platform, we're going to invest even more in building the experiences that bring people together on Facebook in the first place.
One of the interesting opportunities and challenges over the coming years will be making sure that ads are as good in Stories as they are in feeds.
Our commitment to you is that we will continue to improve our ads model by strengthening privacy and choice, while giving businesses of all sizes new and better tools to help them grow.
Turning to our outlook, the changes that Mark and Sheryl described will, we believe, benefit our community and our business and will serve to strengthen Facebook overall.
At the highest level, we believe that we can continue to build the great ads business while protecting people's privacy.
We have a lot of work ahead and are investing aggressively to enhance safety, security and privacy, while also focusing on our mission of giving people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
Mark, so you focused on bringing people together and clearly have this massive platform with strong engagement, but can you talk about some of the business opportunities for Facebook on the platform away from advertising, and where you're most focused there?
So even when we do other things, like we're running tests of payments, we have Marketplace which is growing and doing well, there may be other ways that we could think about making money from those, but in general our strategy is to offer those services at cost and make it so that businesses can bid what it is worth to them to run ads in the system.
We think that that is both the most efficient way to run the business, it offers every business in the world the lowest prices that we can potentially offer, and it provides a great free service to people around the world.
I know that a lot of people have had questions about the business model, and this is something that I just think we at Facebook are very proud of.
And we think that it is the right way to build a service that connects everyone around the world.
And then maybe more for Mark, there have been some recent reports that imply that even some seemingly simple things that Facebook may not be proactively identifying or addressing have come up and I guess the question is, is it that it's not as simple as it may seem, or is it that these reports aren't accurate, this just has to do with some of the sensitive data like social security information being showing up online?
So on GDPR, I think fundamentally we believe we can continue to build a great ads business while protecting the privacy of the people who use Facebook.
Mark, in the changes you talked about at the product level at the beginning part of the year, as you've started to make those changes and some of the content people see on the platform has evolved, what does that mean for engagement?
Wanted to know if you'd give us any color about your own conversations on the business side, on the messaging apps, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and how investors should think about the opportunity there.
And that follows a lot of feedback directly from our community that people want Facebook to be more about friends and family and less about just content consumption.
And it also follows the well-being research that we've done that suggests that when people use the Internet for interacting with people and building relationships, that is correlated with all of the positive measures of well-being that you just expect like longer term health and happiness, feeling more connected and less lonely, whereas just passively consuming content is not necessarily positive on those dimensions.
I think that that's the thing that people can uniquely do on Facebook that they can't do on other services that may be more about just consuming content.
So we think that this is going in the direction of building a stronger community and a stronger business over the long term, and we're optimistic about what we're seeing here.
I guess, a second question is, do you think time spent on Facebook can start to grow again?
So we're continuing to invest in that work, and we think it's the right thing for the Facebook community in the long run.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So for Watch, the big thing that we're trying to do is help create new ways that people can connect, right?
And we think that that's the kind of experience that we can uniquely build and that that's going to further our mission and just be a unique thing that we can add to the world.
I'd say it's still pretty early overall in terms of the growth of this, but it's clearly an area that's important where I think we have something unique that we're going to bring to make this successful.
And on the testimony, these are important issues and I think that that was an important moment to be able to go and hear what people were wondering about and just to have a public hearing of answering all of the questions around Cambridge Analytica and what we knew and all the steps that we're taking on data privacy and developers to make sure that this doesn't happen again and to lay out all the different things that we're doing.
Advertisers ask the same questions as people are, that they want to make sure their and their customers' data is protected, and I think we are able to answer those questions in a compelling way.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. When you think about the way people have the choice to restrict data use, I think it would affect the product.
Mark Elliot Zuckerberg - Facebook, Inc. So I think that this is going to be a really big opportunity.
So I think what you're going to start to see are people interacting with pages, maybe follow a page on Facebook or Instagram.
David, could you just try to spell out a little bit more how GDPR could actually impact advertising revenue growth in the future, like, what's the doomsday scenario here?
And I think overall benefits not only the advertisers, but also the people who use Facebook.
When you think about the opportunities for the business broadly, you obviously are crushing it from an advertising standpoint when you look at any measure of growth.
So even if we just convert people who are advertising on Facebook into Instagram, that's a lot of a growth opportunity.
What's I think interesting and strong about our potential business growth is that we're able to do this across these services.
And if your goal is to connect to everyone and make sure that people can all participate, that ads-based model makes a lot of sense and we're going to continue to invest very heavily there.

facebook,q2,2018,"For the first time today, we're also releasing how many people use at least one of our apps, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram or Messenger, and that's 2.5 billion people each month.
I want to start by talking about all the investments we've made over the last six months to improve safety, security and privacy across our services.
And at the same time, it was encouraging to see the vast majority of people affirm that they want us to use context, including from websites they visit, to make their ads more relevant and improve their overall product experience.
Now, in light of increased investment in security, we could choose to decrease our investment in new product areas, but we're not going to, because that wouldn't be the right way to serve our community and because we run this company for the long term not for the next quarter.
Now, perhaps one of the most important things we've done this year to bring people closer together is to shift News Feed to encourage connection with friends and family over passive consumption of content.
Now, there are more than 200 million people that are members of meaningful groups on Facebook, and these are communities that, upon joining, they become the most important part of your Facebook experience and a big part of your real world social infrastructure.
And we're seeing some real traction with some of the original program, from the talk show Red Table Talk, featuring Jada Pinkett Smith, to Skam, an interactive series that started in Norway and features a new style of storytelling where the characters have accounts on Facebook and Instagram, and key parts of the story are told not just through video, but through posts on their pages.
Stories continue to be a big part of the future of sharing too, and they're growing quickly across WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.
While we started off just implementing the basic Stories format, we've now moved well beyond it, and have built lots of new features like polls, questions, and collaborative stories and groups and events.
We've made the most progress here on Instagram, but this quarter, we started testing Stories ads on Facebook too.
More broadly, our strategy is to use Facebook's computing infrastructure, business platforms and security systems to serve people across all of our apps.
As we make these investments in transparency and accountability, we remain focused on our key priorities: helping businesses leverage the power of mobile, developing innovative ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.
We see this trend toward video across all of our apps, from people sharing more video with their friends on Facebook, to watching more video from creators on Instagram, to having more video calls on WhatsApp and Messenger.
Ads in Stories are an immersive engaging way for people to interact with businesses.
This is our best estimate of our de-duplicated audience across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We believe this number better reflects the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of these services.
We plan to grow and promote certain engaging experiences like Stories that currently have lower levels of monetization, and we are also giving people who use our services more choices around data privacy, which may have an impact on our revenue growth.
In addition to increases in core product development and infrastructure, this growth is driven by increasing investment in areas like safety and security, AR/VR, marketing, and content acquisition.
Two. Just the first one on monetization of Facebook core versus Instagram; can you talk a little bit about how you think about monetization levels and the key drivers currently and, going forward, when we think about ad load, pricing and the importance of ad improvements across the two platforms over the next, call it, year or so?
And the second one on Instagram TV, maybe just talk about how you look at Ã¢ÂÂ think about the core consumer offering, how it varies from Facebook Watch and, philosophically, how you think about investing in premium content or sports content across these two products.
In terms of Facebook versus Instagram, they're obviously both contributing to revenue growth.
On the demand side, we see a good traction across both platforms, and we're rolling out more ability for advertisers to leverage ads in Stories with more formats and the like.
With Watch, a lot of what we're trying to do is make it so the video content that's on Facebook and some of the content that we're acquiring through original programming that people can come together with their friends to watch that content through things like Watch Party and engage and build community that way.
Maybe going back to the OpEx and your comments, Dave, looking out sort of medium to longer term, just wanted to understand if we can get a little bit more color on some of the drivers of that.
How much of it could be video in support of where you want to take the business over the medium and long term versus things that maybe don't necessarily have a revenue component to them like the security and the protection of the ecosystem that the whole team has been talking about since the end of last year?
We think that's the right thing to do for the business in terms of ensuring the community's safety and security and the durability of the franchise.
In addition, on the CapEx side, we're continuing to invest heavily on capital expenditures, first, to just get ahead of user growth and engagement and then also to make sure that we've got the compute available to support the growth of a number of the key drivers of our business around feed ranking and ads ranking.
Wehner - Facebook, Inc. Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. Dave, I think you said that the quarter-on-quarter growth rates are going to be high-single digits lower than the prior-year quarter-on-quarter growth rates versus 3Q and 4Q.
Secondly, we're going to be focusing on growing engaging new experiences like Stories and promoting those.
And then, finally, we're giving people who use the services more choice around privacy, and that's coming both in terms of impacts that could be ongoing from things like GDPR as well as other product options that we're providing that could have an impact on revenue growth.
One is that we just started getting a lot of feedback from people in the community that they wanted Facebook to be more about connecting with people, which is really the core of what it's always been, less so about viral videos or news content and just passive consumption.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. So, obviously, we started with ads in Facebook, and that was something we have grown and they continue to grow.
But I think we've launched some things that people are excited about and interested in like click-to-Messenger ads.
In terms of, I guess, going to the GDPR question, we've talked about Ã¢ÂÂ oh, sorry.
But then, Dave, I think you mentioned that because you're giving people more control over their privacy and data that this is one of the reasons why you're expecting the meaningful decel in the second half; so just trying to recognize those two things.
We do think that there will be some modest impact, and I don't want to overplay these factors, but you've got a couple of things going on.
And then in addition, we're continuing to focus our product development around putting privacy first and that's going to, we believe, have some impact on revenue growth.
Sheryl Kara Sandberg - Facebook, Inc. So, on Stories, we've seen great progress with Stories as a format for people to share on our platforms.
I think one of the other things we feel good about over the long run, not really the short run, is that since we have so many different places where you have Stories formats in Instagram and WhatsApp and Facebook, as volume increases of the opportunity, advertisers get more interested.
So I think when you look at the factors going forward, I would say we've got the currency impact, we've got some of the impacts around privacy and the like, but we continue to get good advertiser feedback on ROI.
Obviously, on the safety and security side, those are costs that are layering in that we think are the right thing to do for the business but don't necessarily have a revenue impact.
It also takes into account the ongoing investments we're making in the longer-term innovation work, which I don't think will necessarily have any meaningful revenue relative to the size of the business in those time frames.
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
We recently launched two important ad transparency tools: one to let anyone see the ads any page is running even if the ads aren't targeted to you; and the other an archive of ads with political or issue content that's starting in the U.S. ready for the midterm election.
But I'm confident that we will get this right given our results during last year's French and German elections, the Alabama special election, as well as this month's presidential election in Mexico, where our systems found and removed thousands of fake account pages and groups that violated our policies.
Our teams are focused on building new experiences that help people connect and start conversation.
We've taken strong steps to address a number of issues, including election integrity, fake news and protecting people's information.
The vast majority of ads on Facebook are run by legitimate organizations from small businesses looking for new customers to advocacy groups raising money for their causes.
We're seeing healthy growth in video ads among all advertiser segments.
M&M's UK recently used mobile-optimized five-second video ads on Facebook and Instagram to introduce M&M's Mix, a bag of three kinds of M&M's in one.
Their campaign worked, driving results not just for their new product but for the brand overall.
We know that creating video can be more difficult for small businesses that have fewer resources, so we've launched new tools on Facebook to help anyone make videos that work well on mobile.
When online retailer Overstock wanted to gain new customers and increase furniture sales, they ran video ads in Instagram Stories with a shop now button.
For example, automatic placements help advertisers get better results by showing ads across our platform wherever they'll perform best and at the lowest cost.
SumUp, a German payment start-up that helps small businesses accept debit and credit cards, switched from manual to automatic placements and increased sales by 34% in one week.
Advertisers of all sizes want to know if their ads are working and how to make them better, but smaller businesses don't always have this capability.
Their work over the past several months has helped millions of businesses grow and created new levels of transparency in advertising.
I'd note that European ad revenue growth decelerated more quickly than other regions and was impacted primarily by reduced currency tailwinds and, to a lesser extent, the roll out of GDPR.
We expect full-year 2018 capital expenditures will be approximately $15 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities.

facebook,q3,2018,"So just like most major social apps have feeds, including Pinterest, Twitter, or LinkedIn, but you wouldn't say that those services do the same things, I think many services will have Stories in the future too, but will serve different functions.
It's now growing quickly and I think we'll be in a better position soon, but our effort to shift Facebook from News Feed first to Stories first hasn't been as smooth as I had hoped.
Now, talking about messaging and Stories raises the question of what's the future of our feed product and the Facebook app overall.
From a business perspective, feeds will drive the majority of our growth over the next couple of years, at least until Stories become an even bigger driver.
While there's a lot to do to improve News Feed, our roadmap for the Facebook app is very focused on a few priorities: Stories, which we've discussed; video, which I'll get to in a moment; and a much bigger focus on communities and groups.
When we say communities, we mean both helping people connect with people who share their interests, which is a major need in people's lives, and also building out specific services for bringing people closer together, like helping you find someone to date, or find a job, or buy and sell things, or grow your small business, or create an event, or start fundraisers, or bring together a group to volunteer.
And while people may not spend as much time on some of these tools as they do in News Feed, these are very high-value activities for our community.
Video has grown a lot on our services, but as I mentioned earlier, we hit a dynamic where when it grows in feeds in Facebook and Instagram, it displaces some social interactions, and people tell us it makes the experience less valuable even though they're spending more time on it.
As we look ahead to 2019 and beyond, we're focused on continuing to build our clients' businesses and ours by helping advertisers reach consumers where they are and making ads better.
Today, the primary way advertisers are reaching people on our services is through Facebook News Feed and Instagram Feed.
Feed ads on Facebook and Instagram represent the majority of our revenue growth and the majority of opportunities for marketers to generate ROI.
At the same time, as Mark mentioned, more and more consumers are using stories and private messaging in addition to the time they spend in News Feed and Instagram Feed.
Last year, we started allowing advertisers to extend their News Feed ads to Marketplace, helping businesses reach people where they already shop.
We also continue to invest heavily in technology and people to remove bad content as quickly as possible and prevent it from going up in the first place, while giving advertisers more control over where their ads are placed.
For example, ads in Instagram Stories contributed to our impression growth this quarter, although these ads currently monetize at lower rates compared to feed ads.
And as I said in my opening remarks, I think we're going to be a lot better positioned here in Facebook in the next year.
When you think about some of the friction points you're trying to solve for on either the creative side or the selling-through side with respect to video and Stories, maybe you could call out some of the conversations you're having with advertisers and how you see some of the moves Facebook can make to solve for those friction points looking out to 2019 and beyond.
We have a very large and growing advertiser base, and that gives us we think a really strong position to get people into new formats.
So the right ad in News Feed is different than the right ad in an Instagram or a Facebook story is different than the right ad in Watch, which would be video-only.
Because we are looking to show relevant ads to the right person at the right time, the systems we have that understand in a privacy-protected way what ads people are likely to be more interested in, those work, whether you're in Stories or Watch or Instagram Feed or News Feed.
In terms of what we're seeing as opportunities, I mean, we continue to see good growth opportunities for revenue across both Facebook and Instagram, including both feed and Stories.
I think in terms of impression growth, you're going to have more opportunities in Stories, probably more opportunity on Instagram, but good revenue growth opportunities in both places.
So we needed to figure out a way so that video can grow, but people can also keep on interacting doing what they tell us that they uniquely want from Facebook.
The basic story that we've seen within the Facebook app is, over the last few years, the amount of time that people were spending in the app was increasing primarily because people were consuming more public content, like passive video consumption and news.
And we think that there's a lot more connecting in community that people want there.
On Facebook overall, I feel like we have a handle on what the drivers of this are and we're kind of driving it to be what people tell us they want and what we think is going to be sustainable over time.
We continue to see good growth opportunities across the platform on both Facebook and Instagram and feed and Stories.
I would characterize the launch of Status apps on WhatsApp as being a much smaller thing than a driver of 2019 revenue growth, and it's going to be more about Instagram and Facebook.
We think there's a lot of opportunity for people to have commercial intent, if not have it when they start, but develop it because they see things they're interested in, in both.
First, just, Mark, your comments in prepared remarks on Stories having potential to be a bigger medium than News Feed suggests that the engagement is a net positive in terms of time spent or sessions per user.
And I think we'll get there over time, where the performance for Stories ads will converge with what we have seen in feed.
But I can't tell you just yet what that timeframe is going to look like, but I think we're well-positioned over the long-term because we're leading in Stories in basically every country.
So I think we're still seeing good growth in Europe on the revenue front, and a lot of the similar dynamics playing out in Europe as in the rest of the world where you see good impression growth opportunity, especially in areas like Instagram and Stories contributing to overall ability to drive revenue growth.
When you think about the transition or people using feed versus Stories, there are a couple of things that are different.
I think when you think about the long-term monetization opportunities, it's really going to depend upon the time people spend.
But I think in terms of it converging on feed from any pricing perspective, that's a journey that's going to take years, not quarters.
I think we've made some strong changes on Facebook in terms of meaningful social interactions, and I think the history of our ability to develop and iterate on consumer products shows that we can help people as they evolve, share the things they want to share, and have a very meaningful and important experience in feed as they're sharing.
As there are more Stories and feed, as more people are engaged in Facebook and increasingly in Instagram, that gives us more opportunities just on the supply side of ads.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements.
Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
Public sharing will always be very important, but people increasingly want to share privately too, and that includes both just smaller audiences with messaging and ephemerally with stories.
People now send around 100 billion messages each day using our services that even our second most popular service, Messenger, has a higher daily message volume than SMS had globally at its peak.
People now share more than 1 billion stories every day.
For a few years, we saw a trend where people's time was increasing primarily because they were consuming more video and public content, even as they interacted with friends and family less.
That means the trends in how people are interacting have improved, even though we've purposefully reduced time spent on things like lower-quality viral videos and news to achieve this.
We know that our continued growth depends upon maintaining the trust of the people who use our services and earning our clients' business each and every day in a very competitive environment.
Quarter after quarter, we make improvements that help advertisers use feed ads to launch new products, find new customers, build awareness and increase sales, all in a highly efficient way.
On Messenger, over 10 billion messages are sent between people and businesses every month.
We have a big opportunity to help our large and growing advertiser base expand to new platforms and formats to reach potential customers.
Protecting people's privacy is incredibly important because people and businesses will only use our services if they feel Facebook can be trusted and if sharing on our platform is safe.
Improvements like this one add up and help businesses maximize the value they're gaining from our products over time.
I'd also like to share our initial outlook on 2019 operating expenses and CapEx. We also expect that full-year 2019 capital expenditures will be approximately $18 billion to $20 billion, driven by a continuation of our data center build strategy that seeks to put in place adequate capacity ahead of our needs.

facebook,q4,2018,"For the past couple of years, most of our focus and energy has gone into addressing some of the biggest social issues around the future of the Internet, including election integrity, content governance, safety and security, data privacy and digital well-being.
We've made significant progress and we're going to continue this work, but we're also going to allocate more of our energy to building new and inspiring ways to help people connect and build community.
Our second priority for 2019 is that as we make progress on these social issues, we also need to deliver new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives.
We're going to get to a point soon where people feel like Facebook is about as communities as it - is about communities as much as it's about your friends and family where almost everyone is in a group that's meaningful to them and that community is a central part of their experience.
Now, we're still going to make mistakes along the way, but we now have a clearer sense of the path ahead and we're ready to work with people to understand our role and move towards good outcomes, whether that's regulation on content or data, cooperation on shared threats, working openly to make sure AI best serves people, or just standing up for the kind of open and connected world that we all want to see.
We offer a service free to everyone to help you stay connected with the people you care about, express what you're thinking and feeling, get help when you need it most, support the causes and ideas you believe in, start and grow businesses no matter where you are, and that makes a lot of good possible and we're committed to building technology that people can use to create positive change.
We have focused on making progress in these important areas while continuing to grow our community and our business.
Beyond Stories and messaging, we have an opportunity to connect people and businesses on new services like Marketplace.
Looking ahead, we see more opportunities to use AI to keep people safe on Facebook and help businesses grow.
This is our best estimate of our de-duplicated audience across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. We believe these numbers better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our services.
In conclusion, we are confident in our ability to continue to invest effectively in the key priorities that Mark outlined in his opening remarks: making progress on the major social issues facing the Internet, building new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives, and growing our business by supporting the many businesses that rely on our services.
People are already doing a lot of commerce activity and are really interested in following brands, and I think making sure that, that works is - and does well is a big deal.
And just as we did that in mobile, now we're very focused on doing that in the new things that people are doing, and Stories is a big part of that, Messaging will be further out, but as important as well.
And so we think the mix shift to Stories is a big opportunity for us and it's going to take time to continue to get advertisers in, but we're very happy with demand to date.
And from a pricing perspective, there's - we've got to improve our ability to grow the number of advertisers using Stories and improve price there, but it's going to be more reliant on that in terms of revenue growth.
People really like this in WhatsApp. I think it's the direction that we should be going in with more things in the future.
So I can give you a few more examples like that, but I guess the way that I'm thinking about this is that there's a handful of cases that people are telling us that they want to be able to integrate and communicate more easily across the networks.
One, Mark, on Facebook Watch, what do you think are some of the things you're still trying to solve for on either the content side or the consumer engagement side to drive broader adoption of Watch and turning it into sort of the mechanism for customers that you're trying to solve for over the medium to long term?
And the big thing that unlocked a lot of growth in Watch is we basically were able to move a bunch of the video-watching behavior to a different tab, where people intentionally go to the tab because they want to watch a video and browse and see what's going on.
The two big things that we're really focused on now in Watch are, within the Watch tab, also just making sure that the consumption isn't all just passive consumption and making it so that there are more two-way interactions between viewers and the creators and that we can help build community around that, where we've built this great feature, Watch Party, that allows people to come together with their friends to watch different content and premiers.
So these are all things that make it so the video-watching experience isn't just about passive consumption but about interaction, and that's going to, I think, help really drive engagement as well.
Then there's also the monetization side for creators, which is going to be really important for making it so that we have the content that people want to consume.
This is a long-term direction that we're going to continue making more ranking changes and building more products around, but I think that this is kind of reflected broadly in the numbers that you see on engagement and the growth in daily actives and how people are engaging across the family of apps.
If you look at what percentage of our ads are truly relevant to the people who are seeing them, I think we've done a lot better over the last couple of years, but we have a long way to go.
And then when we have new opportunities that open up like Stories, even with some pressure on pricing, we think that gives us more inventory and more opportunity and more formats, and we haven't really even gotten started on future things like messaging.
So when you think about the types of products that we're building on messaging, where encryption is going to play a huge role, sharing with your friends, where Stories, which is ephemeral, is the main thing that's growing.
And I'll add one thing, which I think David has said this a couple of times, but I think it's worth emphasizing that while I'm excited about the road map that we have and it's going to be great over the long term, the growth of the business over the next year, a few quarters or the near term is going to be mostly based on the growth of Stories and the core News Feed work.
So for Groups, the main thing that we're focused on is making it so that connecting with communities of people that you're interested in is going to be as central to the experience as connecting with friends and family.
And friends and family is always going to be really central to what we do, but we just think that there's an opportunity now to do more and to make it so that people can also be a part of these meaningful communities.
It's also the first priority again for this year, is making - continuing to make progress on the big, substantive issues facing the Internet and our company because there's still a lot more to do here, and this is incredibly important.
At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Facebook Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call.
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
There are now 2.7 billion people using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger each month and more than 2 billion people who use at least one of our services every day.
Going into 2019, we're focused on four priorities: first, continue making progress on the major social issues facing the Internet and our company; second, build new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future; third, keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses, mostly small businesses, that rely on our services to grow and create jobs; then fourth, communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in the world.
Now, I'm not talking about the many day-to-day iterative improvements we make so that ranking gets a bit better or that things get a little faster, but I'm talking about major improvements to people's lives that whole communities recognize and say, ""Wow, we're all doing something new on Facebook or on WhatsApp that we weren't doing before."" For example, Instagram just passed 500 million daily actives on Stories.
This means we're finding ways for video to grow outside of News Feed so it doesn't displace the social interactions that people primarily come to our services for.
And I feel like we've come out of 2018 not only making real progress on important issues but having a clear sense of what we believe are the right ways to move forward.
The result is that people see more relevant ads and small businesses can reach people in ways that only big companies previously could.
Framebridge, a start-up that provides custom picture framing, recently used automatic placements to run ads across Instagram Stories, Facebook and Instagram feed.
They ran short videos to show that their frames make great holiday gifts, and Instagram Stories generated over 25% of their new customer sales.
Last week, I was in Europe and met with SMEs from across the continent who shared similar stories of growing their companies, hiring people and investing in their communities.
But over time, we expect family metrics will play the primary role in how we talk about our company and we will eventually phase out Facebook-only community metrics.
Impression growth was primarily driven by ads on Instagram, including both feed and Stories as well as Facebook mobile News Feed.
On a full year basis, we continue to expect 2019 total expenses will grow approximately 40% to 50% compared to 2018.
Could you just talk to sort of which forms of media, whether it's News Feed or Stories or Instagram, kind of came in better than you thought it originally would a few months ago and what drove the upside?

facebook,q1,2019,"WeÃ¢ÂÂre continuing to see fast adoption of Stories with each of our three Stories experiences Ã¢ÂÂ Facebook and Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp Ã¢ÂÂ having more than half a billion daily actives.
For the last 15 years, Facebook and Instagram have become the digital equivalents of the town square where you can do almost anything you want with lots of people at once Ã¢ÂÂ stay in touch with your friends, meet new people, find communities that share your interests, start businesses, buy and sell things, and organize fundraisers for causes.
Today, people increasingly want the intimacy of connecting privately as well, so I think there also needs to be a digital equivalent of the living room, a platform just as built out with all the ways that youÃ¢ÂÂd want to interact privately.
I expect the digital town squares like Facebook and Instagram will always be important and will only continue to grow in importance, but thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot more to build there as well and IÃ¢ÂÂm excited about that.
There are a lot of open questions and real tradeoffs on important social issues, so weÃ¢ÂÂre committed to working openly on this and consulting with experts and governments as we go.
In thinking about the opportunity and impact to our business, by far the most important factor will be whether people choose to use our products and whether we can build the leading private social platforms in most countries.
People want a private social platform that is as strong on privacy as possible, so delivering this is both in the interest of our community and our business.
And the reason I wrote this is because IÃ¢ÂÂve spent most of the last couple of years focused on addressing the important social issues around the internet, and while IÃ¢ÂÂm proud of the progress weÃ¢ÂÂve made, these are areas, where it doesnÃ¢ÂÂt feel right for a private company to make such important policy decisions by ourselves.
If the rules for the internet were being written from scratch today, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think people would want private companies to be making so many decisions around speech, elections, and data privacy without a more robust democratic process.
So, over the long-term, I believe that that increase in the trustworthiness of the internet can have a much larger positive impact for our community and our business than any short-term hit that weÃ¢ÂÂre going to take.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre making significant investments in safety and security while continuing to grow our community and our business.
Going forward, we will continue making investments to increase transparency, protect our platform from interference, and help keep people safe.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre doing this, because itÃ¢ÂÂs the right thing to do for people, and because itÃ¢ÂÂs good for our business over the long-term.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre proud to announce that we now have 3 million advertisers using Stories Ads to reach customers across Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger.
In addition to helping advertisers make the shift to new ads experiences, weÃ¢ÂÂre making it easier for people to shop directly on our apps.
I also want to thank the Facebook teams who drive that growth, while also making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company.
Note that this does not change our longer-term outlook on the need to invest in core product, infrastructure, innovation, and safety and security, and the ultimate impact of those investments on our operating margin.
So weÃ¢ÂÂll talk about both of these things over Ã¢ÂÂ a lot over the coming months and the plan Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂll share a little bit more at F8 next week in terms of the product roadmap and what we expect to see on this.
So when I first announced that we were going to be moving our private communication services to all be end-to-end encrypted, I was very clear that weÃ¢ÂÂre planning on taking at least a year to go consult with experts and governments and law enforcements around the world to make sure that we have the right safety systems in place to make sure that we handle this really well, right?
In countries where we already are the leading platform, there will be more ability to work on things like payments in the near term and build in additional ways that people want to interact privately.
But in terms of when I expect this to be a real contributor to the business, I donÃ¢ÂÂt think in the next couple of years thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a major driver.
So the long run view should be that you can give us maybe simple pictures, maybe simple videos, maybe an ad youÃ¢ÂÂve produced, and we can do the placement for you, because we think over time our systems will do a better job deciding where your ads should be placed and even helping you target until youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing us build tools in that direction as well.
And then when it comes to how weÃ¢ÂÂre thinking about expense growth as we look beyond 2019, weÃ¢ÂÂre not providing specific guidance but IÃ¢ÂÂd note that we continue to invest aggressively across the business and thereÃ¢ÂÂs no change in our long-term outlook on the need to invest heavily in areas like safety and security, innovation in our core product and infrastructure and the ultimate impact that those will have on our operating margin.
I care a lot about making sure that we want make the right investments in safety and innovation long-term, so IÃ¢ÂÂm committed to doing that.
ThereÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs early, but one of the big questions around Watch that we had early on was what is going to be peopleÃ¢ÂÂs demand to go to a separate tab to have an experience thatÃ¢ÂÂs dedicated to interacting with people around a certain type of content?
So, it was really important to me, and I think to making Ã¢ÂÂ to the long term of what our product stands for it to make sure that News Feed is always about meaningful interaction.
Advertising is going to be the way that the revenue comes in for the foreseeable future, but what we expect is as we build out more commerce-related features around shopping, and Instagram and Marketplace and Facebook and certainly, the private social platform that weÃ¢ÂÂre Ã¢ÂÂ that IÃ¢ÂÂve been talking about I think will lend itself to private interactions around payments and commerce and interacting with businesses in that way, I think what weÃ¢ÂÂre going this is weÃ¢ÂÂre going to build more tools for people to buy things directly through the platform.
But I would just note that we are not changing our overall philosophy of continuing to invest aggressively across the business in these important areas like safety, and security and innovation, which are going to play into continued expense growth both in 2019 and 2020.
And at the same time we're seeing continued pricing growth on feed, and that's true for both Facebook and Instagram.
So on Facebook Stories, we have 0.5 billion people using it daily, and we think that's pretty impressive growth; we're seeing real engagement.
In ads in Stories, we rolled out globally about 1.5 years after launching Instagram so it's still early but we're definitely seeing a lot of value for businesses on Instagram, and we believe same on Facebook.
So I just Ã¢ÂÂ I think it's something we'll be watching and nurturing but it's going to take a while before Instagram Shopping has any meaningful impact on the business.
So on safety, I think given the volume of content that people share, if you want to have any hope of doing it in real time, the only hope is building AI systems that can either identify things and handle them proactively or at the very least, flag them for a lot of people who work for us who can then look at them rather than waiting for people in our community to flag those after they've already seen them.
Most of what we build Ã¢ÂÂ one of the things thatÃ¢ÂÂs different about Facebook and social products is more of it is about people interacting with each other than just people interacting with us, right?
And so weÃ¢ÂÂre certainly very focused on things like video calling and voice calling and ways that people can communicate with voice.

Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
For elections, there have long been laws defining what is political advertising, but we need to update those regulations to reflect todayÃ¢ÂÂs threats like the ways that foreign nation states try to interfere in elections now.
We also introduced Ã¢ÂÂWhy am I seeing this post?Ã¢ÂÂ so people can learn more about what shows up in their News Feed and change their preferences to make their Facebook experience more personal.
When DunkinÃ¢ÂÂ promoted its donut fries with an interactive poll in their Stories ads, more than one in five people, who saw the ad voted, which increased engagement and drove 20% lower cost per video view.
Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with the first quarter of 2018, total revenue would have been approximately $503 million higher.
Absent this accrual our total expense growth rate would have been 46 percentage points lower.
The $3 billion accrual accounts for approximately 10 percentage points of the anticipated expense growth.

Your next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
ThereÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂ definitely has to be some cannibalization for people who are doing feed ads as they get Stories.
That means those people are seeing less relevant ads and thatÃ¢ÂÂs an ad targeting headwind for our business.

Sheryl Sandberg Ã¢ÂÂ Chief Operating Officer
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
This will require investing a significant amount of our engineering resources in building tools to review our products in the ways we use data.
After next year, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to publish these reports quarterly, so people can hold us accountable at the same cadence as these earnings calls.
We also continue to invest heavily in protecting elections Ã¢ÂÂ including more advanced efforts to stop coordinated inauthentic behavior, new ads transparency tools, and more fact-checking partnerships.
With that foundation, weÃ¢ÂÂre starting to explore how a private social platform could become the center of your social experience, for example, by bringing together all of your ephemeral stories from your different apps into one place.
With WhatsApp, which already has incredibly strong privacy and performance, weÃ¢ÂÂre more focused on building out all the ways youÃ¢ÂÂd want to interact in this digital living room.
With millions of small businesses using WhatsApp Business, weÃ¢ÂÂre also building new tools like product catalogs that entrepreneurs around the world can use for free.
This matters especially for the growing number of small businesses that donÃ¢ÂÂt have a web presence or that use private messaging platforms like WhatsApp as their main way of interacting with customers.
Instagram Shopping will improve the experience of browsing and shopping from your favorite brands and creators, while also giving emerging creators a powerful new way to build a business and sustain their community.
The third product area I want to highlight where weÃ¢ÂÂre focused on delivering a qualitatively better experience than what exists today is in the future computing platforms of augmented and virtual reality.
This quarter, we launched our latest variation Ã¢ÂÂ Dynamic Ads in Instagram Stories Ã¢ÂÂ which show people ads for products theyÃ¢ÂÂve already browsed on a retailerÃ¢ÂÂs website or app.
Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with the second quarter of 2018, total revenue would have been approximately $574 million higher.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
I think one of the challenges weÃ¢ÂÂve had is training the market that you canÃ¢ÂÂt just take your TV ads and put them on video Ã¢ÂÂ IÃ¢ÂÂm sorry, put them on mobile or put them into Facebook, because they donÃ¢ÂÂt perform the same way.
McDonalds used mobile app video ads in Facebook and Instagram News Feed and Stories to launch a limited edition called the Big Mac range in the UK.
We are seeing faster growth in impressions coming from Stories and then also coming from geographies that monetize at lower rates on things like Facebook News Feed.
But the privacy efforts do require significant investments obviously and compliance processes, people and then technical infrastructure and those are factored into the 2019 operating expense outlook.
IÃ¢ÂÂm just wondering if you could share what the feedback has been so far from the brands that are in the closed beta and how this has helped maybe some stats if they have them like how it helped maybe conversion for the brands that are doing it versus maybe the traditional way they were selling on Instagram.
Your next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Your next question comes from Mark May from Citi.
Yes. Our current outlook for 2019 does suggests that weÃ¢ÂÂll see margins come down this year versus 2018.
So rather than go to every advertiser both through our sales force and through our online tools where we sell and say we have a new format, you need to create the new format, you need to figure out the placement being able to just take what they are already doing like Feed ads, converted into Stories and place at anywhere helps us move people into these formats.
IÃ¢ÂÂll say one more thing, which is that Stories donÃ¢ÂÂt monetize right now at the same rate as News Feed.
Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre very focused on payments with fiat currencies as well and making it so that when you pay in one service, whether itÃ¢ÂÂs WhatsApp or in Instagram Shopping or in Marketplace your credentials can be shared and thereÃ¢ÂÂs a shared payment system across all those things.
Your last question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.
Our community and business continue to grow, and there are now more than 2.7 billion people using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger each month, and more than 2.1 billion people who use at least one of our services each day.
We continue to focus on our four priorities for the year, making progress on the major social issues, building qualitatively new experiences, building our business, and communicating what we stand for more transparently.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs going to take time to do this properly, and I expect it will take us longer to ship new products, especially while weÃ¢ÂÂre getting this up and running.
I also expect that just as with the work we have been doing on safety and integrity, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue to identify and fix issues as we develop our systems.
Next, I know thereÃ¢ÂÂs a lot to discuss in terms of policy, but I also want to discuss our second priority Ã¢ÂÂ delivering qualitatively new experiences for our community.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre very focused on delivering this over the next five years, building on the foundation we have with Messenger and WhatsApp. With Messenger, weÃ¢ÂÂre rewriting the app from scratch to make it the fastest and most secure major messaging platform in the world, and weÃ¢ÂÂre working towards making end-to-end encryption and reduced permanence, the default for all conversations.
These are huge and important spaces, and we have efforts in several major areas to deliver qualitatively better experiences than what exists today from Instagram Shopping to Facebook Marketplace to payments across our apps to the new Libra project that we announced with 27 other companies recently.
In the future, weÃ¢ÂÂll enable people to use the same payments account to send money to friends and businesses on WhatsApp, shop on Instagram, or make transactions on Facebook.
ThatÃ¢ÂÂs my update on our work on the major social issues we face and building new product experiences.
But this was also an important quarter because now we have a clearer path forward Ã¢ÂÂ not just in terms of product and business, but in terms of guidance from regulators, which sets clear expectations and gives us a foundation to build on.
As weÃ¢ÂÂve been discussing, weÃ¢ÂÂre making significant investments in safety, security and privacy while continuing to grow our community and our business.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre going to continue to make investments to protect our platform, because itÃ¢ÂÂs the right thing to do and itÃ¢ÂÂs good for our business over the long-term.
In addition to improving our ad tools, weÃ¢ÂÂre investing in new ways for people to discover products, engage with brands and shop on our platforms.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre continuing our closed beta of Checkout on Instagram and we launched a new feature this quarter that enables Creators to tag products in their posts.
I also want to thank the Facebook teams, who drive that growth and are making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre pleased with the further growth of our community and business while we continue to make significant investments in privacy, safety and security.
So, while a lot of the content is still provided by people in a way that weÃ¢ÂÂre not covering costs, we do have a strategy of investing in great content that really starts the flywheel growing Ã¢ÂÂ going and weÃ¢ÂÂve been pretty pleased, I mean itÃ¢ÂÂs not the biggest effort anyone has, but weÃ¢ÂÂve had some hits from Tom and Time to Tom and Time to Red Table Talk ,sorry for your loss, and weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing some really nice engagement numbers on these shows.
And the best of them actually carry over into the Facebook community, because the best of the people creating those shows and starring in those shows are also engaging with Facebook, and I think the vision Mark laid out for this all along is that, we should do video in a pretty social way.
Ross, I mean if you remember weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing good impression growth across Instagram Stories, Instagram Feed and Facebook Feed.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve opened a period of, however, long it takes to address regulators and different experts and constituents questions about this and then figure out what the best way to move forward is and thatÃ¢ÂÂs certainly what weÃ¢ÂÂre planning to do with Libra.
I think the way to think about checkout is kind of in a larger picture of what weÃ¢ÂÂre trying to do in terms of commerce and shopping on our services and apps across the board, which is, we obviously have a lot of consumer engagement in our products and thatÃ¢ÂÂs great.
But I will take a minute to talk about Stories ads in general, because I think eventually depending on our ability to use data across platform that applies to WhatsApp itÃ¢ÂÂs probably pretty important part of the story thatÃ¢ÂÂs going on with Facebook right now.
So we do have Stories ads available across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, and I think one of the most important things we learned as we were doing it transition to mobile is if we made it easy for our advertisers to place the ads, make sure they understood the measurement they were having and also make sure the ad format worked, businesses would move more quickly.
But I think one of the successes you are seeing weÃ¢ÂÂre having right now is that we are helping people move to Stories more quickly because of the lessons we learned.
So weÃ¢ÂÂre certainly seeing good growth in places where Instagram is strong, including the U.S., so thatÃ¢ÂÂs been good to see.
So, I think weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing good growth on Instagram.
I mean the way that we kind of see the products now is weÃ¢ÂÂve helped people map out and wire up their networks over the last several years, and now in each of these apps we have opportunities to help people get more value from the networks that theyÃ¢ÂÂve created in some of that is going to be on the social side, especially around creating communities and groups and some of it is going to be more on the economic and opportunity side and there weÃ¢ÂÂre doing a whole lot of projects.
And in Marketplace, we definitely are going to focus on some of the areas that you talked about including jobs is already a pretty meaningful focus where a lot of people do find jobs and business is less jobs through Facebook.
So in the Facebook app overall after helping people connect with friends and family, helping people connected with communities is the next most important social problem that we believe we can help address and thatÃ¢ÂÂs just going to be an area of increasing value in the product.
But before this is really the biggest driver of our business, I do think that thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to be a number of years.
",46.14,0.90010995
facebook,q3,2019,"We're making progress building out the private social platform across WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram Direct, and we have multiple exciting initiatives around commerce and payments that we're moving forward from marketplace to Instagram Shopping to payments in WhatsApp and continuing our discussion on Libra.
Those who follow us closely know that we have more than 35,000 people working on safety and security, and that our budget for this work is billions of dollars a year, more than the whole revenue of our Company at the time of our IPO earlier this decade.
But while we work hard to remove content that can cause real danger, I think we also need to be careful about adopting more and more rules that restrict the way that people can speak and what they can say.
And we do this because we know that if we help people have meaningful interactions that they'll find our services more valuable and that's the key to building something sustainable and growing over time.
I guess that some people are going to think that these decisions may have a negative impact on things that they really care about.
In addition to these challenges, there are a lot of great things that are going on that I am incredibly proud of and excited about and I'm glad that our community and business trends continue heading in a good direction.
We know we have a very important responsibility to keep people safe and continue innovating to help businesses of all sizes grow.
Now advertisers in these areas are required to use a new buying process and by the end of the year people will be able to view all current housing ads in the United States.
I also want to thank the Facebook teams who are deeply committed to making progress on the major social issues facing the Internet and our Company and driving growth for businesses.
In terms of our Family metrics, we continue to grow and estimate that on average around 2.2 billion people use at least one of our apps on a daily basis in September and around 2.8 billion were active on a monthly basis.
As a reminder, the Family metrics are best estimate of our de-duplicated audience across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. We believe that these numbers better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our services.
As I indicated on our second quarter call, we continue to expect a more pronounced deceleration of our revenue growth rate in Q4.
At the same time, we continue to make investments in important areas like privacy, safety and innovation.
I don't think we have any new status to share on this, but I mean overall we rolled out the tab for -- almost the first year we were really tuning it just to make sure that it would be retentive and very valuable for people.
So they are in general -- the way we think about this stuff is, we try not to put something in front of a lot of people unless we're confident that they're going to find it useful and want to come back and use it multiple times and we can put a lot of things in front of people not to try it once, but we want to wait until things are kind of retentive and useful.
The premium content part of it, yes, I think the right way to think about this is almost as marketing to help people try out the tab for the first time.
There are some good tent pole pieces of content that people really love that they come and they check out the product to experience that and then they stay for a lot of the other valuable content that's in there and that might not be talked about as much in the news.
And going to the Q4 guide, is there any color you can give us on how different regions of the world might be impacted against the mid to high single-digit deceleration of the levels of Q3 just so we have a better understanding of where you might be seeing some of those tougher comps or product optimizations play out on a global scale.
In the US, we will have a shorter holiday season, it's hard to know how that's going to play into it just given the late arrival of Thanksgiving, but I think overall the product optimizations that we're comping against in Q4 were global changes.
We're now monetizing with that product and more advertisers are buying from it and then Sheryl is going to jump in and I think give some additional color.
Yes, I think in terms of our core advertising products and growth, it's worth really remembering that our core feed products for Facebook and Instagram are growing nicely and well.
I think we've taken our experience on how to help advertisers migrate to the right places and been able to do that even more quickly in new formats like Stories.
So on that, I think what we're continuing to see with Stories monetization is, that is a product that's experiencing a lot of impression growth.
And I'm still optimistic, I think that the long-term vision and the reasons why I thought this -- we're going to be important and big are unchanged.
So we're seeing a lot of people use these products and love them and because of that I think that we're still going to get there.
So every year that we get to practice and get better and build our brand around Oculus in terms of building the best products that we can in this space, I just think that we're going to be better off when this is really ready to be a completely mainstream thing with hundreds of millions of people using it.
Over time it's an opportunity to maybe slow down the growth, but it's not going to change the dynamics in the near term.
I mean, look, I think a lot of the antitrust questions that are out there that are going to be about our acquisition of Instagram, right.
So we were competing there with things like Facebook camera, but we ultimately thought that we were going to do better work if we were building with Instagram.
It's the test really shows that a lot of people are going to want to use this product.
And one of the questions that we had was, there are of course a lot of things that some people want to do, but not everyone and we weren't sure if we were going to be able to build a secondary tab in the app that could be meaningful even if most people didn't use them.
It took us a little while to really get it to work the way that we wanted, but now it's growing quickly, that's going to be hundreds of millions of people who are using it.
So I think in the future if this works out, what we're going to see is that how people use the Facebook app is going to be, they're going to keep on using News Feed, they are going to keep on sharing with friends and family, but the average person will also probably have one, two or three other apps or kind of secondary tabs that they use that are quite useful for them in connecting with their broader community on Facebook.
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO and Dave Wehner, CFO.
We also recently released - now that we estimate that more than 140 million businesses, mostly small businesses are using our services each month to grow, create jobs and become social hubs in their communities.
Core values on voice and free expression are not partisans, but unfortunately in our current environment a lot of people look at every decision through the lens of whether it's going to help or hurt the candidate they want in winning their next election.
I could be wrong, but my experience running this Company so far has been that if we do what we believe is right, even when it's unpopular for years at a time, then eventually it has worked out best for our community and for our business too.
And as these systems compete, the question of which nation's values will determine what speech has allowed for decades to come really puts into perspective the issues that we face today because while we may disagree on exactly where to draw the line on specific issues, we at least can disagree and that's what free expression is about.
We did that by improving our ads products and creating new formats to help advertisers more easily reach their current and future customers.
We are continually making these basis point improvements to help advertisers save time and money and build their business.
We also continue to build new formats that enable brands to interact with people in fun and engaging ways and make commerce more convenient.

How long does this have to be as resource-intensive from a people perspective or do you see the ability over time as with technologies like AI potentially helping you to get more leverage out of this existing budget, so maybe you don't have to continue to ramp it as quickly as your user base and engagement continues to grow.
Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.
But if you remember at the time, Instagram was focused on helping people take photos, apply creative filters and share them publicly across different social networks including Facebook.
But remember that a lot of the other services that were Instagram's peers and were growing quickly at the time including startups with strong teams and very talented founders like Path don't really even exist today anymore.
Instagram wouldn't be what it is today without Kevin and Mike who are just really incredible product leaders and of course did a lot of amazing work.

",55.41,0.897367
facebook,q4,2019,"Last year, I shared our four company priorities, and they're still our priorities in 2020: making progress on the major social issues, building qualitatively new product experiences, continuing to grow our business, and getting out there and communicating more transparently.
Today, I'm going to focus mostly on the new product experiences we're building, but before I get to that, this is going to be another critical year for making progress on social issues.
We were behind in 2016, but after working to protect elections in countries across the world from the EU -- in the EU to India to Mexico to the U.S. midterms for the past few years, we think our systems are now more advanced than any other companies.
Related to this, just yesterday, we announced that we're rolling out a Privacy Checkup tool to nearly 2 billion people, reminding them of the controls they have and making sure that they're set the way that they want them.
So during this, our job is to keep doing what we think is right on the social issues and to stay focused on continuing to deliver product improvements and better experiences for our community.
The product areas that I'm most focused on for the next chapter of our company are building out the private social platform and more intimate communities, enabling more commerce and payments and delivering the next computing platform.
When I look at the Internet today, we all have this ability to connect with people, content, and opportunities coming from all around the world in ways that were unimaginable just a generation ago.
And across our services, the greatest growth in how people are communicating continues to come from private messaging, small groups, and disappearing stories where your data doesn't stick around forever.
While the Facebook and Instagram apps have developed with lots of different ways to interact with the people you care about, our private communication apps are still pretty much just about texting, so we spent the last year building infrastructure to turn our private messaging apps, WhatsApp and Messenger into richer, private social platforms where you can hang out and be present with friends, find groups with your interest, engage with businesses more naturally.
Commerce and payments is another area that will be important for the private social platform, but also across all of our apps, including Facebook and Instagram.
On the AR side, while we're working on the long-term hardware and operating system, it's worth noting that our Spark AR platform is the most widely used AR platform in the world with hundreds of millions of people interacting with effects every month.
We're focused on creating value over the long term for our community and for the 140 million businesses around the world who use our platform to connect with customers and grow.
As a reminder, the family metrics are our best estimate of the deduplicated audience across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. We believe these numbers better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people use more than one of our services.
And then, Dave, I guess to go back to your comment about the majority of the impact that lies ahead when you're thinking about ad targeting and privacy regulation, is there any more detail you can give us as sort of types of data or types of sort of breakage that you see as potential risk to the targeting and the efficacy of the ads going forward?
So when you think about the shopping experience or the checkout experience on Instagram, these are still very early days, and we're working hard to improve the product and expand to more businesses.
And I think it's important to note that the regulatory and platform changes will have a disproportionate impact on the ability of small businesses to use ads to grow and thrive.
And how are you going about the integration work that needs to be done to make the experience seamless, where you could kind of match inventory levels with what people are actually buying?
We continue to see growth across Facebook, across Instagram in people who are discovering products they're interested in, and we're continuing to make a lot of investments there.
A lot of the work that we end up doing goes towards making it easier for small businesses to be able to -- without a big technology shop, be able to use the same tools, get access to payments, set up storefronts easily, being able to measure the effectiveness of ads.
And then following up on the comment on messaging, I wondered if we can get an update on the way the team is thinking about the messaging component on a monetization front and thinking about some of the more interesting products you might use to monetize the messaging applications, both Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp as you look out over the next couple of years.
We want to make it so that features that get built across Instagram or Facebook or WhatsApp and when people engage on those, it can also make your experience better across the other apps in the family, too.
And we think, in many ways, we're better positioned than anyone else in the industry to participate in the opportunity that should be there over the long run for businesses and consumers to connect on message.
We don't have that rolled out in WhatsApp. Where we are seeing a lot of growth and really exciting metrics right now are click-to-messaging ads.
And so we think the combination of the discovery ads that we can do, clicking through the Messenger right now already shows the potential of how important messaging can be for businesses.
Overall, I mean the way that Dating fits into the strategy here is within the Facebook app, we think that News Feed is really central and that it's one of the only things that we think everyone who uses the app is really going to use on a daily basis.
So I kind of expect in a year or 2, the world that we're going to be in is people use Facebook, they're going to use News Feed, and then they're probably each going to have 2 or 3 other of these social utilities that they find valuable.
And as we start building those, I think that that's some part of the story that you're seeing on why the Facebook app engagement has been strong recently is -- especially as we build more of these things that certainly is showing up in how people use the app.
And I do think that there is going to be a lot that we need to be watching out for this year.
And in Facebook and Instagram, you can interact with a lot of people you know or interested in connecting with them in a number of different ways.
So a lot of what we've been trying to do is make it so that we build out the infrastructure, so that way WhatsApp and Messenger and Instagram direct can evolve rather than being just places where you message folks.
And then I'd say across all of our apps, we're seeing strong adoption of Stories and, on WhatsApp Status products around the world, and that continues to provide another way for people to connect and share.
So this is going to be one of the increasing focuses for us or just the different ways that people want to interact and build communities.
We're not just trying to build things that everyone is going to want to use.
We think something like gaming, hundreds of millions of people are going to want to use it, and that's great.
Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements.
Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
But we should start seeing more new experiences later this year, and this will all be built on a very strong privacy foundation.
So we're taking a number of different approaches here, ranging from people buying and selling to each other directly to businesses setting up storefronts, to people engaging with businesses directly through messaging and a number of things on payments ranging from existing -- using existing national systems like India's UPI to creating new global systems.
Having small businesses succeed is not only key to creating broad economic growth where everyone can support themselves, it's also important to maintaining healthy communities since small businesses are often where people come together.
And it's going to let us build things that we've only dreamed of for the last 15 years, like letting people interact as if they're in person together no matter where they are or letting people live wherever they want and hologram into work so they can access opportunities anywhere and don't have to move to a city or another country to find a job.
So we're going to focus more on communicating our principles, whether that's standing up for giving people a voice against those who would censor people who don't agree with them, standing up for letting people build their own communities against those who say that the new types of communities forming on social media are dividing us, standing up for encryption against those who say that privacy mostly helps bad people, standing up for -- giving small businesses more opportunity and sophisticated tools against those who say that targeted advertising is a problem, or standing up for serving every person in the world against those who say that you have to pay a premium in order to really be served.
This really matters because as Mark said, when businesses of all sizes succeed, they hire people and invest in their communities.
According to 7,000 companies surveyed across 15 EU countries, our apps helped businesses contribute about EUR 200 billion to the European economy just last year.
I also want to thank our teams around the world for working to solve tough challenges while still building great products that businesses use to grow, compete and hire.
Full year 2019 revenue grew 27% to $71 billion, and we generated over $18 billion in net income.
Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q4 of last year, total revenue would have been approximately $295 million higher.
R&D grew 36% and was driven primarily by increased investments in core product as well as our innovation efforts particularly in AR/VR.
Full year capital expenditures were $15.7 billion, up 12%, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings and network infrastructure.
Factors driving this deceleration include the maturity of our business as well as the increasing impact from global privacy regulation and other ad targeting-related headwinds.
Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Dave, has anything changed since third quarter when we're looking at less deceleration this year?
Yes. In addition, growth in infrastructure spend is our large increase in CapEx over the last several years, flows through the income statement as another driver of our expense growth as well.
Following up on the shopping commerce question, I wonder if the focus here includes expanding Marketplace across multiple services or if that seems like better as a distinct application.
Yes. I've been talking a lot about how we're trying to build out our private messaging apps into richer, private social platforms.
Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.
Your last question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo.

facebook,q1,2020,"Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.
For other types of misinformation, we partner with independent fact checkers who have marked more than 4,000 pieces of content related to COVID as false, which has resulted in more than 40 million warning labels being seen across our services, and we know that these work because 95% of the time when someone sees a warning label, they don't click through to view that content.
And since people experiencing symptoms is a precursor to them going to the hospital or getting more seriously ill, this tool can help local governments and health officials plan how to allocate scarce resources like PPE and ventilators as well as determine when it's safe to start reopening an area or when an area will need to have tighter shelter orders if symptoms reemerge.
Now, outside of Facebook, Priscilla and my work at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative with alongside leading experts in science and health continues to inform my views on the best ways for us to assist in this health response and also what we should expect going forward with this disease.
The investments we've made in shared infrastructure that cover all of our different services over the years has helped us manage through this, but it has been a challenge while all our teams have been working remotely.
People used to primarily live stream physical events, but it's almost known as planning physical events right now livestreaming has become the primary venue for many events, whether that's the Pope's weekly mass on Facebook Live or DJs hosting dance parties on Instagram, every day more than 800 million daily actives are engaging with live streams, across workout classes, concerts and more.
Sheryl, will talk about this more, but with so many businesses forced to close their physical storefronts, more are looking to build their digital presences and those which already invested in their digital presences are increasingly viewing them as the primary storefronts.
Mark talked about how our company has responded during this emergency to keep people safe and informed.
Our teams moved quickly to make gift cards available on both Facebook and Instagram giving customers the option to support businesses by paying upfront for products and services they can use later.
We also launched temporary service changes to make it easier for businesses to share critical information like inventory updates, shipment details, or new ways to buy.
I also want to thank our teams for ensuring our services keep running and working so hard to launch new products, so we can continue making a real difference in people's lives.
We are currently operating with over 95% of our full-time employees working from home with safety being the number one priority for those essential workers who need to come into our data centers and other facilities.
While we are by no means operating at 100% of capacity across every dimension of our operations, we have continued to ship new product releases, maintain service availability, review content and stay connected with our business customers.
While this reflects a moderate reduction in the planned growth rate of total expenses, our overall expense growth in the face of expected revenue weakness will have a negative impact on our 2020 operating margins.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan.
Your next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
I think about four years ago, you mentioned that the top 100 advertisers were just under 25% of revenue and coming down.
Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali from SunTrust.
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC.
Your last question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.
So, with that said, I want to use this time today to discuss how we're responding to COVID, what we're seeing across our services, and some reflections on how we plan to run the company going forward.
So, responses have been focused on three areas; helping people stay connected while we're all apart, assisting the public health response, and working on the economic recovery especially for small businesses.
So, this is work that we're uniquely positioned to do, because Facebook is a global community and people use their authentic identities on our service, so that means that we can make sure that the data is meaningful.
In many of the places that have been hardest hit by the virus, messaging volume has increased more than 50%, and voice and video calling has more than doubled across Messenger and WhatsApp. In Italy, for example, we've seen up to 70% more time spent across our apps.
Instagram and Facebook Live views doubled in one week, and we've also seen time in Group video calling increase by more than a 1000% over March.
But in some areas, I think we are seeing an acceleration in pre-existing long-term trends like the dramatic increase in online private social communication that is likely to continue.
The last area of our response that I want to discuss is how we're helping with the economic recovery, especially for small businesses.
So this is a moment where we feel that we're well positioned to be champions for small businesses interests and supporters of important infrastructure that they're going to need in order to move online.
The largest Facebook and WhatsApp communities in the world are in India, and we think that there is an especially important opportunity to serve small businesses and enable commerce there over the long-term.
By bringing together JioMart, which is Jio's small business initiative to connect millions of shops across India with WhatsApp, we think that we're going to able to create a much better shopping and commerce experience.
Along with our strong financial position and the important social value our services provide, we're planning to hire at least 10,000 more people in product and engineering roles this year, so we can continue building and making progress.
As our services play in an especially important role right now, in helping people stay connected and assisting the public health response and working on the economic recovery, I really want to thank all of our employees who are working hard to deliver these services and everyone who has believed in us and supported our company over the years to help us get to the point where we can deliver these services for people around the world.
With more people spending time on our products and services than ever before, we are focused on continuing to deliver free and paid tools to help businesses reach the right people at the right time.
We can continue to pay all of our employees and contractors during this difficult time, which is why we believe we have a real responsibility to help others, especially small businesses around the world.
We have seen increased usage across all of our services, particularly in markets that have been most impacted by the virus, including a surge in video and voice calling on Messenger and WhatsApp. People around the world have increasingly turned to Facebook as well.
With the COVID-19 crisis like all companies we are facing a period of unprecedented uncertainty in our business outlook, certainly in the nearly eight years I've been with Facebook.
And then the second question for Mark, you talked a little bit about SMBs. I'm curious to hear about some of the key investment areas and initiatives you really think you need to execute on to make the SMB offering more comprehensive in '21 and beyond?
So, Brian, yes, the trends that we saw in the end of Q1, we saw pull back, pretty broad based pull back especially concentrated in some of the areas that we talked about, things like travel and auto, but really kind of broad-based, large and small advertisers.
I mean for commerce on WhatsApp more broadly, we're very focused on making it, so that small businesses can have a presence on all of the apps, right, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger and can communicate organically with people and then increasingly can do things that can help them drive transactions.
So we started rolling out things like catalogs in WhatsApp, we're working on payments to be able to complete transactions, and we've rolled out a new ad format, click to messaging ads, where basically a lot of small businesses and different businesses are finding that their message threads with people perform better for driving sales than their websites or other presences.
It's hard to know what is just correlated with the pandemic versus people are doing more video chat or messaging, so therefore they also connect more in other parts of the products, but I do think, overall, we believe that providing a broad set of social tools for people is -- and just providing more value for people does include all of the different services which is important because as you know, some of the services for our business we include ads in and some we don't.
It continues to drive our business and I would say if anything COVID is accentuated the importance of people who are bidding for online conversions.
And then second question is Mark, you mentioned in your opening remarks that something along the lines of high margins are important to the company, especially given the economic environment.
So that way when we go through periods like this, you can make sure that we remain stable and healthy and able to keep on building the things that are important for the long term.
I do think that it's one of those areas where as people can't go out into the world as much, the ability to have technology that allows us to be physically present or feel present even when we can be physically together, whether that's Quest or Portal or any of the software that we're building around video presence that stuff is certainly seen especially large spikes in usage and it's possible that this brings accelerate some of the trends around adoption of things like virtual or augmented reality.
And we'll certainly want to accelerate that aspect of our product road map to make sure that we can serve a lot of those businesses during this period when it can help them with the recovery and get through this.
The other question was monetization on WhatsApp. I think that there is a huge opportunity on WhatsApp if for no other reason than that it has 2 billion people using it and we haven't done significant work on building out the business yet.
So it's -- there is tremendous demand people want to communicate with businesses and we've been in the process of building out the infrastructure to do payments and more commerce, ad units like what I mentioned around quick to messaging ads are performing well.
",44.51,0.8783702
goldmansachs,q2,2015,"I'll walk you through the second quarter and year-to-date results then I'm happy to answer any questions.
In the second quarter, we recorded net provisions for mortgage related litigation and regulatory matters of $1.45 billion.
The second quarter of 2015 was another example of the benefits that come with having a diversified global client franchise.
If you look at our first half results, excluding the $1.45 billion litigation charge in the second quarter of 2015, you can see the embedded operating leverage, with expenses flat relative to revenues that are up 7% compared to last year.
We continue to see the benefit of our leading global franchise, with second quarter revenues at the highest level since 2007.
Equity underwriting revenues of $595 million rose 12% compared to the first quarter, due to an increase in IPOs. During the second quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equity businesses, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter, down 34% compared to the seasonally-stronger first quarter.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and include $153 million of DBA gains.
Net revenues were down substantially from the first quarter, as client activity declined across our businesses and market-making conditions were more difficult.
In Equities, which includes Equities Client Execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $2 billion, down 14% quarter-over-quarter and included $32 million in DBA gains.
Moving on to our Investing and Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.8 billion in the second quarter.
On the other hand, the operating environment for our FICC clients was more challenged in the second quarter.
Our focus is on the strength of our global client franchise, the quality of our people, and the long term trends driving our businesses.
As much as we are focused on the present, we are also focused on the future, and we enter it knowing we have a great set of businesses, we have tremendous client relationships, we have world-class people and execution capabilities, and last but not least, we have an improving competitive and operating landscape.
I think FICC and I&L take a lot of everyone's focus, but in FICC specifically, I wonder if you could help us, how much of that was a late quarter phenomenon?
And then most importantly, I think last quarter you felt really good about market share in client facilitation side of the business, and I'm curious if you can give any comments on parsing that out, the facilitation versus the marks in the quarter?
Early in the quarter, obviously, there was a big reversal in the macro trend with respect to how people were thinking about currencies and interest rates.
And so it's not surprising that we saw reduced client activity in the quarter and obviously more difficult market-making environment.
In terms of ÃÂÃÂ it was really more pronounced as the quarter went along as Greece really dominated the headlines and liquidity was challenged in parts of the market.
Too early to tell in terms of where we are in this quarter, Glenn, but obviously, the news around Greece has been obviously very positive in the last couple of days.
So in terms of how we think about it, and obviously these competitive trends they take years to really formulate.
But I think the big change and I talked about this a little bit in my script, but to be more specific about it, the capital-intensive parts of the business and really let's just start with the fixed income parts of the business, given the regulatory demands around that part of the business to deliver for your clients and drive appropriate returns for shareholders, that is actually where we think the competitive advantage is most significant.
And so, as people exit the business, obviously, the impact of the marginal pressure on risk when you're deploying capital should be beneficial and we're leaders in all those parts of the franchise, but I think this is going to be a multi-year phenomenon.
So as you pointed out, we obviously have been pretty dynamic with respect ÃÂÃÂ I think the greatest example was a year ago when we brought the balance sheet down by nearly $60 million in the quarter.
But just wanted to get a sense, are you seeing any, either market share gains in that part of the business or is it more environment and clients' investors getting more active in the asset class?
I think, obviously, it has been a good solid couple of quarters.
And as I said earlier, as activity has picked up outside of the U.S., I can't tell necessarily whether or not it's share pickup from other firms, but obviously, you've seen actually in the first quarter even, those firms with strong equity franchises seem to be getting the lion's share of the activity.
And then on the tax rate, just wanted to understand, if I exclude the item related to the legal reserve, it looks like the core tax rate still was relatively low versus expectations, in line with last quarter.
With respect to litigation, again, the charge we took this quarter is ÃÂÃÂ the vast majority of that is related to the RMBS Working Group.
Yeah, it's a great question, Betsy, and obviously, a difficult one to think about over the next couple of years.
And I think one of the reasons why, as you point out, we're seeing potential big restructurings on the European side is that even without the SIFI charge potential that we have in the United States ÃÂÃÂ and who knows what they'll do over time, maybe the playing field will be completely level ÃÂÃÂ they're struggling in those businesses at current capital levels.
And I think it's very clear at this stage that the increased regulatory requirements, however you think about them, but let's just think mostly in terms of capital, while obviously very good for the system and significant improvement for all firms.
I don't want to beat a dead horse, but on the litigation question, the litigation charge, presumably to add that much based on the Working Group issues that you referred to, there must have been an event, a point in your discussions with them that began to give you a sense for a figure.
Just trying to think through how that should be thought of going forward in terms of the equity franchise.
So again, whenever you see these kind of market reactions, obviously, it has some impact in terms of how clients think through their portfolios.
And given everything China's done, maybe we should expect as they go through this, there were (39:51) going to be growing pains from year to year, but the long term trend feels okay to us.
And when we think about it, obviously, we're going to move very cautiously in the space and make sure we get things right, because you're right to point out that, like any new business, there are risks and we want to make sure that we work with the consumers and the regulators in absolutely a first-class and best-class way.
So in the debt line we had $547 million, roughly $550 million in revenues in the quarter.
In the equity line, of the $1.25 billion, roughly a third of that actually comes from public market shares that we own, in entities we've already taken public.
Hey, Harvey, earlier you mentioned that you saw that liquidity was challenged in parts of the market when you were talking about the FICC business.
Your next question is from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets.
I think if you look at our that debt underwriting activity in the first quarter, it wasn't as strong as the second quarter, but yet the FICC results were stronger.
So, Harvey, given the challenging market making backdrop that you experienced in 2Q, I was wondering how that informed your thinking around the issue of trading liquidity more broadly.
And so I think away from that the reason why this is difficult is because it's a question of really what is the multi-year accumulation of regulation?

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio.
Investment Banking and Investment Management net revenues increased year-over-year by 13% and 14% respectively.
The increase in net revenues within these primarily fee-based business s largely offset net revenue declines and are more capital-intensive businesses with a 6% year-over-year decline in Institutional Client Services and a 13% year-over-year decline in Investing and Lending.
And for Institutional Client Services, revenue strength within equities helped offset a difficult operating environment for FICC.
Investment Banking produced second quarter revenues of $2 billion, 6% higher than a strong first quarter.
We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including BHP Billiton's $12.7 billion demerger of South32; Synageva Biopharma's $8.4 billion sale to Alexion Pharmaceuticals; and Imperial Tobacco Group's $7.1 billion acquisition of certain cigarette brands and other assets of Reynolds American and Lorillard.
Debt underwriting revenues of $603 million improved 47% quarter-over-quarter, largely driven by an increase in leverage finance activity.
Leading Qualcomm's $10 billion debt IPO, Daiichi Sankyo's $3.2 billion sale of its stake in Sun Pharmaceutical, and AIG's $3.5 billion sale of its stake in AerCap. Within interest rates and currencies, a shifting macro backdrop negatively impacted client activity and results.
While currency has experienced a significant decline, client activity and interest rates, though sequentially lower, remain solid.
Credit was significantly lower, as credit spreads generally widened during the second quarter and activity levels declined.
Mortgages also declined versus the first quarter, as volatility and client activity remained generally low.
Equities Client Execution net revenues decreased 30% sequentially, to $787 million.
Security services generated net revenues of $443 million, up 13% sequentially, reflecting seasonally-stronger client activity and higher customer balances.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting strong corporate performance and company-specific events in private equity, as well as net gains in public equities.
Revenues benefited from a higher average mix of long-term fee-based products relative to liquidity products.
Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits was again accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%.
The combination of current concern surrounding Greece's widening credit spreads and the reversal of certain macro trends led to lower client activity and a more difficult operating environment.
Our relative position both the strength and the franchise but aggregate position of the firm just positions us quite well over the next couple of years if firms follow through on what they saying and they actually restructure and they begin to redesign those businesses.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Maybe just talk about what you're thinking there on traditional bank strategy in general?
And when you think about Europe over the next several years as they work through what is ÃÂÃÂ our research folks have them at 1.5% growth, but as they work themselves more and more away from the crisis, this is a very good environment for a firm like Goldman Sachs where clients need sound advice across all of our businesses.
By balance sheet I mean things like those businesses that were maybe most mispriced relative to the new requirements.
And so what we think will happen over time is potentially repricing, but also the competitive dynamic looks like one where those firms that can't deliver or can't respond or don't have the same quality franchise, they get removed.
So could you maybe just walk us through your ÃÂÃÂ clearly there's an opportunity to make money, but the question is how you view the potentially higher risk in a retail lending format?
Now we do have millions of clients that touch us in our investment management business through our mutual funds every day.
Hey. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC
So first question, you made some reference to it earlier when you talked a little bit about pricing, but it looks like we're seeing some momentum in your Prime Brokerage business.
But is that $2 billion that you had in profit on ordinary activity before taxes in Goldman Sachs International the right number to look at when you're thinking about the potential impact on tax rates?
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.

goldmansachs,q3,2015,"I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio.
IÃÂÃÂll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results, and IÃÂÃÂm happy to answer any questions.
The sum impact of these various events led to lower levels of client activity and a significant repricing of the equity and credit markets.
This was down substantially compared to the second quarter, due to a decrease of industry wide IPOs and secondary offerings, as higher volatility and a decline in prices reduced activity.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the third quarter and included a $147 million of DVA gains.
Net revenues were down 9% from the second quarter and market-making conditions continue to be challenging.
Moving onto our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $670 million in the third quarter.
The declining global equity markets negatively impacted net revenues and public equities during the quarter.
This would seem like the pay off and yet a pick up in volatility in several asset classes, it feels like actually the world that was coming your way, but yet the revenue reduction for Goldman relative to peers, and IÃÂÃÂm not just talking this quarter, last couple of quarters is more pronounced.
IÃÂÃÂm just trying to do the smell test of all, why is that, because I actually do think that things are lining up that you would be more important to your clients, not less and there would be more opportunities, not less.
So when we think about the forward and we hear the announcements and weÃÂÃÂre in this part of the cycle, but itÃÂÃÂs going to take a while for that to transition through, because I think so far itÃÂÃÂs been more than announcements than a retrenchment, and you wonÃÂÃÂt really see it happen in all the steps weÃÂÃÂve taken until you see a pick up in client activity and the competitive environment continue to shift, that may take a while.
I really think itÃÂÃÂs a question of client environment.
And then just as a follow-up, maybe on capital and the ratios, if you have the CET1, maybe like the fully phased immerse of the transitional, and then just given the decent buffers, just any outlook in terms of where you think you would run that?
And as a shareholder, if you want a collection of businesses, and if you actually look at our performance, consistency of ROE, and returns and earnings, weÃÂÃÂre the most stable.
I think the capital rules, as they come into play and the balance sheet impact of those capital rules in the class has forced a very natural repricing in terms of how much balance sheet we and the industry can provide the clients.
But certainly in the commodity space several quarters ago, there was a lot of activity where certainly competition, which if you want to call that pricing power, I think of it a little bit differently.
And then in the derivative businesses globally, as youÃÂÃÂre seeing firms exit parts of the CDS business and other parts of the equity derivative businesses, I think itÃÂÃÂs early days, but certainly youÃÂÃÂre seeing a reduction in competition, and that translates into pricing power or maybe better said better returns.
And we feel like we maybe able to provide a differentiated product that is accretive to the firms current returns, but itÃÂÃÂs going to be slow going obviously, we built lots of business at Goldman Sachs this is a new business.
But when we think about liability management, again it itÃÂÃÂs really about making sure we have the strongest financial footings at any given point of time.
So, I know youÃÂÃÂre asking me question narrowly, but in terms of running those businesses and particularly FICC, it really is multipart.
So for example weÃÂÃÂre not the biggest emerging markets firm as you know, because we donÃÂÃÂt have offices in hundred countries and itÃÂÃÂs never been the biggest part of our footprint there are certainly always things that weÃÂÃÂre focused on and if you think about our client base, weÃÂÃÂre more skewed I think, because weÃÂÃÂre not the biggest lender in the globe, weÃÂÃÂre more skewed to professional money managers and investors and you saw and you could see their activity moves around.
But we feel good about our client engagements and our market shares, but itÃÂÃÂs a multi-part question is ÃÂÃÂ itÃÂÃÂs not just about clients although theyÃÂÃÂre the most important part and running these businesses, it really is about margins returns over the long-term.
But the breakout I gave you last time really was public equities, which were down and they [part 11 1: 41]more or less in line with global markets and they started $4 billion at the quarter and so certainly there was just the path to mark-to-market.
And then the second question is, kind of what percent of the business would you say pricing is more rational than itÃÂÃÂs been in the past?
So, on the second part IÃÂÃÂd say itÃÂÃÂs the trend is improving in terms of rational pricing, but itÃÂÃÂs in a market where the client engagement from quarter-to-quarter has been very different right, so we saw it in the first quarter, we saw less in second quarter I think that I would answer the electronic trading question as sort of long-term.
Clients really look to de-risk or add risk and they tend to trade electronically, so I would say itÃÂÃÂs a trend, but I donÃÂÃÂt have the specific numbers for you Mike, in terms of the quarter contribution of electronic versus cash, but we can certainly get to that stuff.
Well, I donÃÂÃÂt want to guess on a ballpark, certainly in the third quarter there was a meaningful pick up in electronic activity relative to cash in the equities business and again I donÃÂÃÂt want to guess at a number for you Mike, weÃÂÃÂll be happy to get you one.
I just wanted to follow-up a little bit first on the composition of the change in revenues in equities and FICC from the second to the third quarter in FICC you alluded I think to rates first off as having contributed significantly, and then you mentioned credit and mortgages, was that kind of the ordering of the degree to, which they impacted the revenue move?
Yes, we saw it more in those two businesses, but it was still challenging obviously for credit markets.
And then just final question, which I think is going to relate to I&L, in the release you alluded to a pretty hefty decline in level III assets linked quarter about 15%.
I think itÃÂÃÂs always natural for folks to question when the market has been robust, whether there is information content in the actual activity level as peaking and maybe thatÃÂÃÂs a factor.
But when you look at past cycles theyÃÂÃÂve been more significantly driven by LBO activity where certainly you can get some market capacity and how much debt can be borrowed and itÃÂÃÂs a 100% accurate to note that certainly the cost of financing is a contributor to the transactions that are happening today, but theyÃÂÃÂre much more strategic and a reflection of slower global growth and how confident CEOs are at this stage.
I think if I look at your disclosures you guys balance sheet was up to a level we havenÃÂÃÂt seen in a I think over a year I think balance sheet was up 20 billion plus quarter-over-quarter yet it was a volatile environment, it just looked like you pulled back on risk at least in the bar, can you kind of just help me think through that, you didnÃÂÃÂt close on the deposit franchise acquisition this quarter ÃÂÃÂ third quarter?
Going into the fourth quarter how should we think about the full-year comp ratio in terms of that thereÃÂÃÂd be upward pressure on it if the full-year revenues miss a bit more from here or continued downward pressure the fourth quarter ends up being better and driving you above where you were last year?
The you made a point in the press release about the IB backlog building and just was kind of curious whether or not in your view thatÃÂÃÂs a function improving business outlook or just deals getting held up due to market volatility in some of the trends that we saw impact the FB underwriting line?
And part of that is the markets being more challenges, and challenge in part of the season, but I think that the more important takeaway is less about market influence over the quarter and more about activity levels client confidence, which certainly at times for CEOs would have been tested as we came during the quarter.
So, again itÃÂÃÂs just itÃÂÃÂs the nature of the portfolio, it wonÃÂÃÂt always necessarily be this way in the quarter, but there will be opportunities for us to sell assets and in taking companyÃÂÃÂs public and those kind of things those were usually on a schedule, it usually donÃÂÃÂt happen instantaneously they can certainly get delayed by market activity.
Harvey, I appreciated all your comments on the quarter FICC strategy how are you still committed to business at the same time arenÃÂÃÂt going to be complacent.
And just want to get a sense as to and trying and obviously making a concerted effort not to simply be complacent whether youÃÂÃÂre going to look to shrink risk on and any meaningful way within that business if the pressures persists on the revenue side?
So, I talked about the fact that we made a number of acquisitions in asset management and that fee-based business continues to grow and be a bigger part of the firm.
I think the trade-off obviously is whether or not in making those reductions, does that really impact your ability to deliver to clients.
Can you give us a sense of how we should think about sort of the quarter-to-quarter risk management practices within that unit, given how market volatility can have such a profound effect on revenue recognition in any given period?
And ultimately, if the markets decline for extended periods of time or increase for extended periods, obviously that drives value of underlying assets and it drives activity for all businesses in all industries.
So we obviously consider that I think the most important risk component in the discussion is about the point of actually establishing the investments and thatÃÂÃÂs a long-term process of being disciplined that has to be the philosophy, so look if we see a number of quarters of back to back declining in market that may be the right time to actually being to put capital to work which is why we run with excess capital and we run with excess liquidity because we want to be there for those opportunities and we want to be there for our client.
So, just wanted to see whether or not you think coincidentally, the way that this line is up as you go through the calendar year, revenues are typically stronger in the first half, and you get the comp ratio benefit in the second half and somehow coincidentally that kind of hedges each other.
We are always looking at ways where we can enhance the client experience and so you know all these acquisitions which I mentioned, they really break down to three large buckets, secular growth opportunities like advisory and in that it was referenced in the ÃÂÃÂ as I said in the Pacific Global AdvisorsÃÂÃÂ acquisition, and those things like new product capabilities where we certainly develop new products internally, but there are times both in demand is better for us and thatÃÂÃÂs an example, that would be Westpeak and ActiveBeta and then there are times when we just want to scale existing products like money markets and you have seen us do acquisitions in that space.
In our liability structure, we just like that having a diversified geographic client base, source of liabilities, we just think thatÃÂÃÂs prudent risk management.
In terms of things weÃÂÃÂre trying to do, we feel pretty good about the diversified business.
I mean, if you think about the course of the year to be sitting here basically nearly flat revenues with our fee-based business is picking up activity, which is compensating for our capital intensive parts of the firm, which you would expect to be more challenged in this kind of market environments.
WeÃÂÃÂre always going to look ways to improve the business.
I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
These provisions largely from legacy issues reduced our annualized return on common equity for the first nine months of the year by approximately 3 percentage points.
Not surprisingly, we produced lower quarterly revenues across many of our businesses, given both declining asset prices and reduced level of client activity.
Investment Banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.6 billion, 23% lower than a strong second quarter as underwriting slowed.
Debt underwriting revenues of $557 million were down 8% quarter-over-quarter, a decrease of industry wide issuance volumes was partially offset by acquisition related financing.
During the third quarter, we actively supported our clientÃÂÃÂs financing needs leading HP Enterprises $14.6 billion debt offering related to a spin-off from HP, BiogenÃÂÃÂs $6 billion debt offering, and SimpornoÃÂÃÂs [ph] $1.4 billion rights offering.
Currencies improved sequentially, as the devaluation in the Chinese yuan sparked significant client activity within our emerging market franchise.
Credit decreased, as client activity remains generally low amid continued spread widening.
Mortgages was significantly lower as conditions remained challenged with limited client activity.
EquitiesÃÂÃÂ client execution net revenues decreased 29% sequentially to $555 million.
Broadly speaking, client activity declined versus the second quarter, as higher volatility and global equity market weakness impacted investor conviction and risk appetite.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $370 million.
Assets under supervision reached a record $1.19 trillion, as long-term net inflows more than offset market depreciation.
With respect to long-term flows, organic net inflows were strong at $23 billion.
Over that timeframe, total long-term net inflows were $195 billion.
Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Any steps in terms of vocal adoption happened a number of years ago, where we shutdown certain business.
Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
If youÃÂÃÂre just looking at that set of metrics and obviously our supplementary leverage ratios in very good shape at 58, but CCARs are binding constraints.
So itÃÂÃÂs really two parts weÃÂÃÂve seen some of it in Europe where competition used to be sort of more significant, but also given the requirements around collateral worlds and things like that where you may have at times had marginal participants actually pricing that levels where we would have thought the risk return didnÃÂÃÂt make sense.
Now youÃÂÃÂre seeing more rational and improved pricing IÃÂÃÂd say thatÃÂÃÂs a general trend.
Okay, thanks for taking my questions.
Questions on trading both equities, and fixed income.
And then other things, that are potentially balance sheet consumers like longer dated derivatives swaps and certainly when commodities has picked up, we have seen circumstances where and this is obviously augmented by the fact that their trading houses have gone through some pretty significant pressure now.
What weÃÂÃÂre saying reduce competition, but again itÃÂÃÂs harder to see it certainly translate through unless the client activity levels are high.
It really does sound like there was very significant positive activity in terms of just being able to reduce positions?
I think thatÃÂÃÂs just good practice.
Thanks for taking my questions, Harvey.
Good morning Harvey.
We have a long history obviously managing counterparty exposure, which has been tested through pretty volatile markets and again the most important decision made at any point in time is when you establish that credit line itÃÂÃÂs really no different than lending, but obviously the dynamics are different.

goldmansachs,q4,2015,"I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs' Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio.
Revenues were down slightly compared with last year and expenses were significantly higher due to approximately $4 billion of net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters.
We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including SunGard's $9.1 billion sale to Fidelity National Information Services.
Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $616 million in the fourth quarter down 11% sequentially as debt issuance slowed.
Equity underwriting revenues of $228 million were up 20% compared to the third quarter as IPOs increased from very low levels last quarter.
Debt underwriting revenues decreased 21% to $440 million due to a decline in leveraged finance activity.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter down 23% sequentially and included $54 million of DVA losses.
Excluding DVA, revenues were down 10% quarter-over-quarter as many businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market making conditions.
Interest rate in currencies were lower sequentially as client activity declined.
Mortgages continue to be challenged as spread widened and the prospect for higher rates and client activity remained generally low.
Equities client execution revenues were roughly consistent sequentially at $562 million.
Securities services generated net revenues of $430 million up 13% sequentially.
During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $64 billion to a record $1.25 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity products.
Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remained roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2015 and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 37.5%.
Our global core liquid assets ended the year at $199 billion.
While our balance sheet was roughly flat year-over-year, Level 3 assets declined by 33% to $24 billion.
A glass half full question of this increased volatility across some of the asset classes, using [indiscernible] clients of losing money, but is there any case to be made that [FICC] revenue pie can bottom and actually grow a little bit over the next say two years given the changing monetary landscape things like that monetary policy of landscape?
Your next question's from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.
All right, I suppose over the last few quarters it does look like the market risk assets have been steadily declining.
Your next question's from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities, please go ahead.
In addition, the combination of continued strong performance for our clients and the diversified set of offerings drove a record year for our Investment Management business.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our fixed and equities businesses; net revenues were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down 10% compared to the third quarter.
For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $7.3 billion down 13% year-over-year, where challenging market conditions and lower levels of client activity in our micro businesses, credit and mortgages, offset stronger client activity and a favorable backdrop for our macro businesses, particularly rates and currencies.
In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, flat sequentially and included $14 million in DVA losses.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter.
In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion.
And most importantly we've been able to accomplish these things while maintaining leading positions across all of our businesses, transforming our financial profile, prudently managing our risks, adapting to regulatory change, continuing to invest in our future and positioning the Firm to provide significant operating leverage when the environment improves.
We certainly donÃÂÃÂt control the opportunities set, however we do control several things; how we build our client relationships, how we invest in our people, how we adapt to change, how we allocate our capital, manage our risks and control our costs, and finally, how we invest in the future.
Are we looking at the wrong things meaning, I'm about to ask you your energy exposure and I should be asking you your sovereign exposure to Italian sovereigns or Italian banks like, I'm just curious to your thoughts on where we are besides the market going down?
So, look obviously the first couple of weeks of the year have been difficult from a market perspective and the last half of the year and continuing the dramatic decline in commodity prices broadly has been disruptive for the market.
Look, these things are never going to be a straight line and so it's not surprising to some extent that the markets responding to China, reduced activity volatility in markets this way.
We don't run the businesses for the bull case, but I think that, and there certainly is a bull case in terms of fixed income activity.
So I think as we look forward over the next couple of years, when you start adding in things like the competitive environments.
And then maybe just some thoughts on the incremental operating leverage in the model, I mean the Firm has been very disciplined in expenses despite effectively four years of no top line growth.
So generally speaking, you remember during the course of the year that there was a change to the FASB accounting which was a driver in terms of the NAV and the look through the funds and the other driver obviously, to get back to Christian's question which is as we monetize things they become public equities.
And then just on the expenses, I think you guys you have mentioned, you have done a pretty good job of balancing the investing versus the environment, but just want to get your sense when you think about what you're focused on the regulatory, the IT side that you need to invest versus areas where if we are in weaker markets and activity starts to dry up, where can you pull back on the cost front?
Yeah, so I think -- but from a compensation perspective, compensation is always going to be driven by performance, most importantly at the Firm wide level and then obviously bottoms up from individuals to businesses and through [indiscernible].
Couple of questions, one on I&L again, in the past sometimes you've given us some color on how much has been either realized or mark-to-market and I get the $4 billion on equity component.
So looking at I&L as I said during the quarter, net interest income was really the bulk a driver of the debt line and in terms of I&L relating to non-event driven most of the activity was really event driven or public marks.
Okay and then on a question regarding the stress test, a lot of people thinking out loud about what potential scenarios the Fed could throw at us and I'm just wondering on prior stress tests, are you given full credit for the hedges that you have on in the various asset classes that you're trading in?
So, when we're thinking about the commodity business that you've got, maybe you can talk through a little bit on how your positioned for the trend that we've been seeing here year-to-date?
So, we've been very committed to the commodities franchise and obviously we have a very strong banking franchise and so this is a part of the cycle and I'd say, broadly across commodities where clients are going to be in need of advice, they are going to need capital market solutions, they're going to need potential hedging solutions depending on where they sit in the cost structure or scheme of things.
In commodities -- well just talk commodities in a fixed income context, as I said in my prepared remarks, it's pretty obvious we took share in Investment Banking over the course of the year.
In terms of the FICC activity, it's hard to see it when activity is low but certainly really not in comparison to commodities where activity has been high to us, we've picked up significant share but that's probably not surprising given how much people have pulled resources out of their commodity businesses or least they said, they have over the last couple of years globally.
I think Mike for us, if this translates into somehow, which we don't see today but you never discount any possibility, if this somehow translates into a real drag on a long-term economic activity or economic growth, but as I said before when I was asked the question and it's just an opinion, lots of folks have been on this side of this discussion.
When we talked to our people internally, it feels like the degree to which the market is focused on energy exposures has managed to discount the long term tailwind to the consumer and a reduction in cost across the globe.
Now we were early to the cost cutting because we felt the activity levels declining after 2009 and that's how we managed through the cycle and you've seen us do this in the equity businesses and sometimes these cycles are long.
And then just a follow-up question, since no one's asked it, I'll ask, I know we're only a few weeks into the year and the market backdrop has been, God awful, but how would you characterize activity levels since the beginning of 2016?
Maybe we should talk a little bit about M&A with the volatility that we've seen in the market I think some have been concerned I guess about the impact on M&A I guess both in the near term and what it means to for the cycle?
So, again obviously we had a pretty significant pickup in activity over the last year and Goldman Sachs market share grew dramatically with that.
Given your market share gains in M&A this year, do you get the sense that that's also true with Investment Banking in specifically M&A transactions?
I've obviously heard everything that you have said this morning and I recognize of course that you donÃÂÃÂt run the business to any particular metric ratio, but to the extent that revenue conditions sort of stay as they've been over the past few years and call it around that $34 billion level.
We see growth in parts of our businesses and so where we see growth and where we think we can take share, we're going to invest.
And again, we run the Firm for multiple years and so -- but that's the way I would think about answering the question, but we see opportunities.
And last year, we had dominant market share and tremendous activity levels across the industry.
Revenues might be $34 billion for a couple of years because a lots going on.
So I think look again at its core, we're correlated to long-term economic growth and what we're really seeing in the markets in the second half of the year was really general concerns about economic growth that might be isolated to specific markets but really that's what was driving activity levels.
I think that is a very complicated question which is very difficult for anyone to answer, which is, there's my own view there is not a rule that has had a big impact on market liquidity or lending across industries.
Just a quick question on Investment Management, I mean, you've benefited from a couple of acquisitions there over the last year.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.
The firm's actual results and financial conditions may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio.
Net earnings to common included a $161 million benefit related to the successful tender of our APEX securities.
These concerns translated into significant price pressure at the beginning of the quarter across both equity and fixed income markets.
Global Central Bank activity was front and center again during the quarter.
After raising rates in December for the first time in more than nine years, the market heavily debated the Federal Reserve's future actions.
Within Investment Banking, for example, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes declined by 57% year-over-year.
Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, 5% lower than the fourth quarter as we saw lower client activity across M&A and equity underwriting.
We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including BG Group's ÃÂÃÂ£47 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell; BT Group'sÃÂÃÂ£12.5 billion acquisition of EE Limited; and PETCO Animal Supplies' $4.6 billion sale to a consortium of investors.
Debt underwriting revenues were up 16% to $509 million and benefited from strong investment-grade issuance.
During the first quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Newell Rubbermaid's $8 billion financing to support its acquisition of Jarden, Vista's $4 billion loan and bond offering to support its acquisition of Solera, and Devon Energy's $1.5 billion follow-on offering.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially, as client activity improved in many businesses from weak fourth quarter levels.
This led to a challenging backdrop for our clients with weak investment performance and drove difficult market-making conditions for the firm.
However, activity within currencies declined compared to a strong first quarter of last year.
Mortgages continue to be challenged as spreads widened for some products and client activity remained low.
Higher volatility and global equity market weakness at the beginning of the quarter impacted investor conviction and risk appetite.
Security services generated net revenues of $432 million, up 10% year-over-year on improved spreads.
In equity securities, markdowns on public investments entirely offset net revenues in private investments.
Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $87 million.
Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined by 40% versus the first quarter of 2015.
Our global core liquid assets ended the first quarter at $196 billion and our balance sheet and level 3 assets were $878 billion and $24 billion, respectively.
As we look forward, we are committed to remaining nimble and efficient operators, disciplined capital allocators and prudent risk managers.
Hey, good morning, Glenn.
I'm just curious, are there specific things about your business mix and client mix that doesn't compare as much versus the past in activity levels, things like credit being real slow right now?
And if you feel like any of the balance sheet reductions or Volcker implementation has impacted the forward earnings power?

Hey, good morning.
Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc. And given the regulators' willingness to sacrifice that liquidity to ensure improved safety and soundness, I'm just wondering how that informs your strategy on balance sheet and inventory management?
I have yet to see a very good analysis that breaks down in great detail the impact of negative rates, the fact that we had declining spreads for multiple years that increased asset holdings for mutual funds compared to the shrinkage of bank balance sheets and come up with something that really does a great cost-benefit analysis.
Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc. Well, thank you for taking my questions.
Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Just want to ask the revenue question maybe another way and maybe from the top down.
Just when you think about asset productivity at the firm level or revenues per asset, is it really all about increasing velocity here as client activity hopefully improves?
As you guys think about just further steps that could be taken from here to reduce expenses if the backdrop remains challenging, I know you're always evaluating those, but are we at a point where the focus is really on reducing costs or maybe the footprint in low return areas that would reduce revenues but they'd still have a positive net impact?
Your next question comes from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets.
When do you start thinking about entering new business lines which are radically different from the ones that you're in now under the understanding that you can't get anything more from what you're doing other than waiting for the tide to come in?
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
Moving to Underwriting, net revenues were $692 million in the first quarter, up 4% sequentially as a pickup in debt underwriting more than offset a slowdown in equity issuance.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, up 20% compared to the fourth quarter.
In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, up 1% sequentially.
Net revenues declined 23% year-over-year and reflected the impact of a challenging environment for our clients and the firm.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $87 million in the first quarter.
In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion.
During the quarter, management and other fees were down 6% sequentially to $1.2 billion due to a change in the mix of client assets and strategies.
In conclusion, the first quarter was obviously a difficult period for our clients, the markets and our opportunity set.
I think when you look at the year-over-year, obviously, we had a very strong first quarter 2015 relative to the peer set.
And then, more importantly, for the equity dynamic going forward, like maybe size the portfolio fair value versus cost basis, see if there are any marks in the quarter that, knock on wood don't repeat next quarter?
In terms of the equity line, both private and public, basically the public portfolio was down roughly $140 million during the quarter and that was offset by private marks.
I know in any given quarter it's kind of tough on, I think, the market share standpoint, but I feel like when revenues are weak you can't really tell market share and then when revenues rebound, you can figure out who gained and who lost.
In terms of the longer-term observation around the competitive dynamic, again, in a quarter like this, hard to see it when our clients are experiencing such volatility and such stress, but I think based on announcements and parts of the business where we're seeing client flows move, engagement with clients is quite good and we're getting good feedback.
So I think a quarter like we just had actually only makes the competitor forward look better, but we'll see.
When you look at what has happened through the quarter and the rebound in the markets, I'm trying to just gauge on the parts of the business that are as simple as markets are up and so you should start to see some improving trends versus maybe on like the I&L, you mentioned the provision on the debt side.
Can you just talk a bit about the disconnect between the markets, the improvement that we're seeing there and what still feels like sluggish client activity, maybe better than January/February, but here's the S&P up a couple percent year-to-date, credit spreads have tightened.
I guess the question is, like, is it a timing issue where we need more stability for activity to pick up in a bigger way, or is it the underlying economy's not strong enough?
But I think after a tough first quarter like the whole market has experienced, I think that there may be a slow reaction function in terms of how various market participants engage the marketplace.
I think generally I would agree with your statement over very long periods of time, but I think in terms of the M&A cycle that we're in now, while off a little bit from the levels of 2015, the level of dialogue there feels quite good.
And then just separately on expenses, obviously good cost control in a tough revenue quarter.
We've talked about it a lot, that this is a performance-driven culture, and the performance wasn't great in the first quarter and as a result you saw compensation and benefits expense down 40% year-over-year.
If you think about the things we've done over the last couple of years, since the middle of 2013 we've taken the ICS balance sheet down 25% and FICC RWAs, market and credit down 30%.
You've danced pretty well the last three to four years without revenue growth, but it seems like you're getting to the end of what you can do and your return on equity is now in the single-digit range, and I think consensus has it in the single-digit range for the year.
I think you're right to point out that for four years running we are one of the very small handful of firms that have had double-digit ROEs. This is a quarter, I certainly wouldn't sit here and tell you, we are happy about this quarter, but we will do what it takes over time to make sure that we deliver for our clients and maximize the returns for our shareholders in a prudent way.
Goldman is obviously a leader in applying technology to traditional voice trading businesses and other things, and you've been pretty vocal in the past about how you transformed equities, and foreign exchange, and cut head count while picking up market share and the process.
But it feels like we're in an evolution where obviously clients are looking for efficiencies and we're looking for efficiencies, but the reality is that a vast majority of the fixed income market is more bespoke; it won't lend itself to that.
So, is it right though, for us to think that there is going to be a significant transformation in the cost structure and the capital structure that you apply to FICC over the next couple of years?
Well I think, look, you've seen some of the evolutionary steps we've taken in terms of the balance sheet reductions and the risk-weighted assets that I talked about earlier.
It may be the case that over periods of time, depending on how much client activity there is, but the extent to which it shifts to electronic channels like we've seen under the regulatory framework for swap execution facilities, those transitions happen very, very quickly, and we adjust very, very quickly.
So I would say with respect to the liquidity dynamic, if I had to rank factors and it's very hard to quantify these things, I would say factors like conviction around the markets because of the sharp decline in the oil price and obviously the negative interest rate environment and the big shift to, as you said, the buy-side holding lots of assets, I think those are as significant a driver in the current environment as is regulation, given that banks are holding less inventory globally.
I think that underpinning all of that is that when you look at the client base, regardless of how much velocity may be in their current trading activities quarter-to-quarter, the core needs in terms of their need for liquidity and our desire to provide it, that remains.
I would say that, look, the space has been under extreme stress which emerged over a fairly short period of time, measured more in months than years, and so I think our expectation that there will be active dialogue across the industry.
On trading broadly, thinking about the importance of hedge funds to your trading business, should we temper our expectations for a bounce back here in your revenues, even if we see some market improvement, given the pressure that that client base has experienced this year?
So, look, we think of all of our clients as important, but obviously, we've had a big commitment to the hedge fund industry across equities and fixed them for a long time.
Because in periods like we went through in the first quarter, obviously, they have a tendency to derisk and it reduces trading velocity over many months, although it may be, for example, an active day from time to time.
Could you maybe help us out a little bit on, number one, how we could see ÃÂÃÂ I think you indicated in the press release that sequentially down quarter-over-quarter on the backlog.
Versus the end of the year, as we would imagine, given what happened in the equity markets, the equity backlog is up and obviously we had a bit of an outperformance, it looks like, versus the rest of the industry on debt underwriting, and that's down sequentially.
So I think ÃÂÃÂ look, you have to give the regulators a lot of credit over the last several years for making ÃÂÃÂ and I'll focus more on the U.S. financial system, including things like CCAR.
Well, I think if you go back to history, even ignoring the recent regulatory changes that both clients and market providers participated in, if you go back to some of the formation of Tradeweb back into the early 2000s, I think all of those vehicles, and there may have always been challenges at the start, whether it's TRACE reporting or Tradeweb or things like that.
Guess I'm curious as to how you're thinking about the pre-tax margin in that business over the relatively near-term, say the next 12 to 18 months?
I know it's fluid, but just trying to think about the size of really proactive opportunities to improve asset productivity by changing the balance sheet mix outside of just a pickup in client activity?
I was wondering, if we take as a given that your balance sheet is in pristine condition and that you're the very best, or among the very best in each one of the businesses in which you operate, we run up against a situation that the world has changed dramatically so that we are now nine years into Goldman Sachs not being able to come close to what it did in 2007.
So, look, at this stage, it's our best estimate, Marty, in terms of where we think the year will go.
The other thing which I know is a hard question to be able to answer, but it's kind of important when you start thinking about just what are the core earnings and trying to take out some of the volatility that happens from quarter to quarter.
You have to go back to the third quarter of 2011 or back to other periods where markets have been extremely volatile to see this kind of performance.

goldmansachs,q2,2016,"Good morning, my name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today.
I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2016 Earnings conference call.
IÃÂÃÂll walk you through the second quarter results, then IÃÂÃÂm happy to answer any questions.
This was also reflected in equity markets; for example, the S&P 500 was relatively unchanged for most of April and May. In addition, we saw sequential improvements in global investment banking volumes.
Investment banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, 22% higher than the first quarter as we saw increased client activity across equity and debt underwriting.
We advised a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including NorthStar Asset ManagementÃÂÃÂs $16.9 billion tri-party merger with Colony Capital and NorthStar Realty Finance; Great Plains EnergyÃÂÃÂs $12.2 billion acquisition of Westar Energy, and Hewlett Packard EnterprisesÃÂÃÂ $8.5 billion spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corporation.
Debt underwriting revenues were up 42% to $724 million and benefited from asset-backed issuance and strong leveraged finance activity.
During the second quarter, we actively supported our clientsÃÂÃÂ financing needs, participating in MylanÃÂÃÂs $6.5 billion investment-grade offering to support its acquisition of Meda AB; U.S. FoodsÃÂÃÂ $1.2 billion IPO; and the approximately ÃÂÃÂ850 million IPO of Philips Lighting.
Equities client execution net revenues of $587 million were up 25% sequentially.
Better market making conditions for most of the quarter and select corporate activity drove improved performance.
Securities services generated net revenues of $422 million, down 2% relative to the first quarter as seasonally stronger client activity was offset by slightly lower customer balances and spreads.
Equities securities generated net revenues of $626 million primarily reflecting company-specific events, sales, and gains in public equity investments.
Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $485 million and included more than $250 million of net interest income.
Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Hey, good morning Glenn.
Hey, good morning Christian.
Yes, itÃÂÃÂs an unsecured consumer loan product.
Thanks, good morning.
Good morning, Harvey.
Good morning, Harvey.
Can you just help me understand - when you say $700 million of run rate savings, from what level and under what revenue circumstances?
Yes, given where weÃÂÃÂre running now, I would say something just shy of 30 feels like a better expectation where we stand right now.
Hey, good morning Harvey.
Is thatÃÂÃÂyou know, as we talked about double counting and SIFI possibly going into CCAR, it looks like you got a break on operational risk that almost equals your SIFI charge almost exactly.
ThatÃÂÃÂs all other factors being equal going into 2017, and this year that will translate roughly into $350 million of savings this year.
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures thatÃÂÃÂs posed on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $993 million in the second quarter, up 43% sequentially as capital markets activity picked up from the first quarter.
This was up significantly compared to weak activity in the first quarter due to an increase in IPOs. Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.7 billion in the second quarter, up 7% compared to the first quarter.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, up 16% sequentially as market making conditions improved in many businesses from the first quarter.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.1 billion in the second quarter.
Now, after severance that number is going to be more like 350 this year, but obviously weÃÂÃÂre staying very focused on this and I think you see that performance has been down, and with that compensation and benefits expenses down 28% year-to-date.
Then your comment on the investment banking pipelineÃÂÃÂs down, IÃÂÃÂm just curious, how much of that is just off of great numbers and as you execute, including the debt underwriting that you talked about, and then versus how much does Brexit play a role in just kind of slowing things down on deals that might have been happening across Europe?
So when you look at the backlog, I think one way to look at it is the year-over-year, so if youÃÂÃÂre actually standing here at the end of June last year, obviously the second quarter and first half of last year were very dynamic.
In terms of Brexit, where we sit today, given I think that the base case expectation is that the dynamic is going to play out over a long period of time, and in some respects it may contribute to some of the same factors that contributed to a very active M&A environment, other than maybe very specific transactions that are geographic in nature, that are really driven by geography, which is generally few, when we talk to our bankers, if we continue in this low growth environment, they donÃÂÃÂt feel sitting here today that Brexit is going to be a headwind but obviously itÃÂÃÂs going to be a dynamic situation.
ThereÃÂÃÂs a whole host of processes through which we go through in terms of how employees elect to get compensated, et cetera, so thatÃÂÃÂs an issue obviously we monitor very closely in terms of our foreign currency risk broadly across the globe, managing a global business, but I wouldnÃÂÃÂt point to that as a significant consideration, although itÃÂÃÂs a consideration of the many things we look at.
Going into Brexit, client activity tapered off, but at the point of Brexit and potentially thereafter in a number of our businesses, we either near-peak volumes or peak volumes, or new peaks, so that was quite good to see.
In terms of the longer term perspective on Brexit, as I said before, this looks like this process is going to take a while, and weÃÂÃÂre hopeful, along with everyone else, that the parties that are engaged in these negotiations will be prudent and thoughtful because obviously itÃÂÃÂs good for all of us, a thoughtful negotiation and outcome will just be good for economic growth.
So one of the drivers in this quarter, as I referenced, was an asset-backed related activity, and there was one significant transaction where earlier on, we had committed capital to purchase a portfolio, which ultimately translated through in the debt underwriting line that would not be included in a lead table, so itÃÂÃÂd be difficult for you to see.
First, just on the G-SIB surcharge, just wanted to get an update where you stand, and then probably more importantly when you think of wanting to reduce that versus taking advantage of opportunities to take market share, just given some of the exits that weÃÂÃÂve seen throughout the industry, just want to get a sense on where youÃÂÃÂre at and kind of the pullback versus the growth, just given some of the dislocations out there with some of the competitors.
We believe that and all firms obviously should make that a priority; but youÃÂÃÂre right to say that as the competitive environment is shifting and a number of our competitors have stated restructuring plans, we want to make sure that in all of our efforts, whether itÃÂÃÂs managing our capital, that weÃÂÃÂre focused on costs, that we remain full service across all of our businesses and weÃÂÃÂre there for our clients.
So with CCAR, I know you guys donÃÂÃÂt disclose what youÃÂÃÂre going to do, but just from a quarter as we kind of go through the third quarter through 2017, should we expect the same type of ramp that we saw last year just in terms of the lighter up front and then the heavier buybacks as that plays out?
So whatÃÂÃÂs expected of CCAR and the CCAR process, obviously you say the 11.1 million shares this quarter and the 1.7 billion-plus in dollar buybacks, so last yearÃÂÃÂs test had some idiosyncrasies in it which led to this profile where, to the extent of which and we ended up using capacity that weÃÂÃÂre repurchasing, that we were more constrained in the early quarters versus the later quarters.
In terms of theÃÂÃÂI think what youÃÂÃÂre asking, the question really relates to the harvesting in the funds.
Could you talk a little bit more about investment management in terms of why the fees were so weak there, say, versus a year ago?
So the biggest driver in the quarter when you look year-over-year is obviously the incentive fees, and thatÃÂÃÂs reflective of the environment and incentive fees from time to time are going to be lumpy.
So as you know, in the business obviously we have a number of different client segments so itÃÂÃÂs full service across a number of different lines.
But just more broadly speaking, maybe give us an update on where you are on the lending thought process overall, and then on the deposit side as well, I think you did the brand conversion of the deposit acquisition this past quarter.
IÃÂÃÂve emphasizedÃÂÃÂyou know, weÃÂÃÂve emphasized a number of times that weÃÂÃÂre going to be very deliberate and slow with this, so weÃÂÃÂve developed one product which we plan to launch later this fall, so thatÃÂÃÂs where we stand [indiscernible] over the next several months.
We, as you know, like sometimesÃÂÃÂsometimes I think that because we donÃÂÃÂt announce targets in advance, that people misunderstand a bit about the way we run the business.
I just wanted to return first of all to the capital management question and maybe ask it a little bit differently in terms of what we might expect over the next several quarters.
Should we be thinking in terms of that 5% run rate, or maybe a couple of percentage points higher in line with what youÃÂÃÂve done recently?
Now, the second things we do and the strength of the financial footings of the firm, obviously youÃÂÃÂve seen us do a huge amount of work and you see it reflected in our ratios with 13.7 standardized at the end of this quarter.
Ultimately, that gives you the flexibility to either return it or not, and thatÃÂÃÂs why youÃÂÃÂve seen the uptick over the past couple of years in terms of levels of activity.
This actually turns out to be a related question - you caveated in the release that the environment for FICC continues to be pretty challenging because of low rates and volumes and low client activity, which implies that there is a more normal run rate that you think is achievable.
You know, Guy, IÃÂÃÂd say that first in terms of client activity levels and run rate, if you will, run rate is a difficult thing but I donÃÂÃÂt think anyone would disagree that when you look at the trading activity levels and the industry trends over the last couple years, obviously theyÃÂÃÂve been in decline.
When you look at the factors in terms of our clients and what they need, our clients are still there and they still need those services, they need them from us, and so the type of environment weÃÂÃÂve been in, if you actually look at the sort ofÃÂÃÂfor lack of better language, the violence of the first quarter in January and February, and then the concerns about Brexit in the second quarter, I think itÃÂÃÂs fair for us to say these feel like low levelsÃÂÃÂthese are the type of factors that contribute to reduced client sentiment, reduced confidence, and as a result reduced activity.
So when volumes pick up, we feel like we see it, but itÃÂÃÂs difficult for me to tell you what the run rate will be over a long period of time, given the dynamic nature of markets and the unique place we find ourselves with respect to global growth and interest rates.
So can you elaborate a little bit on those metrics, even though I recognize it was just for a short period of time, but the metrics that told you that you were picking up market share, because up until now when weÃÂÃÂve asked you that question, youÃÂÃÂve generally said itÃÂÃÂs still hard to measure, itÃÂÃÂs early days, youÃÂÃÂre not really going to be able to tell in this kind of environment.
So with respect to [indiscernible] client services, thatÃÂÃÂs just reflective of activity levels, and as markets were volatile in the first and second quarter, you saw that translate through with respect to demand, market prices and spreads, so thereÃÂÃÂs nothing really to highlight there other than its reflective of the environment.
In terms of the client base and our client footings, weÃÂÃÂre always looking to grow our market share across all segments, across all regions, and so we continue to focus on that and thereÃÂÃÂs always things we can do better.
Okay, weÃÂÃÂll move onto the next question, and thatÃÂÃÂs from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
No, I think thatÃÂÃÂs maybe just reflective of different product lines that businesses may have.
Yes, I think thatÃÂÃÂs a reasonable question in terms of just the unique nature of Brexit.
ItÃÂÃÂs interesting how the worldÃÂÃÂso the market reaction, the activity level right around Brexit obviously I donÃÂÃÂt think was surprising to any of us.
I think that may be a little bit different, to go back to the core of your question about things weÃÂÃÂve seen in the past, so this normalization was so quick that it actually may be something thatÃÂÃÂs a better harbinger in the near term usually following one of these events for activity levels.
If we stay in this low growth environment, unless something is really uniquely impacted by Brexit and if the negotiation process takes a long period of time, then as I said, our bankers donÃÂÃÂt necessarily see this being a headwind.
I think the answer is itÃÂÃÂs just too early to tell in terms of how this process was going to unfold.
I think when you were walking through INL, you said that NII was around $250 million or so, so if weÃÂÃÂre run rating that at about $1 billion, when we look at your INL balance sheet in the Q and just using the last quarterÃÂÃÂs numbers because I doubt theyÃÂÃÂre that different, if we sum up the debt and loans, you get to about $70 billion or so, just over, which is a little over a 1% net yield.
If there are opportunities and client demand in investing and lending, which tend to be longer term commitments of capital, obviously we engage in those also, but we donÃÂÃÂt allocate down a capital in a way that says, okay, hereÃÂÃÂs your capital Mr. and Mrs. Business, you use that, weÃÂÃÂll see you in a year.
I know thatÃÂÃÂs been debated for some time, but do you have any sense as to what form that proposal might take and whether it could compel any changes in terms of how you strategically manage that business?
WeÃÂÃÂll have to see what ultimately the rules look like, but obviously weÃÂÃÂre very committed to those clients.
We continually review all the businesses to ensure that weÃÂÃÂre maintaining the right footprint, so this is all about making sure that we find the right balance between our commitment to clients over the long term and expense management, and obviously the first half of this year has not been the greatest environment, so youÃÂÃÂre just seeing us respond to it.
The other thing I was going to ask you was on this quarter and the headcount reductions, where the severance costs would probably hit, when you look at kind of dividing it, if you just said well, youÃÂÃÂre at full run rate in the second quarter, which I know you probably werenÃÂÃÂt, but $175 million per quarter, and then you look at the net for the year youÃÂÃÂre talking about for this year of being 350 net severance then being possible $350 million, I was trying to think of the timing in relation to the gains in the sense of the expense savings and how that might have affected the second quarter.

goldmansachs,q3,2016,"I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
I'll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results and am happy to answer any questions.
Investment banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, 14% lower than a strong second quarter.
Breaking down the components of investment banking in the quarter, advisory revenues were $658 million down 17% compared to the second quarter as industry-wide completed activity declined.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.7 billion in the third quarter up 2%compared to the second quarter.
FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter up 2% sequentially.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.4 billion in the third quarter.
On expenses, last quarter we discussed the $700 million savings initiative that we undertook in the first half of the year and we continue to look at additional means of improving our efficiency without impacting our global client franchise.
While there are currently economic headwinds in several countries globally, our focus on efficiency across all of our businesses and regions allows the firm not only to maintain, but also to invest in our client franchise through the cycle.
I'm just curious when you look at the quarter we just had in FICC particularly, is it more like you had a nice pickup like first quarter of '15 and you're setting this up for keep calm like things have returned back to normal or is this possibly a little bit higher activity environment given the uncertainty?
I think in some respects that speaks to a weaker third quarter environment last year, but I have to agree with you.
You talked about some company-specific events, some sales and the up markets, but I guess the question is, is are you finding opportunities that will also put money to work especially on the equity side.
When you see it again this quarter it is going to close to 80% debt, but selectively we're certainly seeing opportunities whether they be in what we recall other forms of equity, real estate or other areas, but selectively we've seen some good opportunities in corporate equity.
So a question on your consumer lending efforts, given the firm will be facing a very different demographic than you have historically faced, may we just talk about how you think about reputational risks and how you mitigate it?
This year, we had a bit of flexibility in terms of how we'll approach the next couple of quarters, but a lot of this i6s going to be driven by edging out the environment and demand for the balance sheet.
You know how we think about capital management, and share repurchase for us is not to be equated with dividends and so it's going to be dynamic.
In terms of the stress testing, white paper and govern it relates comments I'd say at a high level, obviously, they put a ton of work into this with various constituencies.
So we manage the firm obviously on the forward-looking basis in terms of how we stress tests.
But I think our starting point puts us in a great position and again the treatment of share repurchase and we'll see what happens with balance sheet and other things.
When you look at some of the things that the Fed has put out there on physical commodities and some of the pressures on that part of the market versus what you guys have been doing on the debt side, just where do you see the outlook based on maybe some of these potential changes, the increase in RWAs?
As you know, we've been in the commodity business for decades, and we think it's really important that the Federal ReserveÃÂÃÂs taken the lead here in terms of an important area of focus for us in the industry, but especially as it relates to ultimately establishing uniform standards across the industry.
Because as I step back and look at some of the names I cover, there seems like it could be one of the meaningful new initiatives that's out there in terms of change in the profile the company a little bit, and I think more disclosures over time will be helpful to be able to track the performance.
And that in terms of return for long term, if that's kind of where you're getting, obviously, I talked a lot bit about the consumer here but we built this business to be accretive in the long run to Goldman Sachs returns.
Did you see some of the benefit of share gains this quarter as part of your capital markets revenue?
So with respect to the market share, certainly over the course of the past year, I would say there's been periods, particularly things like some of our core strengths, Prime Brokerage in fixed income, across the regions, we've seen discrete shifts in market share.
I would say when we look at it in terms of the core businesses, for example, like credit, as we monitor those market shares, certainly with certain client segments like asset managers, it feels like we're picking up market share.
We told you forever that as a conceptual matter, you should expect in periods where revenues should decline that compensation and benefits expense should lag that and obviously, we talked to you ton about operating leverage.
I would say that Brexit potentially is something that could drive share to the U.S. I think what we've witnessed over the last several years is U.S. firms like ourselves with really, really strong market shares and leading business positions whether you look at FICC, investment banking, equities, asset management, if you're a leader in a franchise throughout this cycle, particularly as activity picks up, I think there is share to gain.
And I look at this and I'm thinking is there an opportunity for you to allocate a little bit more in this environment and continue to generate some nice sized trading revenues?
I think what's most important about that observation is just the capacity we have under the capital ratios, so obviously.
Obviously, corporate private equity has been slow over the last couple of years, but that $21.5 million 20% of that now is made up of real estate globally.
The assets have been performing, the markets have been generally going up over the last couple of years and you've seen that performance as I&L segment.
I guess the other question, also I&L-related is, and had this has to do with the negative operating leverage comment that you had made for the Firm broadly.
About pricing you mentioned -- we talked about market share, but have you seen given that some banks putting less capital to work than others, any impact on pricing in any of your products, and there is the follow-up as well on the tax rate now that is coming lower again what are you thinking about for the future?
But again in this low volume environment I donÃÂÃÂt know how much that you will see, in other words, the same low volume, low growth environment we have globally that's contributing to what it looks like in the future extraordinarily strong competitive environment for our businesses is the same thing that doesnÃÂÃÂt allow for lot of price improvements.
And so I think these one of your things where even though it has taken while you need environment that is challenge for a while or to get competitors retreats of the same challenges donÃÂÃÂt allow for price adjustments, it maybe overtime you see price adjustments, but certainly things the more capital intensive parts of the business like prime brokerage where we are market leader.
Maybe just a question on Asia I guess in a more positive way, you have the Hong Kong, Shanghai connect going into place later this year, it seems like when the Hong Kong Shanghai connect went in you guys had a nice boost in equity trading the industry did in the first half of 2015.
I think more broadly, well it might not be a straight path to increasing volumes, I think more broadly in Asia our perspective is and with China that we are on a long upward trajectory of activity and our role and ability to work with clients in the region, whether its trading, advisory, capital raising, this just feels like a very long positive trajectory, but itÃÂÃÂs not going to be straight line.
But the activity levels that I mentioned in terms of completed transactions in the market, obviously down over year after very, very healthy levels.
So it does feel like we are starting now again into a market where a lot of that activity that got pushed from the first quarter into the second quarter that that still exists.
So we feel reasonably good about activity levels in the capital markets on an intermediate basis.
Now in terms of the fund size, we have been talking about $5 billion to $8 billion, thatÃÂÃÂs what the team feels is the right size for the horizon that they are thinking about.
I think you commented that the quarter wasn't a particularly strong one, even though the year-over-year growth was good.
But just thinking about the strategy for this business, longer term, looking at the activities more broadly, it's been a very good profit source, historically, but it also consumes significant amounts of capital.
So I think you're right to underscore, which I mentioned earlier, the fact that over time, the CCAR requirements under -- let's just use private equity investing and corporate equity have certainly increased.
But as I mentioned before, one of the nice things about launching this fund is it does gives us flexibility in terms of how to think about deploying that capital and it creates a new important product for our clients.
But to the extent to which I think at this stage whether you look at the supplementary leverage ratio, standardized, advanced, we have the tools in place through our return on attributed equity framework, the ROE framework, which we talked a lot about.
And the team has done a very good job in their advisory businesses and so that I would say would be the more meaningful part of the driver in terms of this quarter's flows.
We focus on the clients in those businesses where, as you know, we have leading market positions and so we feel good about that.
But a lot of the things are outside of our control and I would say that in aggregate, when you look at the vast majority of our businesses, this is not an extraordinary environment, despite the fact that third quarter performance was strong on a relative basis, there's lots of challenges regionally.
I would say that broadly speaking, and this won't be completely inclusive, but I think you can define our technology strategy as focused on client engagement and those tools and services we can deliver to clients that provide differentiated value to those clients, and you see that doing us in our capital markets businesses and obviously you see us creating that with Marcus.
As you know, you've been following us forever in terms of broadly speaking and it may not be the case in any given year.
Ultimately a more favorable backdrop and improved client sentiment translated into year-over-year revenue growth in three of our four business segments.
Although revenues declined sequentially, our investment banking backlog remained robust and was up versus last quarter.
We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including ARM holdings ÃÂÃÂ£24.4 billion sale to Softbank Group.
Equity underwriting revenues were $227 million down 16% compared to the second quarter due to a continued weak backdrop for equity issuance.
During the third quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs, participating in Postal Savings Bank of China's $7.4 billion IPO, Great Plains Energy's $2.5 billion follow-on and convertible offering to support its purchase of Westar and Fortis' $2 billion investment grade offering for the purchase of ITC.
Rates was down slightly as client activity was driven by the continued discussion around potential Central Bank actions.
Equities client execution net revenues of $678 million were up 16% sequentially, reflecting better market-making conditions.
Security services generated net revenues of $387 million down 8% relative to the seasonally stronger second quarter.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $920 million, reflecting company-specific events, sale and gains in public equity investments.
Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $478 million and included approximately $275 million of net interest income.
Long-term fee-based net inflows of $14 billion were primarily driven by fixed-income products.
All of these actions, combined with more than $30 billion of earnings since 2011, position the firm to grow our capital ratios and simultaneously bring our basic share count to its lowest point ever.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
And then completely unrelated, any color on the regional performance within fixed income trading this quarter?
Yes, I think that there was some -- there was -- before the commodities NPR came out the fed had also I think made some noises about asking for congressional guidance I guess on cutting back on merchant banking that's allowed within broker.
Yes. Brennan Hawken
Hey Harvey, Wanted to start off with just a follow-up question relating to the earlier merchant banking discussion.
It is quite evident that you have made significant strides in mitigating your standardized RWAs. But the advanced risk rated assets have actually crept higher.
Yes. We will adapt if needed but right now we feel we have more than enough capacity.
Good morning Harvey.
Good morning Harvey.
Yes, thanks very much.
Hi Harvey, actually I'm all good.
Yes. Do you feel like you could put deposits maybe in asset management?
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
",48.47,0.511842
goldmansachs,q4,2016,"Okay, now letÃÂÃÂs walk through the fourth quarter and full year results then Marty and I are happy to answer any questions.
Switching to the back half of the year, the global economic outlook improved reflecting solid economic reports particularly in the U.S. As a result, net revenues in the back half of the 2016 increased by nearly 16% year-over-year and included two consecutive quarter of 11 plus percent returns on equity.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter down slightly compared to the third quarter.
FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the fourth quarter, up slightly quarter-over-quarter as many businesses benefited from increased client activity.
In equities, which include equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion down 11% sequentially.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter.
This quarter, we obviously had the election and a couple other events and things went bonkers, but it feels very different to me and more permanent and client needs are changing and we have monetary policy diversion, so I'm leaving the witness here, but does it feel different to you guys and does that equate to this could be the first year in many that the fixed income fee pull could grow?
I would say you could look at our fourth quarter, but I think itÃÂÃÂd be better to look really at the second half of the year and what we saw from clients in the second half of the year was basically a build of confidence and expectation that we might see stronger fiscal policy, divergence of interest rates that we weren't heading into a deflationary cycle more confidence about economic growth, and so I would say there was increased optimism around the world.
Just wanted to get a sense depending on what potential changes happened with policy and regulation, is there some way to give us some context on the amount that has been spent whether it's on regulation, compliance, technology it maybe since 2011, 2012 that could either shift around depending on the outlook, obviously thereÃÂÃÂs a lot of core and thatÃÂÃÂs going to stay in place, but just wanted to get a sense on what that increase has been despite you guys imaging the overall expense base well?
I think the thing that we've been able to do is as we've invested and as weÃÂÃÂve comply with the rules, we never be use technology and training across the teams to be as efficient as possible which is why this year you would have seen that non-compensation expense was the lowest expense since 2007 and we were able to also execute the $900 million run rate savings, but who knows where weÃÂÃÂll end up in terms of the rule set, but obviously weÃÂÃÂll always look to comply and comply in the most efficient way possible over time.
It's been a while since we've been in an environment or people may more positive on like the growth outlook, and just wanted to get a sense and this is somewhat Glenn's question and you answer it, but maybe broader on trading and banking.
What do you guys look at in terms of seeing that pick up in client engagement, I know you mentioned the IB pipeline is up quarter-over-quarter but even on trading in terms of balances, investment management maybe inflows, just wanted to get some sense on how we can kind of see the follow through or the impact of better economy in that translating into in a stronger revenues?
Look the thing that informs us the most is the work that all of our people do whether they are in banking, asset management, whether they are in equities or fixed income all around the globe engage with their clients every day.
And as you know over the past several years thereÃÂÃÂs been a general sense of concern with respect to global growth that was reinforced by a lot of the monitory policy around the world.
Just give us some of the increased optimism that youÃÂÃÂve talked about on this call and the pipelines, just kind of big picture, how do you think differently about staffs, call it how much you lean forward versus trying to optimize, itÃÂÃÂs like a last several years you and the industry have been focused on optimizing to kind of lower pool of revenues got for regulatory environment.
This is the first change since the announcement about Gary Cohn, so you know Harvey, how do you kind of approach your new position and then for Marty, how does your past experience you know help you or maybe present a challenge for you in the CFO role going from CIO to CFO is somewhat unique?
I would say the following I think if rates continue to rise and itÃÂÃÂs a reflection of optimism and concerns around deflation abate and concerns around economic decline debate and they are replaced with expectations of economic growth and activity and confidence and client sentiment continues to shift.
I think you are right to say that obviously industrials are representative but itÃÂÃÂs very idiosyncratic and a year like this where equity issuance is down.
And this reflects a couple of things, obviously the performance weÃÂÃÂve delivered to the clients but I do think itÃÂÃÂs the nature of the capabilities that have built over a number of years.
So quick question, I know itÃÂÃÂs been touched on a couple of times, but itÃÂÃÂs one thatÃÂÃÂs definitely I think front of investorÃÂÃÂs minds here, so hopefully you donÃÂÃÂt mind me touch it on it again.
I think itÃÂÃÂs very difficult to quantify just like it was difficult to quantify in 2012, 2013, 2014 how concerns around deflation and low economic growth will impact activity in a number of businesses.
It seems like up taking comp ratio in ÃÂÃÂ16 was probably more of a revenue story, so want to confirm thatÃÂÃÂs true and then when we think about maybe the other side of that blade or the other blade of that knife if we start to see revenue environment improve, how should we think about operating leverage at Goldman given all of the work that youÃÂÃÂve done on the expense front which youÃÂÃÂve talked about a couple of times?
Obviously over the last several years, whether itÃÂÃÂs around expenses, de-risking the firm and growing the capital ratios, returning the capital all that work has really been about positioning the firm, while at the same time obviously maintaining all of our connectivity to clients with really, really significant operating leverage.
There were a handful of transactions thatÃÂÃÂs itÃÂÃÂs always going to be the case in a marking making business when you are providing liquidity to clients that could have an impact that was the case this quarter.
Got it, and then a much broader question, I know you donÃÂÃÂt like to set ROE targets but I was wondering if in the context of what you might call for example unshackled interest rate sort of in a post QE environment and more broadly some other things that we talked about in terms of the new administrations goals and expectations thereof, can you speak to a realistic but aspiration ROE?
We run the business through thoughtful and efficient deployment of capital managing expenses and making sure we have the best people and weÃÂÃÂre focused on our clients.
Maybe just talk about the revenue side of regulatory change, I know it's not an easy question to answer, but I think there's been a lot of I guess hope and talk about sort of an easing of regulation what that could mean on the revenue side.
So I don't know if there's a way to just sort of talk about it generally in terms of where do you see the most constraints right now and what would potentially benefit you the most whether it's easing of market making rules, whether it's some changes like we saw in the UK around exempting cash from the leverage ratio, if you could help that would be great?
I think what we've seen and one of the things I think gets lost in the global dialog around regulation is that you know eight years past the crisis, the body of work that's been created by the regulators whether it's Basel capital ratios, the implementation of CCAR, stress testing broadly globally, the leverage ratios, the requirements around liquidity, all those things that were designed to address points to systemic risk, clearing, margin requirements, all of that data reporting, I think sometimes gets lost in the narrative and have to step back and look at the past eight years and realize that and itÃÂÃÂs a credible body of work that regulators, the industry participants and the clients have actually created.
I think long - I think the dialog around regulation and whether or not there should be some degree of pause and stepping back, I think that started really at the beginning of last year maybe a little bit before you saw some of that in the Basel Committee across the second half of the year, and obviously I think market participants regulators and also it seems like a very reasonable point in time to step back and assess we obviously have gotten some great benefits out of the regulation and the question is, is there a cost in economic growth.
In terms of liquidity, I think it's fair to say that feedback from clients and itÃÂÃÂs not reason it's happened over the last several years across the industry.
I think this activity picks up and volume begins volume you get improvements in liquidity, but every day we come in the door and we're offering our balance sheet, our clients in the best possible way that we can.
Okay and then I guess maybe as a follow up to that, I mean to the extent I guess I'd say consensus expectations build in two or three rate hikes a year, at what point does that become you know the kind of catalyst that you talked about in relation to commodities for activity?
Those were all positive catalysts what they'll be like quarter-to-quarter very difficult, but again coming out of eight years of declining interest rates, I think would - none of us really wanted to get used to that.
So I have follow up just to Jim's earlier question, specifically on tax policy and a comments Harvey that you made on M&A, you said that you view the changes really as more of a timing issue, but one of the constraints that we've been hearing from a lot of folks, is that efforts to broaden the tax base might in fact include restrictions on interest expense deductibility and could increase financing costs and reduce appetite for future debt.
Understood and maybe just sticking to changes in the GOP regime and the implications I could have, but focusing more on the regulatory side there's been a lot of discussion on the prospects of possible repeal or less strict enforcement of Volcker, and Harvey I know you touched on some of the change in terms of just broader messaging, but it just remains to be seen how that might impact your business, I know it's a little bit early, but I just want to get a sense as to if we do see an explicit repeal of Volcker how that would change your strategy, not just on the trading side, but would it in fact how you deploy capital within INL as well?
I think most of the discussion around will go over the last several years by regulators and industry participants and clients going back to the earlier question is what impact has it had on market making capabilities across the industry, which is obviously the most important part of our business we're providing liquidity to our clients.
We would take a look at it, if it changed in terms of our activities, proprietary trading we haven't been in that business in a long time, it was never a material driver and so we would look at it and whatever in the best interest of our clients and our shareholders that's how we evaluate it just like we devaluate any rule change.
The good thing about that is it gives us a lots of capacity, and it goes back to when we talk about operating leverage sure it's about expenses it's about capital, but it's positioning the firm in a way that we can respond to an uptick.
But I would wish it for Marty over the years ahead that if he had the chance to deploy capital back to our clients not to return as much to shareholders grow risk weighted assets that actually with the firm has done for the vast majority of the firms history and those are the environments that you know we thrive in and so it was Marty and I'd pass the baton over the next couple of months, I'm hoping he gets to deploy the capital in that way with all of us across the firm.
Well maybe I'll kick off and then I'll turn over to Marty and he can talk more specifically about technology, but I wouldn't say there's been a lack of investment in, I think the way you described it some of the other growth areas, right.
And then within DCM just coming back to some other questions you know had a really terrific year there obviously if the M&A backdrop improves from here that it could be supportive, on the other hand you know higher interest rates you see like my constrain some issuance, I know there is a lot of puts and takes.
You know the debt component of the backlog continues to growth, thatÃÂÃÂs a necessarily forecast this year but the level of client engagement is quite high.
Just two quick questions, one in the investment management, with regards to the flows in liquidity products, I mean youÃÂÃÂve seen those kind of flows pickup in the fourth quarter of last two years, is this just where you saw this quarter again a seasonal effect with regards to liquidity products?
I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
I'll now pass the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, who is also joined by our Deputy CFO, Marty Chavez.
Over his career, Mary held positions of increasing responsibility in investment banking, institutional client services and then most recently as our Chief Information Officer.
Having worked closely with him for over a decade, I have full confidence that Marty will continue that track record as our Chief Financial Officer.
Briefly on the fourth quarter; net revenues were $8.2 billion, net earnings were $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share were $5.08 and annualized return on common equity was 11.4%.
We advise on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter including Procter & Gamble, $12.5 billion merger with beauty business into Coty.
Equity underwriting net revenues up $212 million were down 7% compared to the third quarter as follow-on offerings decreased.
Debt underwriting net revenues decreased 13% to $565 million from robust issuance levels in the third quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in energies ÃÂÃÂ4.6 billion IPO to Soros $1.6 billion high yield bond offering and it seems [indiscernible] $1.2 billion IPO.
Commodities increased significantly during the quarter as higher energy prices drove better market making conditions and more client activity.
Rates were down slightly relative to the third quarter, client activity was solid driven by diverging monetary policies.
This translated into a 6% increase year-over-year excluding DVA gains from 2015 results, given the difficult market conditions in the first quarter of 2016, 6% growth particularly notable.
Equities client execution net revenues were $459 million, down significantly across both derivatives and cash products.
Commissions and fees were $736 million, up slightly relative to the third quarter as global client volumes increased modestly.
Equity security generated net revenues of $1 billion, reflecting corporate performance as well as sales and gains in public equity investments.
On a full year basis, we had $42 billion of long term net inflows primarily driven by fixed income and $52 billion of liquidity product inflows.
Compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits was down 8% for 2016 reflecting the decline in net revenues.
Fourth quarter non-competition expenses were $2.3 billion.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
Hey good morning, Glenn.
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
Yeah, so one thing I really want to point out because I know this question comes up about realizing and better you ask it but everybody asked it realize versus mark.
I think when you say indirect and direct you mean direct obviously weÃÂÃÂve been relatively high tax payer and so tax rates come down.
Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
So as for technology has clients have continued to transact more electronically weÃÂÃÂve invested more heavily in those capabilities, so that we can better serve them.
So I think if you look at history, the rate levels is still pretty low even though the tenner might have moved up a 100 basis points of one point.
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
",46.58,0.6261931
goldmansachs,q1,2017,"Our Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Marty Chavez, will now review the firmÃÂÃÂs results.
Net earnings included a $475 million tax benefit related to a new accounting standard for share-based compensation.
The operating environment in the first quarter was mixed with lower activity in several institutional market making businesses offset in part by generally higher activity in investment banking.
For our investing clients, the opportunity set was negatively affected by lower volatility.
For example within FICC, D10 foreign exchange volatility approached its lowest level in two years for the dollar-euro pair.
Reduced volatility also negatively affected client activity within another macro FICC market, commodities.
For example, realized volatility for the S&P 500 reached its lowest level for first quarter in 50 years.
Not surprisingly, U.S. cash equity volumes were generally down both sequentially and year-over-year; however, other client segments were more active in this environment.
Investment banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.7 billion, 15% higher than the fourth quarter as we saw increases in both M&A and underwriting.
Debt underwriting revenues were up 13% to $636 million and benefited from strong industry-wide leveraged finance and investment grade activity.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter, down 16% sequentially as client activity was low following a relatively active fourth quarter.
Most of our businesses produced lower net revenues quarter over quarter.
Equities client execution net revenues of $552 million were up 20% compared to a weaker fourth quarter, but roughly consistent with the quarterly average for 2016.
The business operated in an environment with global equity market strength but lower volatility.
Securities services generated net revenues of $384 million, down 4% quarter over quarter.
Equities securities generated net revenues of $798 million, reflecting sales, corporate performance and gains in public equity investments.
We have consistently generated roughly $8 billion of revenues in each of the past four quarters despite a variety of different environments.
Second, operating efficiently, which means striking the right balance between addressing challenges and investing in future opportunities.
Good morning, thanks very much.
Then I personally hate this question but IÃÂÃÂm going to ask it anyway, because it doesnÃÂÃÂt make sense to me, but plenty of talk in the market about some version of Glass-Steagall or some greater separation than weÃÂÃÂve already seen with the capital requirements and the regulatory environment.
There is always things that we can do better, and itÃÂÃÂs important to note weÃÂÃÂre constantly analyzing our results with an eye towards continually improving them.
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Okay, but I mean, it does sound like youÃÂÃÂre thinking that there were some positioning issues as opposed to it just being customer flow.
IÃÂÃÂm wondering whether you see any specific events in Q2 that could actually increase volatility from your point of view.
So certainly weÃÂÃÂre all looking at the same thing as we head into the French election next week - volatility, for instance dollar-euro has picked up significantly since intra-quarter, and weÃÂÃÂd also generally see that clarity on outcome increases the probability of action.
Other than that, just IÃÂÃÂll note, which weÃÂÃÂve already discussed, thereÃÂÃÂs often a connection between reasonable levels of volatility around market trends driving risk managers to transact.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures thatÃÂÃÂs posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
IÃÂÃÂll walk you through the first quarter results, then IÃÂÃÂll turn it over to Harvey for some brief comments at the end, then obviously weÃÂÃÂll be happy to answer any questions.
Breaking down the components of investment banking in the first quarter, advisory revenues were $756 million, up 7% relative to the fourth quarter.
Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, down 7% compared to the fourth quarter.
As I mentioned, despite a benign market backdrop, low volatility across many FICC-related products constrained the opportunity set for our clients and reduced activity levels.
In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.7 billion, up 5% sequentially.
Commissions and fees were $738 million, flat with the fourth quarter as activity levels remained generally low.
Moving onto our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the first quarter.
On the Volcker Rule, we applied for and received a five-year extension for substantially all of our remaining covered funds, which totaled approximately $6 billion at the end of the quarter.
In investment management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion.
As we look forward, we remain focused on several operational objectives: first, providing world-class advice and execution services to our global clients and delivering the whole firm to them.
Also, I believe you mentioned $8 billion of annual revenues in FICC, if I heard you right.
The ratios have ticked down 20 or 30 basis points since the end of last year, depending on which ratio youÃÂÃÂre talking about, and really itÃÂÃÂs on increased credit RWAs, which is primarily driven by lending for the advanced approach, and lending and funding transactions for standardized.
It seems like maybe over the past two years, the business has been maybe on a relative basis a bit more challenged, and we can point to a lot of things in terms of the client mix, whether itÃÂÃÂs hedge funds or investment managers, theyÃÂÃÂre facing some pressures.
But just wanted to get a sense - when you guys look at the business and the mix, are you positioned where you want to be, and then when we think about that in terms of the outlook, is there more that can be done on the expense or capital base or do you think that youÃÂÃÂre still--youÃÂÃÂre looking for a positive kind of revenue backdrop with the current mix that you have?
I know thatÃÂÃÂs a lot in there, but just trying to get a sense because it seems like it wasnÃÂÃÂt just one quarter.
Yes, so I think itÃÂÃÂs important to note that weÃÂÃÂre not focusing on revenue share, and while top line revenue and revenue share are among the many factors that we look at, the focus is on serving the clients, our impact and engagement with them, and on returns, so returns, not revenues, and generating strong ROEs over the cycle.
TheyÃÂÃÂre just always really just part of the constant discipline here to look at expenses, and as you know, we have significantly changed that business over the last few years since beginning of 2012 to now headcount, compensation, benefits, risk-weighted assets, balance sheet all down.
Okay, and then maybe as a follow-up, if you can give us the--I donÃÂÃÂt think you guys gave us the fully phased in unit ratios, and I think in the last quarter, maybe a quarter before that, Harvey, you mentioned just in terms of where you think the G-SIB buffer would pan out.
I know everything is kind of potentially in flux when we look at the outlook, but just how youÃÂÃÂre thinking about that.
So IÃÂÃÂve got a couple questions this morning just on 1Q tends to be the highest quarter in FICC, and my thought is, well look, if vol is down so much right now today, as you mentioned thatÃÂÃÂs the biggest driver, do you--as vol increases, do you expect that the VAR productivity could go higher, like it had in prior periods of rising rates?
Then just lastly on the Volcker Rule, Marty, you mentioned that you asked and received the five-year extension here on the $6 billion.
You might be laughing, like whoÃÂÃÂs asking about five years out, but IÃÂÃÂll just ask the obvious question there, but then also how youÃÂÃÂre thinking about redeploying the capital that frees up as these assets roll off.
WeÃÂÃÂd note that some of our competitors had bigger financing businesses and more significant corporate footprints as a result of larger lending books, but again itÃÂÃÂs one quarter and business mix differences might reflect performance, relative performance quarter to quarter, but we believe our model has lots of leverage improving client activity.
ItÃÂÃÂs nice of you to say you donÃÂÃÂt want to give Marty a hard time for the call, but I think this is--in some respects, weÃÂÃÂve had this conversation on and off over the past four and a half years, and I think last year in the third and fourth quarter, where you might have said we outperformed, that wasnÃÂÃÂt a moment of celebration for us, and as Marty said, this isnÃÂÃÂt a moment of bigger concern for us.
Following up, though, on a component there, a couple years ago you guys had made the effort to try to grow out the corporate client base.
Okay, thanks for taking the questions.
Morning, Guy. Okay, so umpteenth question on the FICC thing, and IÃÂÃÂm just going to follow up on a comment that you made, which is we heard several times that obviously clients were less active and that has lots to do with mix, and that makes sense.
But I think I also heard you say that you didnÃÂÃÂt feel like you had navigated some of the currents as effectively as you might have, and I was wondering if you could break down between the areas that you called out as having been headwinds, which were commodities, FX and, I think to a lesser extent, credit, where in particular maybe there were issues with inventory management or positioning, as opposed to just the customer flow.
Is it fake math or good math to kind of compare that $300 million, $320 million to the $900 million of cost saves and think that the message youÃÂÃÂre sending is that maybe a third or so of that $900 million is on the comp line?
I wouldnÃÂÃÂt call out that one in particular, but we look at many things, and since we do have, as you mentioned, a strong tradition of building tools and applying those tools to deliver results for our clients, thatÃÂÃÂs something we intend to continue.
Marty, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of an update on whatÃÂÃÂs going on with the Marcus consumer lending initiative ,so maybe you can give us a sense of where originations are now and how theyÃÂÃÂre tracking relative to your firmÃÂÃÂs initial expectations of a few quarters ago.
If you want to look at the client execution line quarter on quarter, itÃÂÃÂs really about cash and derivatives performance, and then if youÃÂÃÂre looking year-on-year, itÃÂÃÂs really about derivatives.
ItÃÂÃÂs just part of the operating environment, and working with our clients, regulators, peers through the process of the rule making and the implementation is just something that weÃÂÃÂve been doing for a long time and itÃÂÃÂs just part of how the business operates.
If any additional questions arise, please donÃÂÃÂt hesitate to reach out to Dane; otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day and look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in July.
",48.37,0.86908346
goldmansachs,q2,2017,"Good morning, my name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today.
I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2017 Earnings conference call.
This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call.
We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including C.
We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including Syngenta's $43.6 billion sale to ChemChina, HPE's $13.5 billion spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences and Private Bancorp's $5 billion sale to CIBC.
During the second quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs participating in QUALCOMM's $11 billion bond offering in support of its acquisition of NXP.
Equities client execution net revenues of $687 million were up 24% compared to first quarter due to stronger results in cash products.
Commissions and fees were $764 million up 4% versus the first quarter as volumes increased modestly.
Security services generated net revenues of $441 million up 15% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally stronger client activity.
Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3% and finally we repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock for $1.5 billion in the quarter.
For the four quarters CCAR cycle for 2016, we provided shareholders with nearly $7 billion of capital through share buybacks and common stock dividends.
Good morning, Glenn.
Good morning, Michael.
Good morning, Guy. Guy Moszkowski
IÃÂÃÂm kind of sitting back trying to think how much LCR/SRL easing could potentially increase the financing available to clients and therefore kind of boost trading volumes overall market activity.
Good morning Betsy.
Good morning, Marty.
Good morning, Marty.
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2017 earnings conference call.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures thatÃÂÃÂs posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
Taking a step back to review our year-to-date results, we had firmwide net revenues of $15.9 billion, net earnings of $4.1 billion, earnings per diluted share of $9.10 and a return on common equity of 10.1%.
Another area of strength is investment management, where we posted record management and other fees and assets under supervision and investing and lending generated $1.6 billion of revenues in the quarter with net interest income within debt securities and loans reaching more than $400 million.
In addition, our clients place significant value on the firm's long-standing commitment to market making as well as our strength in derivatives.
Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses; net revenues were $3.1 billion in the second quarter down 9% compared to the first quarter.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.2 billion in the second quarter down 31% sequentially as volatility and client conviction remained low and led to weaker client activity quarter-over-quarter.
Now moving to equities, which include equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion up 13% sequentially.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.6 billion in the second quarter.
So, I definitely heard all the commentary on FICC and I think commodities is one of the things that stands out that's makes you different than the others, but maybe we could talk about the mix of clients and how much that adds to may be the differentiated performance that we're seeing meaning you see more volatility dependent right.
Obviously, that's a question on our mind as well as yours and so to step back for a moment, while there are nuances and everyone's franchise is a bit different as we all know, our franchise emphasizes providing liquidity to active asset managers.
Our business starts and ends with them and those communicating with them, coming up with new products, technologies, tools, analytics, workflows and iterating that we have on offering that is what they're looking for and that's something that we're going to continue doing and we're totally committed to it.
What I would say there Glenn is really on predicting when anything will be different than it is just looking back historically one year ago exactly at this time, I don't think any one of us would've predicted the strong client activity, market environment of the second half of 2016.
You mentioned in terms of looking at the business and maybe some of the client gaps the market share.
But I think even in '16 when we look at the global competitors, it seems like the FICC business has been a little bit more challenged.
So, I am just trying to figure out how far along to gain that process is the management team or is the FICC franchise in terms of reassessing whether it's a client, the product mix to try to diversify and broaden some of the growth opportunities?
Well it's a good question and so let's go into some other effects that may be going on here and also caveated by saying that we don't have transparency into our competitor's FICC businesses, but I'll note that historically we'd had strength in derivatives and this was a weak quarter like the first quarter for derivatives.
Also, it's likely that some of our competitors have bigger corporate footprints than we do as well as bigger financing footprints than we do and so while four of our business in FICC has been as I mentioned providing liquidity to active asset managers, it isn't a matter of just focusing on active asset managers and having a leading active manager franchise.
And then just a follow-up I guess on CCAR and just capital priorities, given the combination of some of the maybe challenges on the trading side, but then also just evaluation of the stock, is there anything changed in terms of how much you guys are focused on capital return verses reinvesting in the business, M&A activity and if there is areas I know you guys been active on the asset management side, but anything else on that front?
Sure, so looking at our FICC businesses as we discussed, year-on-year they all declined except for mortgages and sequentially they all declined and while there are nuances, the primary driver across most of the businesses and I'll get to commodities in a moment, the primary driver for the decline sequentially or year-on-year was lower client activity with all the drivers that we discussed, lower volatility, less dispersion, less opportunity set.
Commodities as a story of challenges on all fronts and there it was lower client activity and also a difficult market-making environment as you know in market-making if I could use for a moment a store analogy though is more complex than the typical store, our clients we need to have in our store that the clients are seeking and we need to have a capacity to create the products that the clients are seeking and sometimes clients are also selling us products they go into the store, which is maybe different from a typical store.
As you mentioned it was an environment of higher equity prices and low volatility and then you asked the questions why is this -- how is this different and I would note several things.
And we noticed our market share going up not just with our active manager client, but also the passive managers as for providing capital and equities client execution we observed increased demand around a variety of events.
The European elections also as we noticed last year around the Brexit referendum in addition as it relates to equities client execution we observed a normalization in the markets in Asia.
And to get to another part of your question we are observing the positive results of investing over multiple quarters in both execution and in and in capital commitment and then in addition I would note corporate activity remained healthy and is typically not correlated with the activity of the active manager clients.
And about two-thirds of them roughly our activities that the regulators could undertake that don't require legislative authorization and the report did get a bit more specific on the ratios that you mentioned are particularly SLR and there's certainly been a lot of commentary and research out of the market about what changes to the SLR might create in terms of capacity.
We don't have bar targets and bar is an output of clientÃÂÃÂs activity, client demand for capital as we discussed and as you noted it declined from $64 million to $51 million sequentially, so call it 20% and looking across the product areas, really, it's lower volatility as the main driver in currencies, there's a bit of a positional driver in addition to the ball driver.
There is a lot of reasons for that but really, we just think of it as a business that serves the clients holistically across a number of different products.
But I guess the question is then, how much do you think or are concerned about maybe structural headwinds on the demand side when you have greater transparency in the markets you have pressures on fees and flows on active managers and passives and even exchanges are trying to grab market share from OTC markets.
As for derivatives versus cash, again it wouldn't see it as one or the other why not why not both and of course we're going to continue investing in our historical strength in derivatives and stay with our clients over the long term not just in the quarters where there are extremely active.
So for a particular kind of risk, you could have futures, derivatives, cash, systematic trading strategies, ETFs, and it just goes on and on, and really as opposed to attempting to predict which product format is going to be appealing to the client, I think that would be really brittle to have a prediction and move everything in that direction and really the way we're seeing it, the way we see generally everything is preparing the firm to respond to a variety of different market states and a variety of different client needs.
So, great question Steven, IÃÂÃÂll just note that we don't really - while of course we have all kinds of analytics, we don't really break out the business in that particular way.
I think to go back to that store analogy, there is - well it would be - maybe a wonderful utopian thing to be able to operate the two and say one is client activity and one is when it navigating the markets.
As for the rest of the FICC businesses, it really was a story of lower client activity very good.
ThatÃÂÃÂs a great question, so as you noted year-to-date our volumes are strong and outperforming and of course the quarter is important and useful and standard are construct.

goldmansachs,q3,2017,"I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2017 Earnings conference call.
This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs.
Revenue strength in investment banking and investment management helped to offset weaker FICC performance.
As Harvey discussed at a recent conference, we had detailed plans across each of our businesses to drive stronger client relationships and shareholder value creation in the current operating environment.
As it relates specifically to this quarterÃÂÃÂs performance, revenues increased 6% sequentially and 2% year-over-year.
Investment banking produced third quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 4% compared to the second quarter including strong results in advisory.
Debt underwriting revenues of $674 million included strong acquisition finance activity.
Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked 1st in worldwide common-stock offerings, and also had a leading position in leveraged finance.
Despite the increase, third quarter results still represented a bottom decile performance.
Equities client execution net revenues of $584 million were down 15% compared to the second quarter.
Security services generated net revenues of $403 million, down 9% sequentially, reflecting typical second quarter seasonality.
As mentioned earlier, compensation and benefits expense for the year to date which include salary, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 40%.
As you probably know, Dane will become the firmÃÂÃÂs new Global Head of Human Capital Management in January.
How much do you think of that balance sheet is relationship lending versus straight investment versus more of an asset management like revenue?
So, just -- not to harp, but I wanted to stand a little bit on BetsyÃÂÃÂs question about expected loss through the cycle because one of the push backs that I had when I spoken to investors about your growth opportunities is that the implied margins on the loan asset balances donÃÂÃÂt seem to many people like they really incorporate sort of full through the cycle loss potential.
And thereÃÂÃÂs also a connection to our bar number which declined a bit, $4 million sequentially and the drivers in the bar number going down were all continuing to decline across products but also reduced commodity positions.
And since I was the guy who gave you such a hard time about the buyback disclosure last quarter, I should certainly thank you for doing it now.
I was hoping you can just shed some light on what drove the decline in management fees linked quarter, just given the strong equity markets that we saw and the pretty health -- continued healthy increasing AUM.
And then, just thinking longer term in relation to the $1 billion revenue target to business investment management where weÃÂÃÂve seen pretty substantial secular headwinds and fee pressures, and IÃÂÃÂve got a lot of questions from clients as to whatÃÂÃÂs giving you guys the confidence that you can hit that $1 billion incremental revenue target.
With the federal reserve moving into a full unwind next year, have you guys mapped out what the volatility could do because of this changing position by the federal reserve and what it might do for the revenues for your FICC business?
ThereÃÂÃÂs about a $1.3 billion decline in fixed income so you kind of have offsetting effect with those two things, which is letting your overall revenue still grow this year.
Do you know the capital dollar amounts were only up less than $2 billion year-on-year starting points or really increased by more than that, is it just the ratios are higher simply?
Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures thatÃÂÃÂs posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
IÃÂÃÂll walk you through the third quarter and the year-to-date results; then, IÃÂÃÂll be happy to answer any questions.
Year-to-date, our firm-wide revenues are up 8% or $1.8 billion versus the same period last year, reflecting a broad contribution across most of our businesses.
As a result of revenue growth and expense discipline, our pre-tax earnings are up 16% to $8 billion and our ROE is 160 basis points higher at 10.3% for the first nine months of the year.
Breaking down the components of investment banking in the third quarter, advisory revenues were $911 million, up 22% compared to the second quarter as deal closings accelerated.
Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.1 billion in the third quarter, up 2% compared to the second quarter, reflecting a recovery in FICC performance.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the third quarter, up 25% sequentially.
Now moving to equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.7 billion, down 12% sequentially.
Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.9 billion in the third quarter.
Given our continued efforts to expand our lending footprint, loans receivable were the biggest growth driver, up $8 billion quarter-over-quarter to $61 billion.
In investment management, we reported third quarter net revenue of $1.5 billion, flat with the second quarter.
When we think about the net interest income and are investing in lending line; that has grown significantly over time, and we see it as a stable and growing revenue source.
Maybe first question, just on investment banking, the results came in strong, you mentioned on the M&A side some deals closing and then, you also just mentioned the pipeline down, just any context around that?
So, as I mentioned, Mike, the backlog is down sequentially and down year-to-date, and thatÃÂÃÂs just natural side effect of the strong closings that we had in the third quarter; some of those deals had actually been in the backlog for a couple of quarters.
I know, thereÃÂÃÂs still a lot of shifting strategies in the industry, in conversations, but any kind of indication on how you think that impacts on the industry and you guys, either from a research standpoint, trading standpoint or market share?
You mentioned a little bit of detail within the loan growth this quarter on an earlier question.
So, on the $5 billion of revenue targets, itÃÂÃÂs important to emphasize again that they donÃÂÃÂt depend on any improvement in the underlying market conditions or any change in regulation.
And we called out in our discussions in September the various parts of that market, which weÃÂÃÂve talked about are private wealth management business, GS Select, institutional lending of various kinds.
And internally, as you would expect, weÃÂÃÂve had growth initiatives since forever, and youÃÂÃÂve seen some of the results of those, whether itÃÂÃÂs in asset management or in our debt underwriting business or growing our asset management business.
Well, we definitely are taking that on and going back to what we described in September, there is a breakdown, various aspects of the revenue opportunity as well as balance sheet and capital against it.
So for instance being able to do these simulations of our balance sheet and income statement and cash flows several months, 18 months into the future is an important part of how we make decisions and not really seeing it is something that we break out, specifically as a cost and as a cost that would be reduced but certainly IÃÂÃÂm happy to say that our focus as just did beyond the implementing of the regulations, which is something we will always do as they arise to growth.
I know, weÃÂÃÂve got -- I think you laid out $28 billion of loan balances.
And again, as with all aspects of what we set out for you and for the market, itÃÂÃÂs really -- it bottoms up looking at the activities where the businesses, where these activities are going to occur.
But, as I said at the outset, I think if we step back and look at the first nine months of this year in FICC and compare it to the first nine months of last year, you see something different that you couldnÃÂÃÂt otherwise piece together, which is, if you look at the delta in FICC, half of that decline -- and so itÃÂÃÂs 23% decline, nine months on nine months, half of it is attributable to commodities inventory; and of that amount, half of that occurred in the second quarter.
How do you -- how do we kind of I guess try to arms around, do you have a thought on if the SLRs changed, would the tier 1 leverage also change, therefore freeing up some capital or balance sheet, or do you think that remains?
And as you know, we and many others welcome the initiatives and the detail of the first and second treasury reports that there -- the potential tailwinds, they are not baked into our $5 billion annual revenue plan.
Going to the second part of your question on the investment management opportunities that we outlined, which was as we said a $1 billion annual revenue opportunity.
IÃÂÃÂm just wondering, if you can give us some insight in how youÃÂÃÂre thinking about the need to focus more on some of the growth opportunities which maybe you had, not emphasized as much given your continued strong capital discipline.
So, also in the third quarter, as the GSIB buffer, weÃÂÃÂre again in that 3% range and itÃÂÃÂs something that we look at every day and work with divisional leaders as we see opportunities to have a strong balance sheet and capital and deploy it and invest in our business and long-term growth.
So, we highlighted for you in the growth initiatives on annual revenue opportunity of $500 million related to PWM and GS Select together.
ItÃÂÃÂs too early to give you progress but it is a part of the initiatives that we outlined, which right now we are aggregating under PWM -- PWM and GS Select together, $500 million revenue opportunity, $11 billion of balance sheet over three years and the implied the yield is evident from that.
So, we do create lotÃÂÃÂs and lotÃÂÃÂs of contingency plans and so looking at what the Fed has said, as you know theyÃÂÃÂve been very specific, theyÃÂÃÂve given us $10 billion a month and then thatÃÂÃÂs going to increase every three months by $10 billion, and so it gets to $50 billion and letting assets roll off that redemption from their balance sheet and theyÃÂÃÂve given us the mix between treasuries and agencies.
Then my second question is, if you look at the seasonal progression of that comp ratio, given that you do have this investment lending gains your revenues are still kind of at the same level you had last year.
As for the comp ratio, of course we -- itÃÂÃÂs an important part of our business and we put a lot of time and energy into considering it and setting it appropriately.

goldmansachs,q4,2017,"I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures thatÃÂÃÂs posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.
Potential benefits could take many forms including heightened M&A activity, increased financing volumes, or the most important indirect benefit to our business, economic growth.
Despite the fourth quarter charge, the direct benefits from forward EPS and ROE accretion, coupled with the potential for several indirect tailwinds are material, long-term positive for shareholders.
We were able to post these strong results despite the industry-wide headwinds, facing one of our businesses, FICC, and despite continued investments in future revenue opportunities that has not yet contributed meaningfully to earnings.
Continued strength in global equity and credit markets coincided with lower levels of market volatility and client trading activity.
Three of our four business segments including Investment Banking, Investment Management, and Investing & Lending produced solid net revenue growth and led to an overall increase in the firmÃÂÃÂs revenues.
Equity underwriting net revenues of $460 million more than doubled compared to the third quarter, driven by an increase in follow-on offerings including our role as sole arranger into ToshibaÃÂÃÂs ÃÂÃÂ¥600 billion private placement.
Debt underwriting net revenues increased 35% to $909 million and included significant contributions from leveraged finance activity.
This growth happened despite our smaller lending footprint because we identified it as a strategic priority where we saw an opportunity to grow share, invested continuously over a number of years and executed relentlessly for the benefit of our clients and shareholders.
This strong performance reflects our continued focus on building long-term client relationships and our ongoing investment in talent and capabilities.
Looking forward, our Investment Banking backlog increased versus the third quarter, driven by announced M&A volumes.
Most of our businesses were impacted by low volatility across global markets, which affected client activity.
A variety of factors including reduced volatility and lower client activity which particularly affected G10 currencies contributed to the decline.
Mortgages, although a smaller business, increased significantly versus last year, reflecting improved performance in commercial and residential mortgages.
And we believe as we continue to improve our connectivity with clients, we can drive meaningfully better performance going forward.
Lastly, securities services generated relatively stable net revenues of $1.6 billion as higher client balances were offset by a mix shift in short covering to more liquid securities.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.2 billion, reflecting corporate performance as well as sales and gains in public equity investments.
Our Investing & Lending balance sheet ended the quarter at $120 billion, up 4% or $4 billion versus last quarter, driven by continued growth and real estate, private wealth and consumer loans.
Our net interest income within debt securities was approximately $1.8 billion for the year.
With respect to debt I&L, the recent expansion of our lending activities positions the firm with $2 billion of run rate net interest income as we start 2018.
Compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior equity awards and other items such benefits was up 2% for 2017, which was 300 basis points lower than the increase in net revenues.
The increase versus the third quarter was driven primarily by a $127 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable fund, higher expenses related to consolidated investments and higher consulting fees.
The first driver relates to our investment in Marcus; second, were expenses associated with investments that need to be consolidated in our balance sheet for accounting purposes; and third, were higher technology and consulting costs to support both regulatory implementation efforts and our ongoing focus on improving efficiency and scale throughout our businesses.
Our reported effective tax rate for the year was 61.5% including the $4.4 billion tax charge, which was partially offset by a $719 million benefit related to employee equity compensation.
Our fourth quarter tax rate reflected $223 million of this benefit, primarily from the delivery of certain prior year equity awards in December.
For the first quarter of 2018, assuming current stock price levels, we estimate the equity compensation related accounting benefit will be approximately $175 million.
Just how are you guys thinking about your lower tax rate in terms of either reinvesting in the business, so basically like the expense outlook, as you look into 2018 or 2019 or how much will it drop to the bottom-line?
Your next question is from the line of Matt OÃÂÃÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
And I think IÃÂÃÂve heard you say that youÃÂÃÂd like to do more trading with corporate clients where youÃÂÃÂre -- itÃÂÃÂs kind of a mix issue when it comes to the trading results, Goldman versus peers.
I have just a slightly different way of asking that question, but on your outlook where you gave your three-year forward revenue potential growth initiatives.
Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
Yes. We generally notice that at low levels, for instance of interest rates, but also at low level of volatility, itÃÂÃÂs -- weÃÂÃÂll see this effect, bid offer compression.
Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Excluding the one-time tax charge, fourth quarter net earnings were $2.5 billion and EPS was $5.68.
And with these headwinds, we concentrated on serving our clients, rolling out our growth initiatives, and investing to drive our business forward.
Conversely, in Institutional Client Services and FICC in particular, revenues declined as the business continued to operate in a low volatility, low activity environment.
And as I will talk about later, we are making significant engineering investments to further expand our client franchise, grow revenues, and transform the long-term earnings profile of the firm.
In the fourth quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2.1 billion, 19% higher than the third quarter, as a significant pickup in underwriting more than offset a decline in M&A.
Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 55% sequentially as equity issuance improved and we participated in numerous large transactions around the world.
For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7.4 billion, up 18% from 2016 on increases in both financial advisory and underwriting.
Net revenues were $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, down 24% compared to the third quarter amid lower volumes in a variety of markets and continued low volatility.
For the full year, ICS generated $11.9 billion of net revenues, down 18% compared to 2016, also driven by lower volatility in client activity and a particularly challenging backdrop for our commodities franchise.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1 billion in the fourth quarter, down significantly versus the third quarter, reflecting a continued challenging operating environment.
For the full year, FICC client execution net revenues were $5.3 billion, translating into a 30% year-over-year decline.
In equities, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion, down 18% sequentially.
Relative to the third quarter, equities client execution net revenues were down significantly on lower results in both cash and derivatives.
For the year, equities client execution net revenues were $2 billion, down 7%, driven by lower derivatives performance.
Collectively, these activities produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter.
In Investment Management, we produced fourth quarter net revenues of $1.7 billion, our second best quarterly performance.
For 2017, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year, largely driven by growth in management and other fees on higher assets.
These investments will allow us to leverage our intellectual capital in more impactful ways, to evolve and be a disruptor in new and existing markets and will affect all of our businesses.
As we look forward to 2018, given the positive backdrop for investing further in our franchise and the impact of tax legislation on our capital ratios, we do not expect to use all of our 2017 CCAR cycle authorization.
But to talk a bit more about our debt underwriting business, as we said, record in many ways, not only league tables, also revenues full year on the quarter.
I love dashboards and those are going be metrics of all kinds, including the capital because of course weÃÂÃÂre changing from a -- where weÃÂÃÂve been in the past few years.
Now, we see these opportunities for growth, high marginal ROEs and of course we prefer all day to invest in these opportunities that are in our business compared to buying back our stock above book value.
But, I guess, I am trying to get a feel for kind of the frequency of tough years historically versus other FICC businesses.
And as you know, in our growth plans that weÃÂÃÂve been talking about, there is a component of the $5 billion annual revenue opportunity developing over the next three years, a $250 million component, which is expanding our corporate franchise in both foreign exchange and commodities.
Well, to step back, weÃÂÃÂre making progress on all of the growth initiatives that we outlined, deploying balance sheet, growing deposits, AUS, hiring employees into FICC, improving market share in FICC and equities, and specifically increasing the mandates from this joint venture between investment banking and trading.
And also, one thing that we know from having seen the cycles many times is that when we start making this progress in market share, it actually needs a better activity environment for the penetration to flow through to revenues.
And also, given the one-time effect of tax legislation that we just went through our financials in the fourth quarter, thought the actual payments happen over eight years, we are going to be focused on having those capital ratios be robust in the next few quarters.
But rather than look at third quarter or fourth quarter, much more relevant for your analysis and for the way weÃÂÃÂre thinking about the business to look at full year.
And so, full year, itÃÂÃÂs up 5%, in line with the revenue growth and that was all deliberate.
And itÃÂÃÂs something that we expect and embrace and weÃÂÃÂre investing for growth and pivoting to executing on the growth plan and delivering earnings growth that non-comp growth proceeds revenue generation.
And I was just wondering should we expect that that could keep going in say a 5% revenue growth environment like what you had last year, should we expect that the comp ratio would come down again meaningfully or with the acceleration of some of the investments in the initiatives that youÃÂÃÂve laid out.
So, one of the many things weÃÂÃÂre doing on this front and itÃÂÃÂs one of the topics that I mentioned when I talked about how our various engineering activities are transforming all of the businesses of the firm not confined to any one business.
If you compare full year 2017 to full year 2016, one-third of the decline in FICC revenues is attributable to our commodities business.
",43.06,0.81917024
goldmansachs,q1,2018,"Better growth prospects are supporting central bank efforts to reduce stimulus which has been a primary factor driving the below average market volatility seen in recent years.
Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.8 billion, 16% lower than a very robust fourth quarter, which was our strongest in over ten years.
Equity underwriting net revenues of $410 million declined 11% driven by lower industry volumes.
Debt underwriting net revenues were $797 million, the second best quarter ever following last quarterÃÂÃÂs record.
Growing debt underwriting has been a long-term priority for the firm and we expect our strong M&A franchise will continue to support robust contribution from acquisition-related financings.
Performance was supported by better prospects for global growth and higher market volatility.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2.1 billion in the first quarter, more than doubling fourth quarter levels reflecting a better operating environment and our efforts to strengthen client relationships.
We saw higher sequential performance across all five of our global fixed income businesses as higher client activity drove a broader opportunity set despite a continued competitive environment with relatively tight bid ask spreads.
We also saw increased activity in areas where we have historical strength including higher activity in derivatives and structured transactions as clients sought to access emerging trends or hedge risks.
Equities Client Execution net revenues of $1.1 billion rose significantly, driving our highest quarterly performance in three years on stronger results in both cash and derivatives.
Security Services net revenues of $432 million rose 6% on higher client balances.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.1 billion, reflecting net gains from private equities driven by company-specific events and corporate performance.
Our global equity portfolio was $23 billion at quarter end and remains well diversified with over 900 different investments.
Net revenues from debt securities and loans were robust $1 billion.
Results included over $550 million of net interest income, which continues to grow as we seek to increase more recurring revenue streams.
Our long-term vision for markets is to create the leading platform for millions of consumers to take control of their financial lives offering personalized products to save and borrow better simple, transparence and provide value to customers.
We produced record revenues in the first quarter driven by our diversified global asset management business and differentiated private wealth management franchise.
Net revenues were $1.8 billion including relatively stable management and other fees.
Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.5 trillion, up $4 billion versus the fourth quarter driven by $13 billion of long-term net inflows across fixed income and equity partially offset by $5 billion of liquidity product outflows and $4 billion of market depreciation.
Regarding our $5 billion in growth initiatives, we track our progress in a detailed and comprehensive way mapping not just the specific revenues generated from each initiative, but many key performance indicators that will provide insight into our progress.
We also continue to emphasize producing higher revenues from more recurring sources such as Investment Management, and Lending generating significant operating leverage and diversifying the long-term earnings profile of the firm.
ItÃÂÃÂs ÃÂÃÂ you also referenced Bloomberg Trade Book which brought on 1300 new clients and thatÃÂÃÂs got some revenue runrate associated with it and weÃÂÃÂve been onboarding low touch and quant clients in connection with the new product services and platforms weÃÂÃÂve been developing.
So curious how we should think about the opportunity set for Goldman, especially growing some of the lower ROE businesses to the extent leverage is no longer a constraint?
Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

So the $50 million this quarter relate to the revenue recognition accounting change, should think thatÃÂÃÂs maybe a low number moving forward, just assuming revenues in areas like M&A advisory, move higher?
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures thatÃÂÃÂs posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website www.gs.com.
During the first quarter, the positive outlook for global growth translated into improved corporate and investor confidence and subsequently solid activity across the firm, particularly in our Investment Banking and Market Making businesses.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, Investment Banking, FICC, Equities, Investing & Lending and Investment Management, each produced net revenue growth with four of the five increasing 18% or more.
While itÃÂÃÂs impossible to predict the future, we remain cautiously optimistic that many of the broader drivers underpinning the solid start to the year, healthy economic growth, relatively positive investor sentiment and the emergence of new market trends can remain in place.
We are pleased with our improved performance in the quarter as it demonstrates the earnings power of our diversified franchise and shows what is possible with modest improvements in the environment and client activity and we believe there is room for additional revenue and earnings growth as we further diversify our global franchise across a broader client base with an expanded suite of products and services.
The improvement in FICC was also evident on a year-over-year basis with a significant increase in currencies reflecting strong performance in emerging markets, as well as significantly better results in commodities and credit.
We are pleased to see our FICC business improve versus a difficult 2017, which we believe in part represents our continued efforts to expand and diversify our global client franchise.
Turning to Equities, net revenues for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, up 69% sequentially as equity market volatility rebounded globally from record lows driving higher client activity, and the broader opportunity set.
Higher non-compensation expenses versus the first quarter of last year reflects both higher client activity and our investments in future growth.
Our balance sheet was $974 billion, up 6% versus last quarter driven by increased client activity and demand for our balance sheet.
Given current capital levels and the opportunities we see to support our client franchise, we do not expect to execute share repurchases in the second quarter and will use earnings to support future investments.
We have been transparent our growth plans and there is a clear demand from clients for our balance sheet, which provides an opportunity to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders.
Looking forward, we continue to make significant investments in our future to deepen and expand our client franchise and drive growth in each of our businesses.
The vol spike, particularly at the beginning of February was a positive contributor to the EquitiesÃÂÃÂ P&L, but again client activity was the major driver and it would have been a strong quarter without the long volatility benefits.
The performance was strong across flow and structured products, across cash and derivatives, across geographies, and all the business lines when delta derivatives and prime there was really broad based improvement where the volatility created a robust market-making backdrop and the clients were active and we executed well.
Of course, we will see how itÃÂÃÂs going to evolve and all of this has to ÃÂÃÂ how the businesses evolve and responses that we make in demand from the clients is a dynamic process.
Based on the proposal, we would expect stress capital buffer to be the binding constraint and we will continue what weÃÂÃÂve been doing for a long time now which is dynamically allocating our scarce resources, optimizing under all of these constraints as they evolve with the goal always of growing the franchise driving returns.
For instance, sales in the private portfolio, but really the key to it is that we have [attractive] [ph] sourcing mechanism and itÃÂÃÂs finding great businesses and working with them to operate them and make them better and of course, thatÃÂÃÂs been driving not only the results you seen in this quarter and prior quarters, the long-term book value for us.
I called out the inflows in our Investment Management business and also to say a little bit on Marcus, the funded loan balance is about $2.4 billion, originations through the end of the first quarter life-to-date approximately $3 billion and you also know of the announcement of Clarity MoneyÃÂÃÂs ÃÂÃÂ after the acquisition of Clarity Money, which closed on Friday and there Clarity Money is a digital app that aligns with what weÃÂÃÂve been doing already in Marcus.
Marty, just, I guess, a question on client content and activity levels both in banking and trading, like the industry, we always have kind of a seasonal lift in the first quarter.
WeÃÂÃÂve gotten the tax reform and rising rates and on the flip side, weÃÂÃÂve got some trade work and churns, flatter yield curves, so where do you see if there is things that you can point to in the business metrics, client balances activity?
Whether itÃÂÃÂs in banking or trading that makes you think that the ÃÂÃÂ beyond potential that you are better this year over the next couple of years, thatÃÂÃÂs different versus the past year is where weÃÂÃÂve seen kind of the 1Q bounce and then back to kind of muted activity levels?
Michael, one way to think about it is to compare this quarter to the last time we had results in both FICC and Equities at these levels.
Just wanted to get a sense when you look at kind of the demand for the balance sheet and the opportunities for growth, whether itÃÂÃÂs on the institutional ÃÂÃÂ the trading side or what you are dealing like the lending side.
And of course there is uncertainties and itÃÂÃÂs evolving and dynamic and there is going to be a lot of discussion next ÃÂÃÂ on those sixty days that the Fed has invited with the industry on stressed capital buffer and so there will likely be some evolution there as the rule makes its way into the final state.
And so, all of these things are moving and when we gave the growth plan, and the $5 billion to $6 billion expectation of share repurchases per CCAR cycle, we very much had what we thought possible for the stress capital buffer proposal in our minds when we proposed and adopted our internal capital management planning, which ensures that we are dynamically managing capital moving it around on behalf of the clients to where the highest return opportunities are for our shareholders.
I want to follow-up on the Investment Banking piece, stronger than what we are seeing at peers and especially in the DCM, debt capital markets area, you alluded to the share gains there apart from some of the build out in recent years.
And you are seeing the results of that and the consistent execution across weeks, months, quarters, years in building that business and there in that business, you saw in this quarter what is the key driver and the differentiator of the business compared to the debt underwriting businesses in the peer group, which is that we identified our core strengths which we all know in M&A and we built the debt underwriting business around that core strength.
The strategy over this period and continuing to now has remained stable which is giving advice, giving our clients access to capital markets and then applying everything we know and do about risk management to this business and doing it all in the context of strong franchise.
But what I will say in this early quarter, the second quarter after we laid out the growth plan, itÃÂÃÂs the revenue is tracking according to the internal goals that we set for ourselves.
Whether itÃÂÃÂs Investment Management components of the $1billion growth initiatives in Investment Management, about a third of it is in our Ayco Executive Counseling business, the digital platforms there in markets there.
IÃÂÃÂd expect that we are highly likely to continue with bolt-on acquisitions weÃÂÃÂve found in our Marcus business, but in many other places, thatÃÂÃÂs building it on our own allows us to deliver best-in-class experiences.
ItÃÂÃÂs a high-class problem to have, this taking capital allocation and while itÃÂÃÂs important to have the excess capacity and thatÃÂÃÂs why we highlighted that $5 billion to $6 billion expectation, if the demand from the clients continues to be strong, that is really the principal driver and when we see that demand and the opportunity to deploy capital with high ROEs thatÃÂÃÂs what we are going to do.
And we broke out some of the drivers in the year-on-year increase and outlined $100 million of that year-on-year increase is related not only to building out the Marcus platform, the market development of it, but also relating to investing in our investment entities that are consolidated on the balance sheet and therefore their expenses will also show up in non-comps.
ItÃÂÃÂs the year-on-year driver in global credit was increased client activity.
But really itÃÂÃÂs improved client activity and also I would call out within that in structure trading, particularly notable contributor to the year-on-year increase.
In rates, if we look at the sequential change in the rates business, itÃÂÃÂs definitely up sequentially as you know and there it was really client activity-driven and clients responding to Central Bank activity.
As for our ability to serve our clients make markets for them have the right amount of inventory on the balance sheet and manage all of those risks, itÃÂÃÂs dynamic.
But when we think about the $1 billion of ÃÂÃÂ it sounds like loan growth within Marcus alone this quarter.
I think it could $1 billion loan growth in Marcus have actually in the quarter, itÃÂÃÂs $0.5 billion.
And then, second, when you guys talked about your Equities trading business, Equities Client Execution was quite strong as you've indicated and I think you highlighted that the cash and derivatives area was particularly good.

goldmansachs,q2,2018,"I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.
Stronger revenues across our businesses and positive operating leverage drove first half ROTE of roughly 15%, our best first half performance in 9 years.
During second quarter, we saw solid client engagement across our businesses with positive macro trends supporting corporate and investor activity, with the backdrop of rising U.S. rates and better visibility on QE in Europe, trends emerged across a variety of markets and asset classes.
Financial advisory revenues were $804 million, up 37% relative to the first quarter reflecting higher completed M&A volumes.
Results were our third highest on record and up 3% versus the first quarter as strength in equity offerings offset lower debt underwriting.
Debt underwriting net revenues were robust $752 million, down 6% from last quarter.
Debt underwriting performance this quarter included significant contributions from acquisition-related activity.
Our Investment Banking backlog increased significantly versus the first quarter to reach a record level driven by M&A and underwriting.
While performance declined from a solid first quarter, client engagement remained healthy and the overall backdrop remained constructive for our market-making franchises.
Rates was modestly lower sequentially as lower revenues in Europe were partially offset by solid performance in the U.S. as clients responded to central bank activity.
Commissions and fees net revenues of $763 million declined 7% on modestly lower market volumes across regions.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.3 billion reflecting net gains from private equities driven by company-specific events and corporate performance.
Roughly half of the increase versus last year was good expense growth including approximately $175 million from investments to drive growth including markets and our consolidated investments and to build scale through technology.

Ladies and gentlemen, this does include the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2018 earnings conference call.
I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation expenses, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, supplementary leverage ratio and stress capital buffer and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures thatÃÂÃÂs posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website www.gs.com.
Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2 billion, 14% higher than the first quarter driven by robust growth in advisory and continued strong and stable performance in underwriting.
Equity underwriting net revenues of $489 million increased 19% to the highest level in 3 years as our volume growth outpaced the industry.
Turning to Equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion, down 18% versus the strong first quarter as equity market volumes and volatility declined.
Equities Client Execution net revenues of $691 million declined from the first quarter, which was our highest quarterly performance in 3 years.
Over the past 3 years, we have had a balanced franchise with derivatives and cash each contributing roughly half of Equities Client Execution revenues.
Moving to Investing & Lending, collectively, these activities produced net revenues of $1.9 billion in the second quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, our equities I&L businesses generated $2.4 billion of net revenues, roughly 65% from corporate investments and 35% from real estate.
Moving to Investment Management, we produced record net revenues in the second quarter driven by strong incentive fee realizations and solid contributions from both our asset management and PWM businesses.
Now let me turn to expenses, we continued to monitor and manage our overall expense base with an emphasis on paying for performance to attract and retain the best talent and spending to support our clients while investing in technology and infrastructure to grow the firm for the future.
The level of our share repurchase plan reflects our capital position post-tax reform and our desire to invest in the growth of our client franchise.
Before taking questions a few closing thoughts, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2018, including our execution on our $5 billion revenue growth initiatives.
And finally, we are making solid progress across a variety of lending initiatives, including expanding our customer base of Marcus borrowers and depositors, growing our lending to PWM clients, and continuing to prudently deploy capital to our institutional lending and financing business.
In conclusion, when we think about our ability to drive value, we are encouraged by roughly 15% returns year-to-date and to further benefit from our growth plans giving us increased confidence in our ability to deliver attractive long-term returns for shareholders.
Question on the I&L front I know it was a great private equity quarter, but a lot of growth is still being fueled on the I&L side, you pointed out the, call it, $2.5 billion of run-rate NII.
To add on to that question is just I think you have been there for a long time and you are increasing efforts, but it feels early days in the growth of private credit in general and does it feel like the opportunities are accelerating there and are you constrained at all by your structure meaning in the old days you might raise a big fund like some of the old [indiscernible] but Volcker limits your participation like you just put on balance sheet is the same capital treatment, I am just curious if you could talk towards that?
Maybe first question, just on the backdrop you mentioned pipeline at an all time high and you have got the tax reform, but then you get the trade stuff and so I just wanted to get some color on what you are seeing from clients both on the banking and the training front?
And then just as a follow-up, just want to get your perspective, like this is the second quarter where revenue growth has been strong, you guys produced operating leverage, ROE is year-to-date 14, TE is 15%, but valuation, it doesnÃÂÃÂt seem like you get much credit, is there ÃÂÃÂ is it more just consistency over time, do you think they will follow through and the growth in book value will eventually deliver or from a disclosure standpoint and maybe some of the newer businesses whether itÃÂÃÂs on the lending side, is there more that maybe could be down or that you guys are looking into to maybe improve disclosure and transparency?
Well, certainly Michael, we are leading in running the business for the long-term and we know that that the importance obviously of delivering revenue and earnings growth, hence the growth strategy that we outlined for the market is driving more recurring fee based revenue banding products and services and broadening the client base and thatÃÂÃÂs something that you can see in our results and itÃÂÃÂs something that we are going to continue to work on.
So just to have follow-up on operating leverage, it was pretty impressive in the first half as you said revenue growth of 22% in pre-tax even high at 33%, while all investing for growth, question is how should we think about operating leverage for the full year, I guess the comp ratio was down 200 bps for the quarter, is that a good way to think about the full year or should we be thinking about more in efficiency ratio, just we would like to get more color from you?
The comp to net revenue ratio, and as you know, Christian, is 39% is our best estimate at this point for the full year.
So, I am not going to breakout the percentage change other than to say that it was strong growth on the quarter with significance on the quarter and not only as I mentioned was it a record for the overall banking segment in backlog, itÃÂÃÂs a record M&A or financial advisory backlog and underwriting is at the second highest level ever.
Well, we are certainly seeing all kinds of trends at play and you mentioned some of them, we have seen resilient growth across many economies, rising U.S. rates, do the unwinds, tax reform behind us and therefore a lot more clarity on its stronger U.S. labor market, CEO confidence, GDP growth, all of those things are part of the macro backdrop and the momentum feels good.
I have one follow-up question and then one other question, on the follow-up I know we talked already about the comp ratio and I know in your commentary you indicated, look thatÃÂÃÂs going to be a function of revenues, but also profitability, so my question is around profitability, are you kind of suggesting to us in that commentary that you really donÃÂÃÂt want to go below 12% ROE, because we kept the 41, it would have been below that?
Quick one on Marcus, thanks for the increased disclosure especially on the refreshed FICO, thatÃÂÃÂs helpful, I know itÃÂÃÂs a new business for you guys, but I definitely appreciate the attempts to improve and enhance the disclosures there.
Good morning, Guy. Before I ask a question, I just ÃÂÃÂ I know he is not on the call, but I just thought in case he listens to it later or something, I think really we all owe a hat tip to Lloyd for his leadership over these 12 years through good times and bad.
Equities, similarly I mentioned 100 basis point expansion in wallet share since 2016, up 140, to be a little bit more precise and thatÃÂÃÂs with those systematic in quant clients and half of that progress has happened this year to give you a flavor of some of the KPIs, but we know that the market is looking for the mark-to-market.
Just on something that is related, but is going to be maybe a little nitpicky given that itÃÂÃÂs a quarter, but I am just curious in the equities business, which you pointed to, the fact is you were flat year-over-year in the second quarter at a time when your peer group that has reported so far were up on average I think so far about 20% year-over-year, granted there is 10 point sensitivity to these types of analyses, but I am just wondering were there any particular things that might have held you back in the equities business this quarter as we try to think about how we kind of annualize and go forward?
We have a leading prime platform and that business also had as you know in the second quarter of last year strong performance, solid performance and so the comp was tough.
I mentioned one of those in specific, but I am happy to go into any of them if you would like, but letÃÂÃÂs say starting with commissions and fees, I will note that those revenues were stable and again it is just one quarter versus the second quarter with commission rates going down.
Good morning, Jim. First, maybe just on follow-up on Marcus, I thought it was interesting that you are looking to expand in the UK, just what kind of drove that decision and could we see follow-through with perhaps a lending product in the UK or do we see other markets, do you enter other markets, how do we think about where thatÃÂÃÂs heading?
And maybe just a question on the SCB impact, obviously itÃÂÃÂs as you pointed out year-to-year itÃÂÃÂs going to be very different, is there other way if it stays as the economy continues to get better and the test seems to get tougher and tougher, is there a way to reduce stressed volatility in your view or do you think there might be changes to the test, so that is still a pretty big step up to the SCB from the prior buffer, I am just trying to think through that your model and some of the pure play investment banks tend to get ÃÂÃÂ seem to get harder, letÃÂÃÂs say harder in the stress test, is there anything you see thatÃÂÃÂs sort of easy to do that could help alleviate some of that or is it just sort of you got up that year-to-year?
Good morning Marty, I guess question here on Clarity Money and just what you guys have done since the acquisition, the strategy to drive more customers into the app and then just how we should think about that in terms of kind of broader consumer finance wealth management growth especially as you had more products of the offering?

A 25-year veteran at Goldman Sachs, Stephen has held numerous leadership positions, beginning his career in Investment Banking and then on to Fixed Income, next heading our Financing Group in Investment Banking and later serving as our head of firm-wide strategy.
Adding MartyÃÂÃÂs deep understanding of technology and the firmÃÂÃÂs balance sheet to AshokÃÂÃÂs market expertise and JimÃÂÃÂs thorough knowledge of our client needs gives us the right mix of talent to lead the Securities Division.
During the third quarter, while we saw quieter levels of client activity in certain businesses, several positive macro trends continued, including healthy global economic growth, particularly in the U.S.; strong CEO confidence; open financing markets; rising equity market valuations; and stable credit spreads.
Equity underwriting net revenues of $432 million decreased 12% sequentially amid lower follow-on volumes but more than doubled versus a year ago as IPO activity accelerated, supported by strong activity in Asia.
We also ranked number one in global IPOs. Debt underwriting net revenues were $632 million, down 16% from last quarter amid lower industry volumes.
Clarity from U.S. tax reform, a supportive economic backdrop, solid equity market valuations, significant private sponsor interest as well as corporateÃÂÃÂs desire for strategic M&A across sectors are all supporting healthy activity.
Moving to Institutional Client Services; third quarter net revenues were $3.1 billion, down 13% sequentially but roughly flat versus last year.
Currencies increased versus a year ago in both G10 and emerging markets, driven by higher activity and better performance.
Equities client execution net revenues of $681 million were roughly flat sequentially and up 17% versus a year ago.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.1 billion, reflecting net gains from private investments, primarily driven by improved corporate performance.
Our net interest income continues to grow as we increase more recurring revenue streams and lend more to our broad client base.
Net revenues were down 8% sequentially, driven by significantly lower incentive fees but up 12% versus a year ago on higher management and other fees and incentive fees.

I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, expenses, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, supplementary leverage ratio and stress capital buffer.
This is why David, John and I, along with the rest of the leadership team, will look for new ways to grow our businesses while improving our operating efficiency for the long term.
IÃÂÃÂll now walk you through our third quarter and year-to-date results, then cover each of our businesses.
We grew year-to-date revenues by 16% or $3.8 billion, and we delivered positive operating leverage, growing pre-tax earnings by 22%.
Our year-to-date revenue growth demonstrates solid progress across the firm as all four of our business segments grew at a double-digit pace.
That reflects an 18% rebound in FICC and a 15% increase in Equities where we continue to work to deepen our existing relationships and expand our client franchise.
Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2 billion, down 3% versus the second quarter, but up 10% versus a year ago, driven by a rebound in equity underwriting.
However, our year-to-date performance was a record, reflecting strong client engagement and our multiyear investment in our acquisition finance business.
FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.3 billion, down 22% sequentially and 10% lower than a year ago, driven primarily by low levels of volatility and client activity.
Turning to Equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, down 5% sequentially but up 8% versus a year ago on better performance, higher U.S. equity market volumes and higher average volatility.
Securities services net revenues of $439 million were flat sequentially and rose 9% versus last year, reflecting higher average client balances as we continue to invest to expand our footprint in the business.
On a year-to-date basis, our equities I&L businesses generated $3.5 billion of net revenues, roughly 60% from corporate investments and 40% from real estate.
We continue to reinvest to drive future long-term performance, with 46% of the investments in the portfolio made in the last four years.
Next, turning to Investment Management, we posted net revenues of $1.7 billion in the third quarter, driven by continued growth in our asset management and private wealth businesses.
We emphasize paying for performance to attract and retain the best talent and investment spending to support our clients while building technology, infrastructure and platforms to grow the firm for the future.
Roughly 55% of the increase versus last year continued to be from expenses related to client activity and investments for growth, including approximately $425 million across markets, our consolidated investments and technology; and approximately $190 million from higher brokerage, clearing and exchange fees.
Overall, 40 basis points of the improvement was driven by an increase in common shareholdersÃÂÃÂ equity and reduced market RWAs. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 6%, up 20 basis points versus the second quarter.
Our solid double-digit year-to-date revenue increase demonstrates the capabilities in each of our client businesses, and we continue to work hard to grow further from here.
First, in terms of the pace of activity in Marcus, we have been underwriting and reunderwriting this business from the first quarter ÃÂÃÂ we began in the fourth quarter of 2016 ÃÂÃÂ and at each moment, taking stock of where we are, mindful of being potentially late in the consumer cycle.
One other thought, we had mentioned this in the past that itÃÂÃÂs important, as we expand the firm and grow our businesses and we emphasize lending and also platforms, increasingly, our focus is turning away from comp-to-net revenue ratio, where ÃÂÃÂ which has historically been a topic on these calls, and really to efficiency ratio overall where weÃÂÃÂre looking at comp and non-comp expenses holistically with the focus on profitability.
Just wanted to get your take on what you guys are seeing, some of the ÃÂÃÂ maybe the market share opportunities that you have set out over a year ago, how thatÃÂÃÂs playing out and how much of that is either from like a competitive standpoint versus maybe some of the technology initiatives that you guys have been investing in that maybe you guys have more of a competitive advantage than some others.
And weÃÂÃÂre leading in those extremely competitive businesses with content, scale and making it all client-centric and investing to modernize it with digital access, digital formats of many kinds, digital user experiences, over the Web, same tools that our people use, deploying them to clients, also giving clients the abilities to plug indirectly into our platform through APIs, which is very much a theme for us as well as all companies that are building and deploying technology for their clients.
And weÃÂÃÂve seen, since 2016, about 180 basis points market share growth in low touch and half of that in the year-to-date.
Just given what you guys have done to build out the Investing & Lending business and the makeup today, just how much will the public market volatility, maybe wider credit spreads impact it versus sort of the core lending growth?
I guess if you could share just an update on the growth initiatives you guys outlined to expand the customer footprint and kind of where you are in the ability to pick up an extra billion dollars of revenues over the next couple of years.
And there, again, itÃÂÃÂs taking the tools that weÃÂÃÂve developed for ourselves and sharing them very broadly with clients in a variety of formats, including for many clients who want to just plug in through APIs and get our data sets and risk analytics directly and plug into their computers, doing this all while optimizing our resources, managing our liquidity capital and expenses.
So you see capital increase by virtue of retained earnings, and you look at the speed with which we turned velocity on the commitments made so that commitments are not sitting on the book for an extended time, all of these are inputs and variables that I think say a lot about the businessÃÂÃÂ ability to adapt.
So in that context, acquisitions around our Consumer business have been made, and I think weÃÂÃÂll continue to make them.
I think equally in the context of the Investment Management Division, historically, you have seen us make small acquisitions in that context because you can pick up teams or assets or sort of extend yourself into adjacent businesses.
Unsecured lending in the Marcus platform being one, but equally, the value of deposits in that franchise being another, and then there may well be other opportunities that present themselves in terms of new business between now and then.
I guess the point IÃÂÃÂm making is that when you look at the loan component that makes up a number of different inputs to that target, our ambition is not to stretch through the target, meaning weÃÂÃÂre not going to let that business sort of grow because the target is out there in terms of balance sheet.
And finally, IÃÂÃÂd say ÃÂÃÂ and an example of this would be the nascent plans now around corporate cash management, which is I view us as having an extraordinary set of relationships with corporates to sort of look and build that business on a technology platform that will be rather edgy.
So just imagine, when you look at the strength of the Investment Banking business and you find us in number one positions across a range of different products, imagine us extending that product set now to corporate cash management and other similar such businesses, and I think the opportunity there is fairly extensive growth in areas that weÃÂÃÂve not played in before.
So as I said, I think, in response to a question earlier, our reserve build has been commensurate with loan growth, and itÃÂÃÂs not a function of any perceived deterioration in the book itself.
But equally and to your question, capitalÃÂÃÂs a scarce resource, and we need to ensure that capital is being allocated appropriately to businesses that can hurdle what we care to hold out for them in the context of ways in which we can serve customers and clients.
And so what I find positive in that and a guide toward where we will be is that weÃÂÃÂre going to look to continue to fund our growth from within the business and all the while produce operating leverage in the business.
Longer term, I think we should hold ourselves out to even greater efficiencies because platforms will become more mature, delivery of product across all of our businesses will be more efficiently delivered, and youÃÂÃÂll start to see pickup at the top line by virtue of the investment in the growth initiatives themselves.
I think that weÃÂÃÂre particularly well positioned to do that in the context of the adjacency that exists between our Investment Management Division and Marcus, where we have an extraordinary factory floor in GSAM that can build and develop product.
And so I offer this out not just to give you an indication of what the platform might look like, what the forward road map might be with respect to product, but equally to sort of let you in on the adjacencies and channels and opportunities that exist around Goldman Sachs that can serve in the growth of what we try to build with respect to consumers.
Now over the last several years, if you look at the cash and derivatives contribution to equities client execution, itÃÂÃÂs evenly balanced, though it can, of course, change from quarter-to-quarter.
IÃÂÃÂd answer your question without limit to any particular division, meaning if I look at Investment Banking, as part of the growth initiatives with the 2020 target, we set out to open offices in a number of different cities, where we had not formally been and to look to expand the client base, because thereÃÂÃÂs very attractive, accretive business to be had in and among those clients.

goldmansachs,q4,2018,"We remain committed to delivering a full range of services to our clients, including advice, market liquidity, investment management and financing.
As many of you know, John, Stephen and I are conducting a comprehensive front-to-back review across each of our businesses, including 3-year forward plans to identify opportunities to strengthen or expand our client footprint and to operate more efficiently.
Starting with our market-making business in FICC and Equities, we've spent a significant amount of time, evaluating all aspects of our businesses, including our delivery model, with a focus on providing best-in-class client experience and execution.
We are also actively engaged in pursuing opportunities to grow our addressable market by broadening client relationships and improving our mix of products, services, particularly the corporates.
As we evaluated opportunities to improve services to our clients and expand our franchise, cash management presents an illogical area for us given the breadth of our corporate relationships and the size of that wallet.
Across these and other investments for growth, combined with a significant focus on operating efficiency, we are beginning to deliver on our commitment to enhance the durability of our revenues and our earnings.
Importantly, we are making significant investments to further expand our client franchise, grow revenues and enhance the long-term earnings profile of the firm, the cost of which is being funded by the embedded operating leverage in our businesses.
The team I have assembled to execute on our priorities, including John and Stephen, have an increased sense of urgency and discipline to help move our business forward.
The firm reported fourth quarter net revenues of $8.1 billion, resulting in $36.6 billion for the full year.
In the fourth quarter, the business produced net revenues of $2 billion, up 3% versus the third quarter as a significant pickup in M&A completions helped offset a decline in underwriting revenues as the difficult market backdrop slowed issuance volumes globally.
For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7.9 billion, up 7% from 2017 on increases in both Financial Advisory and Underwriting.
The strong performance reflects our continued focus on building long-term client relationships and our ongoing investment in talent and capabilities.
For the full year, ICS generated $13.5 billion of net revenues, up 13% compared to 2017, driven by healthier volumes, better wallet share and improved execution in certain of our businesses, notably in commodities.
FICC client execution net revenues were $822 million in the fourth quarter, down 18% versus 2017 amid challenging market conditions, particularly in credit and, to a lesser extent, in rates.
Commissions and fees were 9% higher, attributable to increased client activity, following the significant uptick in volatility, particularly in low touch where we continue to gain market share.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting continued strong results in private equity investments.
For the full year, equity Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $4.5 billion.
We continue to reinvest to drive future long-term performance, with 47% of the investments in the portfolio made in the last 4 years.
The business remains well positioned for growth as we continue to invest in people and make bolt-on acquisitions to enhance our product offering to better serve our clients.
For the full year, other operating expenses rose 20%, and roughly half of the increase related to client activity and investments for growth.
But I think the important element to convey on that side is that there's a long history in the investing side, particularly in equity, in both sourcing interesting and sometimes unique opportunities for businesses that demonstrate stability and growth trajectory.
And when you look at that opportunity and you compare what would be significant growth for us compared to other people that are in that business given our platform, our investing resources and our capability to manage money for institutional and individual clients, we have meaningful growth without setting overly ambitious targets.
I would ask you to sort of rely more on the progression and the stability and sustainability of this business just in terms of what it has produced for many, many quarters over several years in the context of the investing.
Part of what I wanted to point out in answering the prior question is that there's a good deal here of realized gain in the book and a continual velocity turn in the portfolio, and sales or partial sales sort of are one part of that.
But just when you think about some of the investments that you guys have been making in some of the new growth initiatives on the technology side, how should we be thinking about the run rate going into '19 and '20 in an environment where obviously the market has been a bit more volatile more recently?
All of the investment spend in the different projects that David and I have been talking about, whether that's in Marcus or whether that's corporate cash management or whether that's the building incremental platforms inside the securities and trading business, is in that $892 million.
My view is that the rate of growth in that expense, while it will grow, the rate of growth will be less than the rate of growth that we saw in '18, and we're going to continue to look to deploy existing operating leverage in the business as a source of that investment spend in the business overall.
Obviously, we're cognizant of the way the market is looking at our business mix, and we're also cognizant of the performance of the stock.
If 3 to 5 years ago, we said on one of these calls that in 2018, we would have a year where our FICC ICS revenues were less than $6 billion, we were making significant investments in building out a digital consumer platform and we happened to be in a situation where we had [indiscernible] litigation expense that we would deliver $36.6 billion of revenues and a 13.3% return, people would have said, not possible.
And the reason that that's happened is we have been working for a number of years to broaden our business, expand our addressable wallet and, at the same point in time, increase the durability of our revenues.
And as we're developing a plan to move forward, we see things we can do in the existing businesses and adjacent build, some of which we mentioned, where we feel very confidently that we can continue to push returns higher, especially if we also continue to be focused on running the firm more efficiently, which as Stephen stated, we're very committed to doing.
The one thing that I said in my comments that I just want to reiterate is we accept the size of the wallet share that exists, and it's our job to run the business well based on that wallet share to allocate capital over time efficiently and to run that business in an effective way from a cost perspective, and we continue to do that while continuing to invest in the client franchise.
And you are absolutely right to point out that our increased market share, and David was referring to it, among institutional clients has not, in the last couple of years, demonstrated revenue conversion.
And it's against that addressable market that we're going to take and are taking in part of -- as part of the front to back of U.S. to the proper expense size against that wallet and against that TAM, the amount of debt and liquidity we need to put against that business, the amount of risk that we need to take on in the context of intermediating risk for clients and then, ultimately, the amount of capital to put against it.
I mean, I think the quantification that I can give you is really sort of part of what I was responding to in terms of Christian's question, which is in the last five years, as I said, we've taken expense down 30%, RWAs by 40% and reallocation of capital.
And I'm not hesitating other than part of the front-to-back review that we are engaged in right now is to answer the very question you're asking, which is, again, understand the addressable market, including an expanded set of customers and clients that we will focus on and then being quite clear about what our taking that market can be and then the inputs to driving that business, whether it's expenses, liquidity, capital and otherwise.
But there does continue to be some questions, I think, among investors and analysts about the need for a bigger deal to help balance out the business.
I think you'll continue to see a few smaller add-on opportunities across our businesses, particularly when you look at asset management and wealth management.
But it's our job as a management team to be well-versed on any opportunity that we think can advance our returns and our cost for shareholders, and we'll operate that way as we move forward.
So in the context of corporate cash management, you'll remember that our interest in this was in part a view that when we look at sort of the most significant relationships that we had in Investment Banking across those corporates that they were paying a considerable amount to the market, almost equal to that, that they pay in the market in which we participate, namely our Advisory and Underwriting business, but they were paying in and around Treasury services and corporate cash management.
I'd also point out, just as an aside, that the first customer of this platform, in fact, will be Goldman Sachs such that we can reduce the cost of our own operational deposits outside of the bank, and I think in the process, de-risk the firm from that perspective.
So I think if you look historically from the time that we acquired the GE deposit platform in the U.S., I would say that the beta was lower than where it's going, meaning it'll remain lower than one, but in the rate environment in which we were in, it was very little by way of movement and rate.
I mean, our view on efficiency ratio and the migration there is that we need to look across all expenses, particularly as we're building out sort of more platform-driven businesses, which will be less compensation, if you will, expense intensive and more operationally intensive.
Just one follow-up as it relates to some of your comments on the marginal margin improving, and I know it was a little more than a year ago when you initially laid out those growth targets on the revenue side of $5 billion.
As shown on Page 2, it is important to underscore that our overarching priority is to execute our core mission: Serving our diverse client franchise, which includes corporations and governments, institutions and individuals; executing on our client-centric model will drive long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders.
Over recent years, we've made significant progress on improving capital utilization and reallocating capital away from FICC commensurate with its potential in order to grow strategically, important and higher returning businesses.
Based on our track record, there is an opportunity to raise additional third-party funds across equity, credit and real estate, thereby augmenting fee income.
A concern that central banks would continue to tighten into a slowing growth environment cause weakness in equity and credit markets and resulted in an increase in volatility of many macro assets.
While this has created challenges for many of our institutional investing clients, it is also driving potential future opportunities for active managers to add value.
In addition for now the absolute level of activity in the real economy remains fairly robust, and this is reflected in broad CEO sentiment and our Investment Banking transaction backlog.
The first 3 quarters demonstrated continued strength in global equity and credit markets despite geopolitical uncertainty.
The fourth quarter witnessed higher levels of market volatility, increased client engagement and negative performance across virtually all asset classes.
Market volatility, declining equity prices and wider credit spreads weighed on issuer sentiment as net revenues were down 21% sequentially in the fourth quarter to $843 million.
Our Investment Banking franchise overall remains very well positioned and continues to grow.
We are ending 2018 with an Investment Banking backlog meaningfully higher than where we finished 2017, notwithstanding a decline versus last quarter.
The remaining decrease reflected lower results in rates while the other FICC businesses were relatively consistent with last year's performance.
Second, we remained focused on leveraging our best-in-class Investment Banking relationships to better serve corporate clients.
Equities client execution net revenues were up significantly versus a challenged fourth quarter of 2017, with better performance in cash.
Our share of global equity market volumes increased by over 100 basis points versus 2017 and included growth across all regions, reflecting a multiyear positive trend.
For the full year, assets under supervision increased $48 billion resulting from $37 billion of long-term net inflows primarily in fixed income and equity assets and $52 billion of net inflows into liquidity products.
The improvement in the advanced ratio reflected 80 basis points related to lower credit risk weighted assets due to inclusion of the firm's default experience into the determination of probability of default calculation.
Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Is there some reason you think the market will finally start to give the stock credit for revenue growth at ROE?
Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
First of all, before I ask my question, I just want to say I think it really does serve shareholders very well that you're doing this new, more fulsome strategic review and outlook.
Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
And then maybe a question for David on the capital theme still.
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with the Wells Fargo Securities.
Over time, we have grown our corporate lending book for reasons obviously unrelated to corporate cash management because it wasn't in the plan years ago but as part of what we've been doing strategically and growing and developing in terms of a broader set of products and relationships with corporates.
And then for my second question, while we've seen spreads net back and the loan market recover here, CLOs and levered loans became a big topic in the fourth quarter.
Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
But what impact do you think the MiFID changes has had on your equity business?
",37.47,0.6785769
goldmansachs,q1,2019,"We reported first quarter 2019 revenues of $8.8 billion, down 13% versus last year, reflecting a slower start to the year relative to the robust market backdrop of a year ago.
To drive long-term shareholder value, our strategy sets up three primary objectives; first, we aim to strengthen our existing businesses; second, we aim to diversify our business mix with new services to expand our opportunity set and increase the durability of our revenues; and third, we aim to operate more efficiently and effectively across all aspects, including expenses, financing and capital.
To achieve these objectives, we will endeavor to deliver one-Goldman Sachs to our clients; we will focus on growth where there is an adjacency to our existing businesses; we will expand our addressable market to deliver more products to existing and new clients; and we will pursue this expansion, via investments in talent, technology and platforms, all the while our emphasis will be on transparency with our stakeholders.
Ultimately, we believe the strategy will allow us to serve more clients with differentiated products and services, increase the durability and predictability of our earnings profile, deliver improved profitability, optimize our capital and deliver higher long-term returns to shareholders.
Last fall, as you know, we began a process of re-underwriting each of our businesses, including the development of three year plans for the firm.
Instead, this is an effort to invest in talent, technology, platforms and straight through processing to drive new sources of revenue, improve efficiency and drive higher margins.
Lastly, these efforts will help us to better serve corporate clients across the firm, including in adjacent areas like ICS and investment management.
However, our reviews have identified opportunities to cut expenses and capital from certain underperforming parts of the commodities business and increase investments in others.
Pivoting to investment management, we continue to grow assets under supervision in key strategic areas, including advisory, outsource CIO and ETFs, as well as in our world-class ultrahigh network business where we have modest share in a very fragmented market.
Overtime, as I mentioned earlier, we will seek to reduce the capital intensity of this business by managing more client assets in fund form and reducing our balance sheet investments.
We're also making a number of changes to reduce cost and drive long-term operating leverage by increasing use of shared platforms across our business, and migrating more of our efforts to locations like Bengaluru, Warsaw, Dallas and Salt Lake City.
Before moving to discuss the quarter, let me turn to Page 9, where we layout a roadmap for what to expect in the coming quarters in terms of performance targets, financial disclosure and a broader discussing of the strategic way forward for Goldman Sachs.
On Page 16, turning to investment management, we produced $1.6 billion of revenues in the first quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading PWM franchise.
For the quarter, our efficiency ratio was approximately 67%, up 100 basis point versus year ago largely driven by lower revenues.
Combined with our investment in platforms and scale this positions us to create significant value for the clients we serve and solid long-term return to our shareholders.
And as I said on the last call and we will continue to say forward our view is that we will encourage people to look at overall expenses both comp and non-comp, particularly as we roll out and build platforms that will yield higher marginal margin and that ultimately are less consumptive of comp intensive expense so much as OpEx intensive expense.
First question just on activity levels, I think one of the challenges is during the quarter, obviously, week first half and then that's improved but I think some of the things that you guys mentioned in terms of M&A, the pipeline weaker just given what completed but ECM better.
So just wanted to get a sense on what areas of the business you think can reverse relatively quickly versus what areas you may take a bit longer for that confidence to come back to where we were, say in September of last year?
In terms of market activity and client engagement, we saw significant pickup in the second half of the quarter.
Michael, the only thing I would add to David's comment is that I think in equities, we're seeing and saw over the quarter month-by-month increases in prime balances, which speaks to an increasing level of activity.
And I think if you look at the equity I&L line, though it doesn't necessarily skew to where the public equity markets fit, I think there is obviously the opportunity to take advantage of a positive environment just in terms of event driven valuation and the like as we play forward.
First, I think when you look at the efficiency ratio obviously it was up on the quarter, which was more reflection of revenues being down than it is expenses, because expenses obviously came down.
I think when you look at investments that are being made over the course of '19 and '20, we have a view as we're now developing three year models as to when we'll see or begin to see efficiency play through.
As a general matter, we are looking to make changes in the way in which we're engaging in FIC, all with an eye toward generating considering more revenue for the division and at the same time, optimizing to the deployment of capital and reducing down expense.
I would also say that if you look across all of the businesses within FIC, each of them has their own orientation and the work we're doing both to generate capital, consume less capital and equally be more efficient in terms of expense.
So for example, the Europe business has been in the bank, it benefits from lower cost funding that sits in the bank and we're looking at ways in which we can be more efficient in the deployment of capital.
I think what we've seen based on other efforts in this space is that this likely will be some mixed approach in the context of both technology and human engagement.
The way in which we look at overall trade flow from the beginning through to the middle and in the context of collateral management through to settlement, the place of operations in that chain now matters more than it's ever mattered in the past in the context of our engagement and the question of customer satisfaction and client satisfaction with the business.
I think that you have to expect if you just look at the size and the scale of their more traditional banking operations and their consumer banking operation, it's going be more elevated than their businesses.
And if you look at the growth rate of it, it's going to continue to push higher and it's much more sustainable in some of gains that you get in and out any the quarter in the other part of the business.
But we aim to be more disclosive going forward in terms of the overall context of disclosure around our investment spend in these various technologies.
As I mentioned earlier, client adjacent lending that serves a number of different businesses around the firm.
These elements are critical to our key growth platforms, including Marcus and mass affluent wealth where we will pursue partnerships to access large numbers of consumers; Marquee, our digital institutional platform where the ability to innovate can help us engage at scale with our institutional client base; and corporate cash management, where we can serve existing clients to the firm and offer differentiated products on a digital platform.
For our franchise, there is significant value in serving these clients, including lower deposit funding costs and additional foreign exchange revenues.
In credit where synergies with Investment Banking facilitate our high rankings in both trading and underwriting, we are building models and tools to facilitate faster inventory turnover and reduce drawdown risk as we execute client flows.
Finally, through our one-Goldman Sachs initiative, we aim to shift focus away from per trade returns, taking a more holistic approach to client relationships.
As I mentioned, alternatives is a key focus where client demand remains very strong with over $1.5 trillion of capital raised industry wide in the past five years.
Based on last year's results for every 100 basis points in efficiency ratio reduction we achieve, it equates to approximately $300 million of net income and a 40 basis point increase in ROE all else equal.
Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.8 billion down 11% versus the solid fourth quarter and flat versus a year ago as very strong advisory performance offset a sharp decline in underwriting.
Financial advisory revenues were $887 million, up 51% versus last year, driven by our leading market share.
Equity underwriting net revenues of $271 million declined sharply versus last year, driven by a lack of IPO activity.
Our Investment Banking backlog decreased versus the fourth quarter as revenues were realized.
FIC client execution net revenues were $1.8 billion in the first quarter, more than doubling fourth quarter levels, reflecting a better operating environment.
Results were impacted by significantly lower performance in derivatives, given lower market volatility versus the first quarter of 2018 when volatility was elevated and client activity was robust.
Commissions and fees net revenues were $714 million, driven by lower client volumes versus both last quarter and versus a year ago.
Securities services net revenues of $370 million fell by 14% year-over-year amid lower average client balances as hedge funds deleveraged, though balances have been recovering.
Equity securities generated net revenues of $847 million, reflecting net gains from private and public equities, company specific events and corporate performance.
As I have commented on the last earnings call, this seeming inconsistency is because our portfolio skews more to private securities than public holdings as shown on the slide, and there were less event driven valuation remarks of our private equity holdings.
Our global equity portfolio was $22 billion at quarter end and remains well diversified with roughly 1,000 different investments.
Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.6 trillion, up $57 billion versus the fourth quarter, driven by $20 billion of long-term net inflows in fixed income strategies and $59 billion of market appreciation, that being partially offset by $22 billion of liquidity product outflows.
Our total operating expenses decreased by 11% versus the first quarter of last year, reflecting lower compensation and benefits expense and lower activity related brokerage clearing exchange fees.
The ratios improved by 40 and 30 basis points respectively versus year end, driven by higher retained earnings.
[Operator instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
So you outlined efforts to increase fee-based recurring revenues and reduced the volatility in that principle investment line.
One of the interesting comments that was made is that you noted this would be ROE accretive overtime, which is something that many investors have questioned just given the significant gains generated within equity I&L.
I think that it's important to understand this transition as just that, which is a transition away from the balance sheet intensive investing to one which is predicated largely on managing third-party money and generating fee revenue, which itself will dampen P&L volatility and be less consumptive of balance sheet is going to take time.
So in the deck and in your remarks, you noted that $10 billion plus deposit growth target for year with that 100 basis point spread benefit by replacing higher cost wholesale funds with lower cost deposits.
Our next question is from the line of Michael Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
Make no mistake that bring together Marcus with our investment management division had a strategic component to it, which was we were a business that for many, many years obviously managed funds and managed asset for high net worth individuals.
So first question here just on the mass affluent opportunity within Marcus, Ayco and other firm had corporate relationships, seem to provide a very strong customer acquisition channel.
",36.76,0.76974535
goldmansachs,q2,2019,"Switching gears, I'd like to provide some insights on two important strategic decisions we made in the second quarter and our alternatives in wealth management businesses.
Upon closing the transaction today, United Capital will become a powerful complement to our Ayco business, our leading financial executive counseling and investment advisory business, which serves many of the largest corporations in the United States.
Moving on to Page 4, Investment Banking produce net revenues of $1.9 billion, 3% versus the first quarter and down 9% versus a robust year ago quarter.
Moving to Institutional Client Services on Page 5, net revenues were solid at $3.5 billion in the second quarter down 3% versus last year, as our diversified business experienced low client activity in FICC, offset by strength in equities.
The environment notwithstanding and as I have said previously, we are investing heavily to automate our workflows, serve our clients electronically, monitor our cost base and deliver structured solutions in capital efficient formats.
Net revenues for the second quarter were $2 billion, up 14% sequentially and up 6% versus a year ago.
On Page 9 turning to Investment Management, we produced $1.6 billion of revenues in the second quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading Private Wealth franchise.
Incentive fees in the second quarter of last year were driven by the timing of realizations and performance across a variety of our alternative investment funds.
Also as we have noted in the past, as we grow more scale and platform driven businesses, it is our expectation that compensation will decline as a proportion of total operating expenses and the efficiency ratio will become a more relevant measure for the firm.
While we continue to assess capital return in the context of the market environment and opportunities for accretive investment in our business consistent with our long-held strategy, we are encouraged by the increased flexibility afforded by our strong capital position.
That said we continue to value the flexibility of share repurchases as they allow us to be more dynamic with capital allocations based on the environment and business opportunities.
We have spent a lot of time thinking about it because when you look at these businesses which in the past had been organized over multiple parts of the firm.
We have said publicly that when you look at the businesses that we operate here collectively, they make us one of the top five alternative asset managers in the world today.
So I think it's fair to say as a general matter this year CCAR clearly demonstrates the direction of travel that we want to go in terms of overall capital return.
And I think what played out in the context of CCAR is a reflection of what we are comfortable with in terms of what we're going to look to put out given where the market and circumstances are.
On the question you raised about FICC, the focus for FICC not borne of this quarter in particular, but since we came on and started to look and re-underwrite the business has been around capital efficiency and equally cost in the context of delivering into our clients.
When you look at FICC in particular, I would say that the business is focused on clients in the context of expanding out the corporates, transaction banking and the like.
We're going to continue to look at ways of accomplishing that and greater capital and cost efficiency.
Just given some of the investments and in the longer term to focus on the efficiency ratio, just wanted to get an update or run through some of the initiatives that are in place, and the progress you guys are making to lower the cost base and over time and improve the efficiency ratio.
These two are lowering the throughput of trades, it's lowering the ability or I should say the price point to engage with clients where they want to meet us, which is it's less human capital, it's more platform driven; it carries higher efficiency to it and that's the direction of travel.
On the expense base, I think in the near term there is sort of quick to be realized certain cost efficiencies in our trading costs, meaning what's happening on platforms that are introduced that underpin incumbent businesses that are not looking for, if you will, new flows to command, but we're transacting with clients in a different manner and form than what we've done in the past, just one really small example.
Now we're able to provide a platform where the client can engage and look to conform and develop a portfolio on a much more efficient basis cost sufficient basis than what has happened in the past.
But this is a risk business and we'll continue to look at it as we grow it out on a risk-adjusted return basis.
So if you have a 60/40 mix and market intermediation is softer, which it clearly was given the environment we had this quarter, your NIM portion or your non market intermediation portion has less volatility, but we continue to make investments as you highlight in some of these products and particularly in broadening out the client base, I'd ask Stephen to provide just a little bit more detail on how we think some of that's point through.
So the way we've been looking at it as we've been scrutinizing and re underwriting that business is we're focused on both the numerator and the denominator of the ROE calculation, meaning it's important that nobody lose focus that we need to mind how much revenue is coming in, i.e. how do we want to define the tangible market that we face.
First question just on the United Capital with the deal closing, just look to maybe get a little more perspective on how you're thinking about the business opportunity.
And we are in the process of that and as those plans come forward we will be more communicative and transparent as to what expectation we think you can have with that business over time.
And I think this business continues that secular growth and so as the environment evolves, I think there will be periods of time where we will see increased activity versus what we've seen in the first half of the year.
David will start with a high level review of our financial performance, the current operating environment, give an update on several recent strategy decisions and discuss our stress test results.
We reported second quarter 2019 revenues of $9.5 billion, down slightly versus last year, but nonetheless reflecting solid franchise performance amid a mixed operating environment.
Our equity market making business delivered its second highest quarter in four years, and our franchise continues to generate broad based market share gains across regions.
We produced the quarterly I&L revenues in eight years, aided by significant gains from our private equity investment - investing activities reflecting our ability to source opportunities for the firm and our clients, and record net interest income in debt I&L which annualizes the $3.5 billion.
Turning to Page 2, our second quarter results were generated on an operating backdrop that presented both opportunities and challenges.
In response, equity volatility then increased; global markets turned risk off, the US yield curve inverted, and client activity slowed across a variety of products as our corporate and investment clients stayed on the sidelines.
On a combined basis, Ayco and United Capital will serve clients with over $80 billion of assets under supervision, representing a strong base from which to grow our mass affluent wealth franchise.
This change reflects the board and management view that dividend growth is a critical component to delivering strong shareholder returns, and reflects our progress over recent years increasing more durable fee-based revenues to support the higher dividend.
Moving to underwriting, equity underwriting net revenues of $482 million improves significantly versus the first quarter which experienced the government shutdown and held roughly flat versus a strong quarter last year.
Year-to-date, we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting supported by $16 billion of deal volume across over 100 transactions this quarter.
The second quarter last year included a number of significant contributions from investment grade and leveraged finance activity, which did not repeat to the same extent this quarter.
Our deal flows in this quarter were consistent with trends across the industry, which reflected materially lower volumes in the loan market and lower activity in acquisition related financings, particularly with financial sponsors.
And while markets can change quickly, we are optimistic that our clients will remain active in executing strategic transactions in the coming quarters given healthy levels of client dialogue and continued need to access financing markets.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the second quarter, down 13% year-over-year reflecting both the mix operating environment and generally lower client activity despite notable strength in Europe.
We saw lower structured finance client activity versus a year ago, while closing credit came alongside a more muted origination backdrop particularly in investment grade debt and leveraged loans as I had mentioned earlier.
We believe our success reflects our continuing consolidation of global market share and a dedication to serving clients across a full suite of cash, derivatives and prime services in both hi touch and low touch channels.
Equities client execution net revenues of $772 million increased 13% relative to the first quarter and were up 12% versus a year ago.
Equity securities generated robust net revenues of $1.5 billion, driven by company specific events like IPOs and the performance of corporates in the portfolio contributing revaluations.
Second quarter results were up 20% versus a year ago, primarily reflecting higher net gains from public equities.
Turning to Page 8, net revenues from Debt Securities and Loans were $989 million, included $872 million of net interest income and modest mark-to-market gains.
Net revenues included management and other fees of $1.4 billion which were up 5% versus the first quarter and up 4% versus last year, reflecting continued growth in assets under supervision.
Our total operating expenses of $6.1 billion were flat versus the second quarter of last year, reflecting lower litigation and lower compensation and benefits expense, offset by increased expense for technology and consolidated investments.
Our year-to-date efficiency ratio was 65.6%, up 100 basis points versus a year ago, driven by lower revenues and ongoing investments, partially offset by lower compensation expense.
Year-to-date, the total pretax cost from Markus, Apple Card and our new transaction banking platform is approximately $275 million resulting in a drag of roughly 60 basis points on our ROE.
The ratio is each increased by 10 basis points versus the first quarter driven by higher retained earnings.
Our global core liquid assets averaged $225 billion during the quarter, which we continue to note may decline as we have opportunities to support client demand.
While our second quarter performance was solid despite the mixed operating environment, we believe as David said, the overall economic growth backdrop should remain supportive of our business.
In I&L, I'm curious I know you're going through the process of consolidating the businesses and I'm sure there's some challenges there, but my question is on you've always been good at this but I feel like managing conflicts between advisor, balance sheet investment, and third party funds will just even be that much harder as you bring this all together and grow third party.
As David pointed out and it's also worth noting that different sleeves whether it's credit, real estate with respect to for example equity carry different capital density and the opportunity to realize higher returns on the balance sheet deployed will be there.
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
How much of the strong NII growth that you guys have seen over the past few years has been balanced versus rate?
Your next question comes from a line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.

goldmansachs,q3,2019,"David will start with a high-level review of our financial performance and the operating environment, heÃÂÃÂll then provide a brief update on several strategy items including key investments we are making to drive future growth, the significance of the Applecart launch, specifically, as it relates to other technology innovation at the firm and recent personnel changes to align with our longer-term strategic priorities.
In investment banking despite lower results versus a strong third quarter in 2018, we continue to have the worldÃÂÃÂs leading franchise, ranking Number 1 in global announced and completed M&A and Number 1 in equity underwriting year-to-date.
These investments reflect our deliberate and disciplined approach in building new scalable businesses to serve a broader set of clients, including our markets consumer business, the recently launched Apple Card and a new transaction banking platform.
Starting on Page 4, Investment Banking produced net revenues of 1.7 billion, down 9% versus the second quarter and down 15% versus a strong year-ago quarter.
While the recent market reception for certain companies has been less favorable, over the long term, we believe investors will continue to invest in growing, innovative, and disruptive businesses that create value for customers and shareholders.
Given our healthy levels of strategic dialogues, our expanding client footprint, and the nature of our corporate relationships, we continue to be optimistic that our clients will remain active in executing transactions supported by well-functioning and liquid capital markets.
Moving to Institutional Client Services on Page 5, net revenues were solid at $3.3 billion in the third quarter, up 6% versus last year, driven by growth across our diversified FICC and equities businesses, and as David noted at the start, reflective of progress made across our businesses in terms of our clients and business mix and the development of electronic platforms.
Our equity investments generated net revenues of $662 million, down significantly versus last year, driven in part by a reduction in market value on our public investment portfolio.
On Page 9, turning to investment management, we produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the third quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading private wealth franchise.
Also, as we have noted previously, as we grow more platform-driven businesses, we expect compensation to decline as a portion of total operating expenses making our total efficiency ratio a more relevant metric for the firm.
As David discussed earlier, we continue to invest in a number of important initiatives across the firm both to build new businesses and digital platforms, as well as to enhance the firm's infrastructure.
To provide you some measure of that investment, a meaningful driver of the year-to-date growth in non-compensation expenses relates to firm-wide technology spending and expenses related to four key projects, Marcus, Apple Card, Transaction Banking, and United Capital.
Year-to-date, the total pre-tax impact of our organic projects, Marcus, Apple Card and Transaction Banking is approximately $450 million, resulting in a drag of roughly 60 basis points on our ROE.
We actually saw some opportunity to work with clients in the context of that and deploy balance sheet, and I think you framed it correctly, there's still work to do to move forward with respect to the short-term funding markets.
Thanks for the question, Christian and I ÃÂÃÂ you know I think, I understand, IÃÂÃÂd try to put it in, you know what, through the cycle context and also short-term context.
But as Stephen clearly articulated on the call, there has been about a 60-basis point drain on our ROE year-to-date given the investments that weÃÂÃÂre making across our three principal projects, the card, our markets digital consumer banking platform and also transaction services.
IÃÂÃÂd also point out that as the portfolio around Apple Card grows in throughout 2020, obviously weÃÂÃÂre building that reserve from, you know, a base of zero as it relates to the credit card portfolio itself.
Just wanted to get, you know, your perspective on like how youÃÂÃÂre thinking about that business going forward in terms of third-party funds?
Sure, Michael and, you know, I think we talked about this a little bit on the last call, but we see the opportunity for us as a significant manager of alternative assets both for ourselves and for our clients at the time ÃÂÃÂ at the current time, an opportunity for us to meaningfully grow the client fees that we have.
As I think we stated publicly before, and we talked last time that we were on the call, we will continue to invest balance sheet capital and people should not see or expect in the short-term a change in with respect to the way we deploy balance sheet, but over time the medium and long-term as we evolve this business and grow other revenue streams, weÃÂÃÂll certainly reconsider that and we evaluate what we think is appropriate.
So, I wanted to just start with a follow up to one of ChristianÃÂÃÂs earlier questions, itÃÂÃÂs one that weÃÂÃÂve been fielding from a number investors as well, which is this concern that you have a long timeline before some of the newer growth initiatives achieve scale, suggesting it could, a lot of time can pass before we actually see the benefits to the P&L.
WeÃÂÃÂre taking the opportunity to grow more fee-based durable recurring revenues, but that will take some time and weÃÂÃÂre thinking about building those businesses in the medium and long term for Goldman Sachs over a long period of time.
You know we think about getting real contributions from some of these investments that weÃÂÃÂre making over the next three to five years, but I understand in the context of short-term catalysts that that might feel like a long time.
Steven, the one other thing I'll add to DavidÃÂÃÂs comments is around funding optimization and liquidity management, which I think will yield much shorter-term benefit to the firm overall and that work, you know, has already begun.
I think all of those in addition to what David was speaking about in terms of efficiency and overall operating expenses will be two near-term elements that I think people can look to, you know, in the context of a longer-term profile to some of the bigger investments.
WeÃÂÃÂre building ÃÂÃÂ to the second part of your question in investment platform for the long run, private investment ÃÂÃÂ private investment, alternative investment activities, whether it's private equity or credit or infrastructure or growth capital, I think despite the fact that there can be dialogue around evolutions in that business or potential regulation of certain aspects of that, that will not change the opportunity in those businesses for us over a long period of time.
Two questions, one you cited the deposit is $55 billion, you know, obviously a very large number that youÃÂÃÂve been able to generate over the course of last couple of years in Marcus and others.
If we continue to do that over time and if over time because the investments that we make add more fee-based or durable revenue to our business mix and weÃÂÃÂre able therefore to move all the turns higher, I do believe over the time the market will reward us.
I think, Mike, maybe to address the question of timeline, so, you know, not all of these initiatives, you know, operate in the same set of time sequence.
You know what we've built to this point in three years, you know, is effectively a bank that has $55 billion of the deposits and $5 billion in loans and a new credit card platform thatÃÂÃÂs begun with Apple, but that can go in a variety of different places and partnerships.
Shorter-term, I would say you could look at, for example, transaction banking, where, you know, that platform is one where, as weÃÂÃÂve said several times, we are the first customer.
So right now, you know, weÃÂÃÂve processed more than $250 billion of payments for Goldman Sachs through that platform and equally we are on schedule to bring very consequential corporate clients to the firm onto that platform and I think given the nature of that spend, its ability to borrow on some of the technology that was built on the consumer side, you know, weÃÂÃÂll have a much faster sort of payback, if you will, relative to the longer cycle around consumer.
And so, when you think about a deal, I know you probably wouldnÃÂÃÂt want to talk about anything specific in a particular space, but how would you balance assessing tangible book regulatory capital hits versus long-term growth and maybe attractiveness of low-cost deposits and other benefits like that?
Well, itÃÂÃÂs difficult to predict kind of the forward trend because obviously, you know, weÃÂÃÂll be mindful of where the markets are and what risk looks like in the context of taking on accretive lending opportunities.
You know in the last year the run rate of net interest income that we are taking in on the book has gone from $2.8 billion on an annualized basis to $3.6 billion looking at the near $900 million that was generated in the quarter.
The approval rates early on have been lower and IÃÂÃÂd say that thatÃÂÃÂs a decision obviously Goldman Sachs is making as the bank, but weÃÂÃÂre doing that in concert with Apple and it is because weÃÂÃÂre quite vigilant from a risk point of view, but not being negatively selected out-of-the-box, meaning over time, weÃÂÃÂll start to see better credits appear, the approval rates will go up, but weÃÂÃÂve seen an enormous inbound.
But from an operational point of view, from a risk perspective, you know, skewing to the higher side of FICO bands, I think weÃÂÃÂre very, very pleased as is Apple with this sort of early month or two or three into this, and, you know, weÃÂÃÂll have more to say as we get further into the development of the portfolio itself.
Over time, I do think as you highlight there can be digital connectivity as we build a more digital two market platform, but thatÃÂÃÂs still something thatÃÂÃÂs often the future, and so we continue to focus on really penetrating a broader set of corporate clients where we have good relationships and access to their employee base.
I mean, I think much of the investing we are doing is consuming operating leverage that exist in the business, and the forward initiatives that David and I have talked about in terms of funding rationalization and expense reduction are all initiatives that need and must go on and they will continue to create operating leverage in the business, which will be put toward growth opportunities in the firm or shareholder return in the absence of them.
I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.
That said, global growth is not without risk as trade issues remain challenging.
While most CEOs remain focused on growing their businesses and capturing opportunities amid the disruptive forces of new technologies, geopolitical issues continue to give rise to some caution.
These include investments in our institutional client platform Marquee where we have seen strong growth to over 50,000 monthly active users and over 1 million API data requests every day.
Looking forward, as David noted, the ingredients for continued M&A activity remains solid.
Year-to-date, we ranked Number 1 globally in equity underwriting supported by nearly $50 billion of deal volume across more than 280 transactions.
Four of our five FICC businesses posted higher net revenues versus the prior year reflecting the continued strength of our client centric model and improved diversification of our business mix.
We also delivered solid performance in credit and mortgages where net revenues increased amidst improved activity from our broadening client base.
These results reflect our continued focus on improving the velocity of risk inventory supporting more efficient capital management in the business.
Lastly in currencies, net revenues declined driven by a more difficult geopolitical backdrop in emerging markets as volatility in Latin America and in particular Argentina offset strong performance in Europe.
For example, this quarter, we executed a number of sizable trades in U.S. investment-grade credit providing key financial and insurance clients access to our broad risk intermediation capabilities.
Equities client execution net revenues of $681 million were flat versus a year ago as stronger cash results offset lower derivative revenues.
Net revenues from commissions and fees were $728 million, up 8% versus a year ago aided by higher client activity.
Private equity net revenues of $929 million were driven by strong underlying corporate performance and events such as sales or additional capital raises.
Against that strength and performance, our private investment portfolio was also burdened by certain negative revaluations, including an approximately $80 million mark associated with our position in the [We] company.
Net revenues included record management and other fees of $1.5 billion, which were up 5% versus last year, reflecting continued growth in assets under supervision.
We also saw significantly lower incentive fees and modestly lower transaction revenues from our PWM client trading activity versus a year ago.
The ratios decreased by 20 basis points and 10 basis points respectively versus the second quarter, driven primarily by increased credit risk-weighted assets and roughly 10 basis point impact from our acquisition of United Capital.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
I know weÃÂÃÂve seen these things come and go before, but I just wanted to see if you could talk specifically towards those two big issues and just see if hopefully just overstating a short-term impact on the market?
Good morning and thanks for taking the questions.
WeÃÂÃÂve historically had an institutional business thatÃÂÃÂs very capital market sensitive.
Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.

goldmansachs,q4,2019,"David will start with brief highlights on our financial results, give an update on the broader operating environment, including developments related to 1MDB, and provide context for our upcoming Investor Day. Stephen will then discuss the recent enhancements we've made to our segment financial presentation, and cover fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results in detail.
On the revenue side, our Global Markets business produced stronger results in an environment that improved over the year, driven by strong leadership and a clear focus on client service.
While our operating expenses grew as a function of litigation and investments in our businesses, we actively controlled our costs across both compensation and non-compensation providing capacity to fund our growth.
We launched the firm's first ever credit card platform in partnership with Apple, and generated over $850 million in net revenues across our broader consumer banking business.
Lending related to our alternative investing businesses, including investments in debt securities and real estate credit is reflected in the Asset Management segment and lending to our individual clients across all wealth plans is in the Consumer & Wealth Management segment.
Additionally, we now report the firm's on balance sheet equity, credit, and real estate investing activities in our Asset Management segment.
To that end, this segment includes management and incentive fees associated with Asset Management clients across the full spectrum of asset classes from cash to alternatives, and will also include the impact of quarterly valuation changes, the balance sheet positions held in public and private equity investments.
Broadly speaking, and as I noted earlier, the new segments align with the client orientation of the firm Investment Banking, Global Markets and Asset Management encompass the firm's engagement with corporate, governments, and institutions, and Consumer &Wealth Management includes our engagement with individuals.
We also continue to see strength in our backlog coming into the New Year, notwithstanding solid revenue bookings from deal closings in the fourth quarter.
Net revenues were $599 million, up 14% versus the third quarter and up 37% from a year-ago, reflecting higher asset-backed and leverage finance activity.
These revenues relate to a net $28 billion funded portfolio of corporate loans now held in investment banking, as well as our portfolio of corporate lending commitments.
Moving to Global Markets on Page 5, net revenues were $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter up 33% versus last year.
Our growth was driven by a better market backdrop in FICC versus the end of last year, and strong performance in our equities businesses.
For the full-year, Global Markets generated $14.8 billion of net revenues, up 2% versus 2018 driven by stronger FICC and higher equity financing performance.
Four out of five of our FICC market making businesses posted higher fourth quarter net revenues versus the prior-year reflecting the continued strength of our client centric model, and improved diversification of our business mix, our environment effectively.
Collectively our Asset Management activities produced net revenues of $3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 52% versus last year, driven by stronger equity investment performance.
For the full-year, Asset Management generated net revenues of $9 billion in line with a strong 2018 as growth in equity investment revenues offset lower incentive fees.
Next our equity investments generated record quarterly net revenues in the fourth quarter of $1.9 billion, up significantly versus last year, driven by gains on our public and private investments.
On Page 8, turning to Consumer & Wealth Management, we produced $1.4 billion of revenues in the fourth quarter, up 8% versus a year-ago.
For the full-year, Consumer & Wealth Management generated net revenues of $5.2 billion, essentially unchanged versus a year-ago, as strong consumer banking growth and higher management and other fees offset lower incentive fees.
For the quarter, Wealth Management net revenues included record management and other fees of $967 million, up 17% versus last year, reflecting organic growth in the United Capital acquisition.
Consumer banking revenues were $228 million in the fourth quarter, up more than 20% versus last year, reflecting higher net interest income from strong growth in deposits and higher loan balances.
While still in early stages of growth, our consumer business generated a total of $864 million in revenues for the firm this year from a standing start just three-years ago.
For the full-year 2019, we reported NII of $4.4 billion, up 16% driven by deposit and loan growth in Consumer & Wealth Management, increased lending in Investment Banking, as well as more lending activity in Global Markets.
Our total operating expenses of $7.3 billion increased $2.1 billion versus the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting higher compensation and litigation expense in the quarter, as well as our continued investment for growth.
While investments in technology and new businesses, including specifically Marcus, Apple Card, Transaction Banking, and United Capital, added another 300 basis points.
For the full-year, the total pretax impact of our organic business projects, including Marcus, Apple Card, and Transaction Banking is approximately $700 million resulting in a drag of roughly 70 basis points on our ROE.
Now, turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the year at $993 billion, essentially unchanged versus the third-quarter and up 7% versus last year, driven by higher plan activity and areas of growth across the firm.
That initiative comprised a number of important efforts on which we continue to execute, including client expansion in investment banking, wallet share growth in global markets, consumer loan and deposit growth, lending and financing deployment and asset management growth.
As we go forward, we will continue to execute on these initiatives but our focus and communication will instead reflect more ambitious firmwide performance targets to be introduced on Investor Day. These targets will also reflect growth opportunities that were not included in the original $5 billion, such as transaction banking and credit cards.
In conclusion, our fourth quarter was strong, leading to full-year performance that was in line with the evolving macro environment and reflective of our continued investment in new businesses.
I think broadly speaking in lending, I would say mindful of the cycle; our clear plan is to grow financing revenues in both FICC and equities to answer your direct question.
But I think equally important Investor Day will be the beginning and not the end of a dialogue around this so that the numbers just don't stand alone and we give you context for rate of growth and how we're managing it.
About $100 million of that was found in the Consumer &Wealth management business and the vast majority of that was related to provisioning to the growth in Apple Card.
The balance of the $390 million call it $300 million or so related to impairments on loans across a variety of different segments, Asset Management being one, Investment Banking being the other, and that was around corporate wholesale credit, it involved impairments across a range of different industries, most notably in energy, some in manufacturing, none of which were material in the context of the firm.
In terms of your question on the height of investment, I have said and would reiterate here that 2019 is the depth of investment, when you look at investment across three of our discrete products, namely Marcus, Apple Card, and Transaction Banking, and equally I've made that reference and again, reiterate here excluding the reserve calculation which I obviously spoke of in the context of the prepared remarks.
Obviously, in the context of flat expenses year-over-year, our hope and expectation is that we'll start to see higher revenue generation from some of these investments, which will play out positively in the context of the efficiency ratio itself.
I was hoping you could speak to what inning youÃÂÃÂre in currently, just in terms of the platform build out and new investment for that strategy specifically and just through the cycle, how we could think about long-term pretax margin potential for that segment, as you continue to scale and maybe begin to run a bit closer to some of the peer comps?
I'd also say and I'll reflect on this here generally but more specifically in our Investor Day, our intent is not to leave you in the dark as to the Consumer & Wealth management segment in terms of overall margins, meaning, we want to give you a sense of where the wealth business sits that is the PWM business, which obviously demonstrates a much higher margin than what the segment reveals with the segment being in effect burdened by the continued growth in investment spend in the consumer space.
I would say a lot of that reflects continued growth in the Apple Card portfolio as well as lending more generally but again as you grow from a negligible level at the inception through to what we hold both in terms of roughly $1.9 billion of where we are and what that growth will be in the ensuing year.
But equally we obviously look at the totality of lending that's going on and the rate of growth as it relates to the overall balance sheet and the firm itself.
Yes, actually my question is related to that last one, which is looking at the Asset Management segment and the $22 billion of mainly private equity investments.
You also had a very strong fourth quarter for equity investment performance, which I would think I have a lower comp ratio to it.
I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.
Today, I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr.
These conditions contributed to a supportive market making backdrop relative to a year-ago.
Secured or collateralized financing activity on behalf of institutional clients of our securities business is now reflected in FICC and equities financing within our Global Market segment.
This segment houses both GSEM and our merchant banking activities for Asset Management clients, supporting our third-party alternatives business expansion.
For the full-year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7.6 billion, our second highest ever down 7% from a record 2018 reflecting lower industry deal volumes.
Fourth quarter financial advisory revenues of $855 million were up 23% sequentially, but down 29% versus last year consistent with lower industry volumes.
For the year, we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting supported by $68 billion of deal volumes across more than 375 transactions.
In currencies, net revenues improved versus last year amidst a better geopolitical backdrop despite lower volatility.
Financing activity remains a strategic priority for the business, given it has historically exhibited attractive returns and considerable adjacent benefits to our broader equities franchise, particularly for our growing systematic client base.
Fourth quarter management and other fees related to client assets under supervision totaled $666 million, up 6% versus a year-ago offset by lower incentive fees.
Net revenues from lending activities in Asset Management were $427 million and primarily relate to loans backed by commercial and residential real estate.
Now let's turn to Page 9 for our firmwide assets under supervision.
And question two on that is how quickly can you expect those to a) grow and b) enhanced returns over the next year or two?
But when I look at sort of the NII disclosure on Page 10, it looks like only 15% of NII comes from Asset Management.
ThatÃÂÃÂs okay, thank you, helpful.
With respect to your second question, there were no material asset purchases that impacted global markets.
But just given expectations for a healthy step-up in provision, simply due to CECL implementation and some loan -- consumer loan seasoning, I was hoping you could maybe just help us frame a bit better, what's a reasonable provision level or run rate expectation if there's no change in the macro, but we simply have to reflect the impact of CECL with an assumption that you'll see relatively steady growth in consumer loans?
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
And then just one big picture question both David and you Stephen mentioned what functioning and constructive capital markets.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
",40.82,0.8249544
goldmansachs,q1,2020,"For our part to help support corporate financing needs, we are proud that in recent weeks we have reopened markets and underwritten a record amount of U.S. dollar investment grade debt for clients.
We delivered solid growth in FICC and equities on high levels of client engagement as we extended balance sheet liquidity to clients during the most volatile markets in March.
In asset management, we saw direct impact from market dislocation as our on-balance sheet equity and debt investments experienced material mark-to-market losses from falling asset prices.
Turning to the operating environment on Page 3, the financial markets started the year on solid footing fueled by continued economic growth and strong consumer sentiment.
Given our strong financial position, we were able to commit our balance sheet on behalf of clients and support strong volumes across our global market franchise as investors sought to reduce risk exposure.
Looking forward, our economists expect a very significant near-term decline in growth followed by a rebound in the second half of the year when they expect us to get back about 50% of the decline in output that we lose in the first two quarters.
In our high net worth business, we completed our re-branding of United Capital, the Goldman SachsÃÂÃÂ personal financial management on schedule in March, and our strong growth in consumer deposits continues to underscore the strategic importance of that business.
During the first quarter, three of our four business segments produced revenue growth in excess of 20% versus the year ago period reflecting the strength of our franchise and the elevated level of activity in March.
These results were offset by losses in our asset management business due to the significant decline in the fair value of our long-term investments in equity, debt securities, and loans.
Despite the difficult backdrop, our overall revenue levels remained relatively flat versus a year ago, reflecting the diversification of our businesses.
Before turning specifically to our results, I want to reflect for a moment on the financial strength of the firm and the U.S. banking system coming into this period of volatility, in terms of capital, liquidity and risk.
During the time of increased market volatility and disruption, our ability to seamlessly serve our clients, while the vast majority of our employees work remotely demonstrates the dedication of our people, the strength of our engineering and our business resiliency in addition to the financial standing of the organization.
Given the new set of challenges facing a variety of industries, we expect client demand to evolve as they seek our assistance, bolstering balance sheets, hedging market and financial risks, and capturing strategic opportunities.
Our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our Number 4 global debt underwriting league table ranking and our ability to provide clients access to the investment grade and below investment grade markets, even through the challenging environment in March.
Of that, Goldman Sachs helped raise nearly $75 billion of financing for clients, capturing over 13% share, roughly double versus last year, evidencing our client engagement and commitment to market access.
Revenues from corporate lending were $442 million, nearly double the fourth quarter and up over three-fold versus a year ago, driven by approximately $375 million of hedge gains relating to our relationship lending book on wider credit spreads during the quarter.
Moving to Global Markets on Page 6, net revenues were $5.2 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially and up 28% versus last year.
Within FICC intermediation, we saw elevated client flows across all of our businesses, with four out of five business lines posting higher first quarter net revenues versus last year; again, reflecting the value of our standing commitment to a diversified FICC franchise.
In currencies, we saw a very active quarter with meaningful revenue improvement as higher volatility drove significantly higher client volume and strong performance in the Americas and Asia.
We continued to on-board new clients to our Marquee and eFX platforms during the quarter, and produced record results in this business, reflecting our significant investments in recent years, changing client workflows, and our willingness to provide liquidity during market stress.
Like in our currencies business, our technology platforms in credit enabled us to serve clients in period of market dislocation with both buyers and sellers benefiting from our global franchise, capital commitment, and the efficiency of our digital platforms.
Lastly in FICC financing, we saw a considerable strength in our repo business as we helped clients navigate dislocated funding markets, which have begun to normalize in recent weeks.
Moving to asset management on Page 8, collectively, our asset management activities produced negative net revenues of $96 million in the first quarter, first quarter management and other fees totaled $640 million, up 5% versus a year ago, driven by higher client assets under supervision.
Our equity investments produced $22 million of net losses in the first quarter as material gains generated on the pending or close sale of certain investments in January and February were more than offset by broader markdowns on our public and private equity holdings in March.
Gains from these dispositions were offset by approximately $500 million of marks on our private equity positions, reflecting the underlying operating performance of the businesses and roughly $500 million of marks on our $2 billion public equity portfolio including $180 million loss on Avantor and significantly smaller losses across the broader portfolio.
Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in Asset Management were a negative $868 million attributable to mark to market losses on debt securities and fair value loans.
That said, in the first quarter, the fair market value component of the portfolio managed by these teams incurred significant credit spread widening which more than offset the ongoing net interest income from the portfolio itself.
Turning to Consumer and Wealth Management on Page 10, we produced $1.5 billion of revenues in the first quarter, up 6% versus the fourth quarter and up 21% versus a year ago, driven by higher average assets under supervision, increased transaction volumes and incentive fees and higher consumer banking revenues from deposits and lending products.
For the quarter, wealth management and other fees of $959 million rose 21% versus last year, reflecting both organic growth and the United Capital acquisition.
Consumer banking revenues were $282 million in the first quarter, rising nearly 40% versus last year, reflecting higher net interest income from strong growth in deposits and credit card loan balances.
Going forward, we expect to see a more modest level of growth in both Marcus unsecured loans and Apple Card as we seek to manage our risk profile and reduce the pace of origination during this period of market and economic dislocation.
Total firm-wide net interest income was $1.3 billion for the first quarter, up 23% sequentially, reflected in global markets and consumer given the impact of lower funding costs and continued deposit growth.
In conclusion, our first quarter results reflected the volatile operating environment and our ability to navigate turbulent markets and support our client franchise.
In answering your question, I will point out what we did in this quarter, because I think it will reflect a process that we will continue to look at which is we weigh a variety of macroeconomic scenarios, one thatÃÂÃÂs optimistic, a base case and one thatÃÂÃÂs downside in a quarter in which we sat and if circumstances played we heavily weighted a downside scenario that doesnÃÂÃÂt rely exclusively on our economist, but takes a broad look.
And just to give you a little bit of insight into that, of that private portfolio, I would say 65% of it continued to perform well in the context of operating performance in the business, about 20% of that portfolio was impacted by COVID and was the source of a considerable number of the private marks taken and then 15% of portfolio was whatÃÂÃÂs on positive gains in the harvesting that was there.
In this quarter, you saw all people that operate the intermediation businesses benefit from higher volatility and more client activity.
And so I would just point out as an example in the context of the consumer book wherever committed to that business, but at this moment, in this environment we will be quite cautious in terms of credit extension and growing that book and will return to grow that book once this sort of circumstance and market volatility passes just as an example of how risk needs to be the governor in the context of managing this profile and the loan book overall.
And then just as a follow-up, results in trading and banking held up well and I realized itÃÂÃÂs impossible to predict or to have too much clarity, but can you help us out or provide some context or color on where you are continuing to see elevated activity versus the areas where we could expect some normalization or falloff just given some of the pockets that we have seen over the past 9 months?
And I think particularly in this market and most notably in March, this was a really good very stable source of funding for us, but I think the forward trajectory both as a strategy and then equally as it relates to our ability to harvest the kind of savings that we have talked about over the medium term is one that we are going to continue to adhere to and watch and achieve.
I guess first question here on just some of the puts and takes of the move in interest rates and obviously Goldman is going to be less levered to interest rate movements in some of the large banks, but just with the dramatic shift across the curve in the back half of the quarter, just if you can maybe help us think about some of the implications of the move on the model going forward whether it be on funding or revenues and then any other second derivatives, sounds like debt issuance might be one area of the benefits, but anything else we should be thinking about?
I will just come back to the commentary I made before, which is $19 billion of private equity positions, two-thirds of that portfolio in the context of our look and evaluation of their operating performance continued to perform well.
And I think the portfolio is obviously intended to hold up that well that way, but itÃÂÃÂs not immune by any means from broader macroeconomic circumstances and the marks will reflect the sort of assessment of performance as we move through uncertain quarters.
In addition, we launched a COVID-19 relief fund with $30 million commitment through Goldman Sachs Gives, including a special employee matching grant program to help healthcare workers, families and the most vulnerable populations.
Our business performed well in both January and February as markets notched new highs driven by client confidence in activity.
We also witnessed significant widening of credit spreads in both investment grade and high yield and de-risking from clients across all asset classes.
Helping clients access public market financing windows also enabled us to better risk manage our portfolio of acquisition finance commitments, as certain bridge in other facilities were taken out in permanent financings in the capital markets.
These deposit balances totaled $9 billion and weÃÂÃÂre now serving over 80 clients, reflecting the early diversification benefits of our new business growth strategy.
Growth was driven by significantly higher client activity amid wider bid-ask spreads and solid risk management in a challenging market.
Our rates franchise also performed well, given high levels of client intermediation and despite the challenge of managing risk positions through a significant jump in volatility as central banks around the world cut rates and the Fed and ECB launched significant quantitative easing programs.
We benefited from significantly higher client activity in more liquid index CDS products and notably in client portfolio trades, which more than offset the impact of wider credit spreads amid lower liquidity in cash product trading inventory.
Equities intermediation net revenues of $1.5 billion rose 32% versus a year ago aided by derivatives given higher equity market volatility and significantly higher client volumes.
This portfolio includes a range of investing activities executed by our private credit group and multi-strategy investing teams, which have historically generated solid contributions to firm performance over many years.
Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $128 billion, up $19 billion sequentially driven primarily by funded commercial revolvers in investment banking as I noted earlier.
In our consumer portfolio, provisions related to markets were higher versus last quarter due primarily to CECL reserve rates even though realized net charge-offs declined.
Additionally, we note out provisions during the quarter were impacted by higher levels of reserving for new loan growth under CECL which we adopted as planned.
Our total quarterly operating expenses of $6.5 billion increased 10% versus last year driven by significantly higher brokerage clearing and exchange fees attributable to higher client activity.
[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
I am just looking forward how are you thinking about loan growth both in terms of customer demand and your risk appetite to lend into global recession?
Good morning and thanks for taking the questions.
We have seen a lot of your competitors aggressively match the Fed rate cuts, but you maintained very competitive deposit payouts, certainly help contribute to strong deposit growth this quarter.
Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
I am sorry I wanted to circle back on the provision assumptions, I know you have spoken about it a couple of times, but itÃÂÃÂs just so little confusing to me because I am not ÃÂÃÂ you have referenced sort of what the Goldman Sachs economists think, but it seemed as though you suggested thatÃÂÃÂs not what was necessarily an input into your own provision assumptions?
Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Your next question is from the line of Jeremy Sigee with Exane BNP Paribas.
I just wondered if you could talk more about what your expectations are for total balance sheet assets expanding further in the next couple of quarters and also risk weighted assets.

google,q2,2015,"Ruth Porat aÂÂ Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Key highlights this quarter include ongoing momentum in our core search business particularly mobile, complemented by significant growth in YouTube revenues.
These strong top-line results were complemented by ongoing operating expense discipline in the quarter as reflected in 31% year-over-year growth in GAAP operating income and 16% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating income.
YouTube again delivered substantial growth in user engagement globally, particularly on mobile, which translated into strong adoption of our TrueView ad format.
Our programatic business including AdExchange and DoubleClick Bid Manager continue to deliver strong year-over-year and sequential performance then more than offset lower results in AdSense for Search.
Network paid clicks were down 9% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially reflecting the impact of our ongoing policy changes designed to reduce the lower quality inventory on AdSense for Search consistent with our focus on improving user experience.
Year-on-year and sequential growth were driven by costs associated with operating our data centers including deprecation as well as content acquisition cost primarily for YouTube and Play.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.4 billion, or 30% of revenue, up 11% year-over-year and down 1% versus Q1.
Google Play games has added more than 180 million new users in the past six months and continues to be one of the fastest growing mobile gaming platforms in history.
In addition, weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing strong momentum around Google Cloud platform, with a range of great new features, new major customer announcements like HTC and JDA software and our collaboration with Broad Institute.
And on the advertising side as a trend towards programatic ad buying continues, weÃ¢ÂÂre helping clients succeed in a multi-screen world with our DoubleClick platform.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre investing in creating great mobile experiences for people across Google products.
In addition, our teams have made great strides to help users find what they need within third-party apps through indexing.
Alongside our efforts to make mobile better for users, weÃ¢ÂÂre continuing to help marketers succeed in todayÃ¢ÂÂs mobile world.
For instance at I/O we recently announced universal app campaigns, which will let developers easily reach users across Google search, the add mob network, mobile sites, YouTube and Google Play.
As consumers continue to shift their content consumption from television to digital, brand dollars are flowing Ã¢ÂÂ I am sorry following, which weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing an upfront buying through our Google preferred model.
And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Duetsche Bank.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JP Morgan.
On the first part on this online to offline conversion efforts, we obviously know that mobile activities are influencing offline behavior and weÃ¢ÂÂre very busy investing in new dynamic products that help bring mobile users to stores.
Our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.
Can you just help us understand or are you seeing both accelerate Ã¢ÂÂ is U.S. search accelerating at this point or is it more so being driven by YouTube?
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
So mobile, CPCs strengthening desktop not declining, YouTube remains lower, but weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing real strong growth in TrueView.
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovations, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Network revenue was $3.6 billion, up 2% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the diversion performance of programatic on the one hand and our legacy network businesses on the other.
In terms of the drivers within Google sites paid clicks were up 30% year-over-year, and up 10% sequentially in particular reflecting growth in YouTube TrueView as well as in mobile.
Our strong revenue growth in the second quarter, notwithstanding the adverse effects of the strong U.S. dollar evidences the health of our core search business most notably mobile, complemented by growth in YouTube and programmatic advertising.
I want to quickly share a few highlights of the past quarter and then spend more time talking about our progress in what continues to be our two biggest focus areas and growth drivers: mobile and video.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre also seeing great adoption of our video ad formats like TrueView and continue to help marketers engage and connect the consumers in new ways.
So as you can see itÃ¢ÂÂs been a very busy and successful quarter, we are super focus on our key goals of delivering amazing mobile and video experiences and there is lot more coming in the next few months including the Android M release, now on tap Android Pay, and YouTube gaming.
As I said in our view, our infrastructure is one of the most strategic assets that we have and as we talk about what happened in the second quarter it reflects the fact that there can be some variability in the cadence of spend and so while overall capital intensity was lower in Q2 than in prior year and prior quarter, thatÃ¢ÂÂs a more an issue of how spend is faced during the year but the main point as we do computing capacity as a strategic asset it provides us with the flexibility necessary for growth.
Omid, the U.S. reaccelerated looks like from 12% to 16% in the quarter, can you just give us a little color of what drove that was it more a function of core search and mobile picking up or Ã¢ÂÂ for YouTube?
We have strength in core search obviously and in particularly mobile, YouTube and programmatic weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing a lot of strength.
And so as I noted weÃ¢ÂÂre just starting the 2016 budgeting process, in my experience the best way to slow the rate of growth in expenses is to work closely with business leaders really anchored in data, so together we can identify ways to prioritize resources and really continue to extend the discipline that weÃ¢ÂÂve talked about.
So starting with your question about cash which Ã¢ÂÂ and whether we would issue debt, I think, the way I look at that is youÃ¢ÂÂre talking about overall efficiency of balance sheet and how are we using the balance sheet and IÃ¢ÂÂve slightly broadened the question more than what you did, but at the end of the day, our focus Ã¢ÂÂ my focus is maximizing shareholder value over the medium to long-term and that is about how effectively are we using our balance sheet where we investing and that could theoretically be a part of that.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs a good question and in fact thatÃ¢ÂÂs one of the areas that I really focused on after I came back and, it is a suite of products thatÃ¢ÂÂs we are very proud of and working well for advertisers and what we like to say internally, as we like to have one Google represented to the customers so that in these conversations with them we really understand their objectives and really in the classic sense of the funnel you know we can start from the brand journey from the beginning to purchase across, search display video and then as you know we recently brought cross-device measurement to DoubleClick.
Omid, you gave a lot of great data points on the growth in YouTube and stuff thatÃ¢ÂÂs accelerated could you spend little bit more time on the why has YouTube seen this kind of reacceleration resurgence in growth.
Do you think its part of a broader industry trend, the weakness in the upfront, offline is now coming online or is what else specifically, what specifically is YouTube doing to kind of better capture those dollars and then Ruth I know somebody ask you about that, logical follow-on question is the cash returns and share repurchases and dividends and just I know its early days but your thoughts on and your collective thoughts, Google how you think about that over the next few years when if ever it make logical sense to do that?
So its Ã¢ÂÂ I think itÃ¢ÂÂs really combination of all of the strength of YouTube coming together it starts with having over a billion users nearly almost one-third of all people on the internet everyday watching hundreds of millions of hours on the services and that creates billions of views and as Ruth mentioned the growth in watch time on YouTube accelerated in this now up over 60% year-over-year the fastest weÃ¢ÂÂve seen in couple of years.
And as I said, the allocation decisions are mutually exclusive, the profitability of our business gives us many opportunities, but the main point is to date the weakest return on investment here has been in our core search business including mobile search as a result of both smart M&A and CapEx. Here M&A, we built a lot of the growth engines today, YouTube and DoubleClick are great examples.
It remains a good contributor to overall results as we announced that the AdWords performance Summit in May ongoing developments in rich and useful ads that work across all screams including desktop, enable us to deliver the right answers for our users in the right moment in other words, ads format that accelerate time to conversion on both mobile and desktop and thatÃ¢ÂÂs whatÃ¢ÂÂs really narrowing this gap here.
And then the second one just going back to the accelerating U.S. revenue growth, it sounds like mobile and YouTube are both doing pretty well.
In terms of overall kind of the framework for thinking about our businesses broadly, I think a valuable framework to use is one that Eric and Larry have referred to for many years, namely the 70/20/10, 70% resources on the core 20% on adjacent areas, one point that included Chrome and Android and they are now in the core but it would include things like cloud and then 10% in additional new exciting opportunities in really sizable markets like Viber or what weÃ¢ÂÂre doing with Google Life Sciences.
So human nature sort of provides a limit on how big that final bucket would be the new opportunities and I think the other point to consider is the GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs core business continues to deliver strong growth.
Well, youÃ¢ÂÂve covered a lot of it, the U.S. growth really reflects the fact we have diverse set of products that are doing well, we had strengthen core search particularly mobile, we had strengthen YouTube and programatic as Omid talked about.
And then the other thing I wanted to ask is just thinking about the CapEx spending made that companies go through and clearly Google been on one on an accelerated spending way for the last few years, should we then suggest Ã¢ÂÂ get from your comments are you were in a digestion period that the digestion period could also be a multi-year trend as well, if there is any thoughts you could share there.
And then in terms of the second part of your question, I think, itÃ¢ÂÂs important to help our stakeholders understand how we think about key drivers of the business and how we manage the business, providing what I call a framework for understanding the momentum in the business, our investment choices, our capital allocation decision making.
In terms of the revenue growth in YouTube, Omid hit a number of them, but we continue to have strong growth there and it really does reflect as he said the sheer volume of users we have over a billion users.
",41.06,0.87799054
google,q3,2015,"I would now like to introduce your host for todayÃ¢ÂÂs conference, Ellen West, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Let me now turn to key elements of our financial statements, starting with our primary revenue sources.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a significant rate with growth driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred.
Google site CPCs were down 16% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.7 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% year-over-year and up 7% versus Q2.
Working with over 30 publication and technology partners we recently announced an open source initiative called Accelerated Mobile Pages to make it easy for publishers and content creators to build superfast webpages for their content.
Another example is the Google photos app, which leverages powerful machine learning technology to help people discover, organize and share their photos.
WeÃ¢ÂÂll continue to invest in large open ecosystems that weÃ¢ÂÂve build with partners to reach great scale.
Advertisers like DunkinÃ¢ÂÂ Donuts and Airbnb are turning to mobile search to capitalize on these key moments reach customers, and create engaging local experiences.
We also recently made search ads in Google Play available to all developers letting app developers find new customers for their app at a great price where it matters.
We are also helping marketers understand how Search ads are driving in-store sales with products like Store Visits which uses our unique mobile location capabilities and is easy for any business to implement.
And we continue to invest in building ways for marketers to reach consumers effectively, like our recently announced shopping ads for YouTube, which lets people shop directly from a video, turning any relevant video into your digital storefront.
In the third quarter, we crossed 1 million paying active customers using Google Drive at Work.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank.
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
Can you share with us the way in which youÃ¢ÂÂre approaching budgeting versus maybe how it was done last year?
And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley Your line is now open.
IÃ¢ÂÂm so curious about the various business models youÃ¢ÂÂre now putting in front of consumers, subscription versus advertising versus paper unit like on Google Play.
And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Can you see anything then it maybe in terms of the success with the efficiency that youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in terms of text based mobile ads versus more of the other structured data ones thatÃ¢ÂÂs around like part of glycerin [ph] or hotel price ads and so forth?
And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.
I had two questions that are kind of interrelated around mobile apps.
And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian form Robert W.
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding AlphabetÃ¢ÂÂs future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
The key highlight this quarter was the substantial growth of our mobile search revenue complemented by ongoing strong contributions from YouTube and our programmatic business.
Sundar will then review the business and product highlights of the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth reflect substantial strength in mobile search due to ongoing improvement in ad formats and delivery to better address how consumers use their mobile devices.
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 4% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, continuing to reflect the significant growth of Programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses.
Year-over-year growth was driven by Google for Work, including cloud, as well as continued strong growth in Play.
Specifically, we intend to disclose for both Google and Other Bets revenues profitability and CapEx. By doing this we expect that you will be better able to understand how we manage the businesses, including the pace and allocation of our investments.
First, in terms of revenues are strong revenue growth in Q3 reflects the ongoing momentum in Google with acceleration in mobile search complemented by the strength of YouTube and programmatic.
Second, with respect to profitability, we remain focused on managing expenses within our control, while investing to support the growth areas we have in Google and Other Bets.
Products like Search, Android, Maps, Chrome and YouTube each have over a billion users already, and Google Play crossed that milestone this quarter as well.
Today, I want to touch on three key areas that are important for us; first, making information accessible and useful; then how we are building computing platforms used by billions of people; and lastly, how we are driving growth in our core advertising business as well as new emerging businesses.
We are also seeing strong mobile momentum in many emerging markets like India, which is a number two country for mobile search queries behind the U.S. This is the result of a laser focus on helping users quickly find the right information.
And our machine learning is hard at work in mobile services like Now on Tap, which quickly assist you by providing additional useful information for whatever youÃ¢ÂÂre doing, right in the moment, anywhere on your phone.
Now I want to talk about how weÃ¢ÂÂre building computing platforms that are used by billions of people.
First, digital content, Google Play continues to be a thriving hub for our digital content business, now with over 1 billion users.
Two questions, could you talk about the sustainability of the mobile search revenue growth that you see there?
And when we look, if you step back, overall sites revenue, weÃ¢ÂÂre firing on all cylinders, really strong growth in mobile, desktop is healthy and continuing to grow.
Especially with mobile I think you have a computing platform thatÃ¢ÂÂs going to reach, itÃ¢ÂÂs already reached half the worldÃ¢ÂÂs population or on its way to reach the entirety of the human population in about five to 10 years.
So want to stay focused on that both from information standpoint and a computing standpoint, I think of them as two sides of the same coin, and making sure we are building the right user experience for that.
I think with our move to segment reporting, we look forward to giving you more information next quarter which should be helpful there, but directionally to talk about philosophically how do we think about our approach to the business.
So I think really what was very encouraging for me is there is a framework, a very strong approach to financial planning and analysis, and really building on that to make sure we have reasonable but tight envelope so that we can have the right conversations collectively, collaboratively with our business leaders to assess how we can look at optimizing all of our resources, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what it really comes down to, itÃ¢ÂÂs looking at how to manage the rate of growth of expenses, while still supporting our growth initiatives and weÃ¢ÂÂll be going into more of that in as we go through our segment reporting in the fourth quarter.
Mobile gives us very unique opportunities in terms of better understanding users and over time as we use things like machine learning, I think we can make great strides.
So my long-term view on this is, it is ask compelling or in fact even better than the desktop, but it will take us time to get there, and weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be focused to be get that.
So if you take something like YouTube, we expect most users to consume, YouTube debate has been and advertising has been a strong part of providing the content for free to those users, and itÃ¢ÂÂs growing very, very well, but we also see a need for certain users, in certain scenarios be it music or gaming or for premium content to experience it in a different way.
I think thatÃ¢ÂÂs an important part of that we have an extraordinary set of opportunities, not just within Google but across the Alphabet businesses, and we need to ensure that prioritization is a key part of all that that we do.
When we look forward to the fourth quarter, in particular given the hardware launches that weÃ¢ÂÂve done here with the Nexus Chromecast and Pixel launches, a consistent with prior device launches we would expect higher sales and marketing and I realized IÃ¢ÂÂm getting a little more specific than your question, but I think itÃ¢ÂÂs very important to note that there are also certain patterns to some of these similarly with CapEx, CapEx is - itÃ¢ÂÂs been a bit more muted here.
And I think, itÃ¢ÂÂs just, itÃ¢ÂÂs been an extraordinary experience joining this team, I think the with the move to Alphabet it gives us the opportunity to then provide some greater insight into the extraordinary operating performance within Google and breakouts you can see the investments that weÃ¢ÂÂre doing and weÃ¢ÂÂre working very tightly as a senior team here as we make that next step into this new environment in Alphabet.
The interesting thing, weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing is, when we talk about mobile, mobile is a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of his desktop today as well.
But as weÃ¢ÂÂve said weÃ¢ÂÂre looking at how consumer behavior is changing and just as it did on desktop weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing the same on mobile and the notion of trying to make sure were being as useful as possible for users is key driver and weÃ¢ÂÂll continue to innovate.
I think itÃ¢ÂÂs important to understand that ads today fun almost all the services which people use, including products like Google Search, Google Maps many, many third-party products.
And then, in terms of your M&A question, I talked about how did we think of sizing the return, I started with whatÃ¢ÂÂs really most quarter as which is continuing to focus on the biggest problems and solving them at scale, and ensuring that weÃ¢ÂÂre investing in those.
How should we think about businesses that currently are in the Other Bets line that may continue to growing.
Sundar, so I think it was on a conference call about three years ago when Larry articulated a vision of a simple and consistent consumer experience from Google, and the same for your advertising customers as well.
And then, if youÃ¢ÂÂre focusing on the other cost to revenue line, the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth was driven by ongoing data center operations, including depreciation thatÃ¢ÂÂs in there as well, as well as content acquisition costs, as you said primarily YouTube and Play.
On the first one, or maybe youÃ¢ÂÂre specifically talking about the mobile search experience on Google.com or the Google app, but we are seeing the same traction within Maps or YouTube.
And even things like Gmail are playing a critical role in Google for Work and how we are driving big business opportunities as well.
",49.28,0.82270956
google,q4,2015,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
With a move to our new Alphabet structure, we conducted a detailed review of business opportunities and investment levels across Google and Other Bets.
In light of our move to segment reporting, I'm going to present to you in this order: first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.9 billion in Q4, up 24% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs due to the launch of our new Nexus, Chromecast, and Pixel devices.
Given their stages of development, these businesses will have idiosyncrasies with respect to the timing of revenue, expenses, and CapEx resulting from milestones, partnerships, and other factors.
Starting with the Google segment, which includes our Search and Ads business as well as related businesses such as Play, Hardware and Cloud and Apps, as well as our newer efforts within Google such as Machine Learning and Virtual Reality, Google revenue was $21.2 billion, up 18% year over year.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $14.9 billion in the quarter, up 20% year over year, and up 14% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds.
Network revenue was $4.1 billion, up 7% year-on-year and up 12% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of Programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses.
The movement in Google Sites paid clicks and CPCs primarily reflects the continued growth in YouTube TrueView.
CapEx for the quarter was $1.8 billion, reflecting investments in data center construction, production equipment and facilities.
Other Bets CapEx was $869 million for the full-year, primarily reflecting investment in our Fiber business.
We continue to invest in longer-term opportunities within both Google and Other Bets, consistent with our emphasis on pushing the frontier to adjacent areas and moon shots.
Notably, in many ways, some of Alphabet's biggest moon shots are in Google itself, from driving the next wave of computing through machine learning, capitalizing on the shift to the cloud by enterprises, building platforms like virtual reality and pursuing the opportunities we see with the next billion users in emerging markets, you should expect Google to continue to invest in efforts to improve life for billions of people.
We view our computing capacity as a core competence and will continue to invest here given our advantages in providing efficient, secure computing to support growth in both our consumer products and services globally as well as our Cloud and Apps businesses.
Above all, our Q4 results show the great momentum and opportunity we have in mobile search and across Google's range of businesses.
First, on our last call, I shared that six of our consumer products, Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, and Google Play, all have over a billion monthly active users each.
We have focused a lot on really improving search in mobile and now we are investing in evolving this to actively assist our users throughout the day in smart and helpful ways.
We had particularly strong growth in this area in countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia and Mexico, thanks to continued investments in payments capabilities.
Our data centers have handled the workload of Google's own products from Search to YouTube for 17 years.
I want to say thank you to all of the Googlers around the world for their amazing work, from Cloud computing, digital video, and the mobile revolution, to machine learning, virtual reality, and helping the next billion get online.
So looking at the pace of progress, I think we will have AI in a form in which it benefits a lot of users in the coming years, but I still think it's early days, and there's a long-term investment for us.
The story continues to be about strong growth in video advertising, TrueView and Google Preferred as distinct from Display on YouTube.
As you look at some of the numbers, the reason I said it's more instructive to look at annual or rolling 12 months is that there can be some lumpy things on a quarterly basis, but we're continuing to invest across the businesses as we talked about.
And then, on the Other Bets business, clearly, and you mentioned milestones a couple of times, the losses have really increased over the last two quarters.
When we look at the scale of mobile for the first time in our lifetime, so I think we have a platform which is going to reach one day the entirety of the world's population, so it will be over 5 billion users.
And then in terms of CapEx, you've noted the important difference on a year-over-year basis a couple of sizable real estate items as part of our facilities expansion that we called out last year on top of continued investment in our technical infrastructure.
But really to the heart of your question, looking ahead for 2016, we do expect to see accelerated investment in CapEx, and that's to support both Google and Other Bets.
And for Google, that is intended to continue to support growth in our consumer products and services globally as well as all that we're doing for our enterprise clients, as Sundar has already talked about, so CapEx in both areas there.
And then, secondly, Ruth, on the core Google business, we've seen roughly 300 basis points of margin expansion here over the last year or so.
In the near term, given the growth in viewership, YouTube TrueView CPC pricing is expected to continue to affect our overall Sites monetization mix.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. So in terms of CPCs, other than YouTube, I guess, the other comments to add are in the fourth quarter, we did see an impact from the ad format changes that we talked about in the third quarter.
Revenue momentum in Q4 underscored the strength of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth accelerating meaningfully versus last year.
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial operational performance, total revenue was $21.3 billion, up 18% year over year and up 14% sequentially.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.6 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% year over year and up 15% versus Q3, primarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago.
Adjusting for stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 22% versus last year.
Our cash balance reflects the impact of seasonal working capital requirements and our repurchase during the quarter of approximately 2.4 million shares of Alphabet Class C stock for a total repurchase amount of $1.8 billion.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.1 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 14% sequentially and up 12% year over year.
We are working diligently to build additional businesses that create long-term revenues, profits and value.
Given the early-stage nature of a number of these efforts, they are likely to require additional investment prior to generating meaningful revenues.
This comes thanks to our years of investments in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, knowledge graph and other areas.
From providing Internet access in India's railway stations to making Chromebooks available throughout the region, it reinforced what a huge opportunity we have to help the next 1 billion users come online and to have great experiences with the whole Internet once they are there.
Google helps advertisers reach the right customer at precisely the right micro-moment when they are looking to buy something, go somewhere, know something, or do something.
Shoppers turned to their mobile devices to purchase gifts online in spare moments throughout the day all season long, and marketers turned to our mobile ad offerings to reach those customers.
Not only were people using mobile ads to shop online, they also used their phones to find the best products and prices in stores around them.
Our local inventory ads help people see if a product they are looking for is in stock at a retailer nearby.
Our app promotion offerings like Universal App Campaigns, which help marketers easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, Search, and across our Display Network, are getting great traction and delivering results for advertisers.
We also continue to expand measurement options for marketers on YouTube to help them better understand the effectiveness of their ad spend.
Our business collaboration and productivity suite, Google Apps, now incorporates the best of Google's new technologies like machine learning and natural language processing.
Google has a front row seat on the trends that will define computing in the coming years.
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.
I was wondering if you could share with us when you were having conversations with corporate customers over the last 12 months, what were the biggest areas of change or things that they said Google needed to work on in order to win over their Cloud business versus, say, them choosing to go with an AWS or an Azure?
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.
Sundar, you just called out Gmail as the latest among your products to reach 1 billion users.
So big picture as you look at the next 1 billion users who want to come online and use your products, are you in any hurry to begin monetization at all?
Thanks for taking the questions, two things.
Our last question comes from Mark May from Citi.

google,q1,2016,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
We also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet search as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising.
The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers in areas where we've prioritized investment, such as cloud and apps.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $14.3 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially.
Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in Mobile Search due to the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad formats and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year.
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year and down 11% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset by the traditional network businesses.
The increase in both Sites TAC and Network TAC as a percentage of revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Because Other Bets results aggregate the revenues and expenses from a number of businesses operating in different industries, there is likely to be lumpiness in the reported results from quarter-to-quarter, which is why we think it remains most instructive to look at them over a longer time horizon.
With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, the bulk of that is directed to our Fiber business, where CapEx should obviously increase as we execute in a growing number of cities.
So my closing comment is that in Q1, we continued to see tremendous revenue growth across our businesses, and we remain focused on disciplined investing for the long-term.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc. Thanks, Ruth.
Our teams are off to a great start this year and there is even more excitement in the month ahead as we gear up for big events, like: our annual developer conference, Google I/O; our YouTube event, Brandcast; and the Google Performance Summit for advertisers.
A few highlights from the quarter; we continued to invest in making Search more useful and assistive.
We have made a lot of improvements over the years to add more comprehensive and assistive information right within the search results.
We are incredibly well-positioned to better assist our users, thanks to our strengths in areas like search, geographical information, machine learning, image recognition and natural language processing.
At Google, machine learning is already helping us improve our products every day in search and many other areas like photos, maps and more.
Second, we continue to invest in the best new mobile ad formats, tailored to help users find exactly what they need at the right moment.
As I think about all our businesses and each of the countries we reach, I have never been more excited about how our teams continue to bring this mission to life and make technology available for everyone.
So on the cost of sales or the gross margin trend, as I tried to make clear, certain costs associated with revenue are going up, given secular trends in the market, so in Sites, Mobile carries higher TAC than does desktop and Mobile remains a strong growth driver, so we do expect this to continue.
So it goes to my opening comments that we're focused on controlling the expenses we have, and then there are certain trends, as I noted, in particular on the TAC side, that have been increasing with the strong growth we're seeing in mobile and programmatic.
So on TAC, it's really the ongoing growth in Mobile, as I've kind of answered a couple of times here, and that reflects the strong secular trends behind mobile, so really nothing to add on on the Sites TAC side.
So, Sundar, I think it was at I/O last year when you started to call out the products which have over 1 billion users.
Just a few questions on YouTube; first, on the Preferred program, Ruth, you mentioned it sounds like the growth continues to be really strong there going into Brandcast.
As Sundar said, focused on answers; there are a lot of new ways to search on mobile, of course, voice, et cetera.
And then, Ruth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Mobile Search being driven by improvements in ad formats and delivery starting in the third quarter of last year.
We think there's a lot of opportunity to improve the experience that users have, and that's where the Fiber team is focused.
As I talked about on the last quarter call, we've really continued to refine and enhance our go-to-market strategy, the way we're working with cities, the way we're building out those cities and really the level of technology and innovation that we can use to differentiate the offering and are pleased with the ongoing efforts there.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc. So we've been doing these changes for a long time and so we try to roll it out globally, and that's what we did.
But I think, importantly, we are benefiting from an important secular trend behind Mobile, and like the revenue dollars and the gross profit dollars that come as a result of that, and we'll continue to innovate on mobile and are excited about the opportunity, in particular with all the changes that we continue to see in the way users use the phone and the opportunities.
Sundar, first off, you mentioned a lot of the ongoing projects at Google, but I wonder if you could share with us maybe the two or three areas that you're spending the most of your time on or are focused on?
Our very strong revenue of $20.3 billion in Q1 underscored the great momentum of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth again accelerating meaningfully, up 23% in constant currency versus last year.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.6 billion, up 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with operating our data centers including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and hardware costs related to sales of new Nexus, Chromecast and Pixel devices launched in the fall.
GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion in the quarter.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6 billion or 30% of revenue, up 11% year-over-year and down 9% versus Q4.
Non-GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 21% versus last year.
The key drivers this quarter were the ongoing drag from foreign exchange, given the volatility in currency markets as well as losses recorded for marketable and non-marketable securities.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from app promotion.
However, the secular trends driving revenue are accompanied by greater required investment in our ecosystem to support that revenue growth, most specifically the continued trend of higher TAC due to an ongoing change in mix within our Sites and Network businesses.
The team continues to deliver innovative solutions that are creating meaningful efficiencies in machine use, allowing us to benefit from earlier investments and meet our growing Google requirements cost effectively.
Finally, in certain areas where we have had multiple teams developing different approaches to a similar technology, we've been evaluating how to rationalize these approaches, enabling us to increase investments around a smaller, more focused set of opportunities.
Today, we show the live scores for nearly 200 soccer leagues across 70 countries, so fans around the world can quickly find information, like upcoming schedules, team news and conference standings right in the search results.
Game developers of all sizes are building successful businesses in the Play Store thanks to its global reach of over 1 billion users.
We recently made it easy to find AMP in relevant Mobile Search and Google News results, giving users a lightning-fast reading experience for top stories.
We expanded Android Auto to Brazil, and Android Wear partners, like Michael Kors and Fossil, also announced that they are working on new devices coming later this year.
Marketers like HBO Now are seeing great results from our popular app (23:10) promotion offerings like Universal App Campaigns, (23:13) which helps advertisers easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, Search and across our Display network.
As companies accelerate their move to the cloud, we can help them automate their IT operations, better understand their data, and become more cost effective and secure, while also offering them transformative office productivity.
It was wonderful to hear executives from Spotify and Coca-Cola share their stories about how they are benefiting from Google's cloud technology, including our best-in-class security, reliability and analytics.
I've been so proud to see us expanding our core products to more and more countries around the world: Street View in Sri Lanka; YouTube in Nepal and Pakistan; new Hindu keyboards (27:58) in India; and a new engineering center in Singapore that will help us get closer to the next billion users coming online by developing products that will work well for them.
Thanks for taking the questions, maybe just two, one on YouTube; you've now played around with the idea of original content, also injected a subscription offering into the marketplace.
Despite the increasing TAC as a percentage of revenues, adjusted operating income margins expanded now almost 130 bps and 140 bps for Google year-on-year.
And the second question, I think maybe for Sundar, can you talk a bit about the decision you took last year to have an additional ad on Mobile Search response pages relegating organic results below the fold?
And your next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
And then the OI&E line also includes changes in value where equity pickups related to marketable and nonmarketable securities and investments.
When you talk about CapEx with the Other Bets being primarily for Fiber, is this a fairly sort of straightforward passing of homes, or is your cash use going toward developing new technologies or products like SkyBender?
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
And your next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura.
Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc. Thanks for taking my questions.
Were those changes made globally last year in the third quarter?
And our final question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird.
And so thinking through about how computing evolves, be it emerging technologies like VR or how mobile advances over the next few years, so these are all areas where I do spend time on.
",51.21,0.84051955
google,q2,2016,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
I'm going to present to you in the following order: first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets; finally, I will conclude with our outlook.
Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.9 billion, up 28% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $15.4 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially.
Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in Mobile Search due to the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad format and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year.
First, regarding revenue, our Alphabet structure, announced nearly a year ago, gives us the framework for developing new sources of revenue growth within both Google and in Other Bets in a disciplined way.
We are continually working to enhance the search experience and making changes to our ads formats and tools, guided by substantial user testing.
In conclusion, in the second quarter we delivered very strong revenue growth and improved operating efficiency.
Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer, Google, Inc. Thanks, Ruth.
It's transformed the way that people consume information, and Google's products have become a central and much-loved part of their experience.
Thanks to advancements in machine learning, we have the unique opportunity to take a big step forward for the next 10 years.
You will be able to experience the Google Assistant in products like our new messaging app, Allo, and our voice-activated device, Google Home, and we can't wait to show you what else we are working on in this area.
Second, machine learning; as I said, machine learning is the engine that will drive our future, and it's already making our products better and helping users every day.
We are extraordinarily well positioned to take advantage of the mobile shift, and we are already seeing strong growth in three key areas of our advertising business, Mobile Search, Video, and Programmatic.
More generally, from advertising, to cloud, to digital content, to hardware, and to so much more, we have tremendous long-term growth opportunities at Google.
As you look at this increasing growth challenge on your product innovations in Search, including the recent changes and also those that you have in your roadmap for the next few years, how do you think about your ability to sustain such revenues growth and the trajectory over which they will ultimately decelerate?
And as Sundar and I both commented on, the biggest driver again this quarter was Mobile Search.
Then, as per your question, going back to that third quarter of 2015 when we made the change in ad formats on Mobile, our growth rate meaningfully accelerated.
And as we've noted in each subsequent quarter, that change has been the primary driver of the higher year-on-year revenue growth rate.
As the team discussed at the Google Performance Summit, we believe the changes should result in a better, more useful experience for users and better performance for advertisers.
And as we present our search results, we have long-term metrics for user happiness around which we make, that's the framework for all the changes we make.
Obviously, with the shift to mobile, the user experience, users are evolving in terms of how they use our product.
We also benefited from solid growth in Desktop and Tablet Search as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising.
Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of our business around the globe as well as the impact the currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business relative to last year.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.2 billion, or 29% of revenue, up 15% year-over-year and up 2% versus Q1.
Non-GAAP operating income was $7.5 billion, up 25% versus last year.
Stock-based compensation totaled $1.5 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased head count and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs every two years.
The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud and apps.
This performance reflects our strong operating cash flow, offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $1.6 billion, completing the authorization under our share repurchase program.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and increasingly Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager.
Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year on year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset by the traditional Network businesses.
The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely Mobile Search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
You've seen over the past few quarters how our focus on innovation can drive strong revenue growth.
Second, as to expenses, I've commented many times that our focus on long-term revenue growth does not give us a pass on managing expenses.
We invest a lot of time and effort in assessing how to manage for revenue growth with the utmost respect for the resources deployed and a focus on getting the best return on those resources, recognizing that in some areas secular trends are creating margin headwinds.
When looking at Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue, it's important also to remember that while YouTube advertising revenue is reflected in our Sites line, the associated content acquisition costs are included in other cost of revenues, not TAC.
Third, regarding CapEx, at Google the team has been able to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure, which has enabled us to support growing demand at a stable investment level.
And then I'll call out three key highlights from the quarter that are driving our advertising business today and into the future.
And after just one year, Google Photos is now helping over 200 million people every month organize and search their photos and memories.
Fourth, platforms; a key focus is building great computing platforms like Chrome, Android, and our new virtual reality platform, Daydream, so that people can have wonderful experiences regardless of the device or stream they are using.
So let me turn to three key moments from the quarter for our advertising business, number one, our Google Performance Summit for direct response marketers.
This creates even greater opportunity for businesses to use Google Maps to help bring customers into their physical store locations.
Thanks to our strong intent signals, particularly on mobile, Google continues to offer great opportunities for direct response marketers to reach potential customers, whether they are visiting your website, calling your business, walking into your store, or downloading your app.
The ability to advertise against fast-rising videos on YouTube as well as a deal with the NBA to bring their inventory to Google Preferred.
Today's great innovations are being driven by investments in Mobile.
I want to thank all the Googlers around the world who help us create these opportunities every day and help bring them to life for our users and partners.
I'll let you do your own forecasting, but when comparing growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year.
How should we think about the roadmap ahead for both increased user engagement with your product in those key verticals as well as the ability for advertiser conversion to lead to more advertising budgets for the company over the medium to long term?
And then maybe one second question would be, with the buyback authorization having been completed this quarter, Ruth, I would love to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about the balance sheet as an asset and how shareholders should think about the ability for shareholder returns over the medium and long term.
So you spent a lot of time talking about how this is positively impacting Google as a whole and how you're building for the future, both tonight and at I/O a few months ago.
But are there tangible examples of either engagement or volume also increasing as you roll out machine learning in Search and in YouTube that you could share?
And then, I think Google recently introduced Smart Bidding in AdWords using machine learning.
So we definitely Ã¢ÂÂ a core part of improving the user experience for the next many years will be driven by machine learning.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
So for people who choose to opt in, over time we could make sure they see more relevant ads and fewer annoying ones, so effectively put them in better control of the experience they get, and so I think that helps the whole ecosystem work better.
And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird.
Why has that been so successful recently, and do you look at that as an incremental forward driver of YouTube revenue growth?
With respect to consumers, we continue to invest in innovative opportunities that create great experiences and improve their lives.
Can you help us all think about what the level of engagement is on YouTube right now, whether it's minutes or maybe growth in images?
",52.33,0.93538785
google,q3,2016,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Most notably, Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business as well as the enormous opportunity in this area.
Relative to last year, we have an expanded portfolio of hardware products, and therefore expect marketing costs to increase in the fourth quarter to support the line.
We unveiled a beautiful lineup of new hardware devices, including Google Home and the Pixel phone, which is getting great reviews.
We reached an important milestone in that journey this quarter with the launch of the Google Assistant, which allows you to type or talk with Google in a natural conversational way to help you get things done regardless of the device you're using.
Second, moving to our efforts to bring more content to more places, key to making information accessible is helping people find more great content across platforms like the web, YouTube, and Google Play.
We also think there's an opportunity for us to more deeply integrate software and hardware together to deliver great experiences that we hope will also contribute to future innovation and development of the ecosystem.
Last month at our Horizon event, we introduced a new business unit, Google Cloud, our unique and broad portfolio of products and services that let our customers operate easily in a digital world with the performance they demand.
Our investments in machine learning continue to be a very clear advantage for Google Cloud, and we are helping customers apply ML in very concrete ways.
Our mobile properties like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Google Play are where people turn when they are actively interested in something.
I think one of the big questions we get from investors all the time are where are the key areas you need to invest going forward in both capabilities, go-to-market, and how those might evolve over the next couple years.
And then, Ruth, the second question is just on Ã¢ÂÂ core operating margins for Google have declined a little bit versus the prior quarter trend of increasing.
Ross, on the first question, I would say overall when I look across Google and Alphabet, the number of areas where we have been able to build world-class products and achieve scale and success, we today have over seven products which serve 1 billion users each, so I think our track record speaks there.
I think one of the core things to your question is just how we're looking at it, and our view continues to be that given the breadth of opportunities and our commitment to long-term revenue growth, as we've talked about, quarter after quarter we do remain committed to investing in this growing set of opportunities.
So along those lines, both Google Home in Google Pixel are important new efforts for us, and I think we will thoughtfully evolve our go-to-market strategy as well.
And you already see with Google Pixel we have a deep partnership at Verizon with which we are going to market in the U.S. And so we are constantly thinking about how to do this well, and you will see new approaches as we go through it more.
And as we evolve the Google Assistant, I think voice is going to play a major role that way as well.
I think the only thing to point out is that in looking at growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year, so that to us is an important point.
And things like the Google Assistant are a manifestation of that, and you will see us continue to stay focused and innovate that way.
And what's important to note is that's not only good for Google products generally, but it's also valuable to our cloud offering for our enterprise customers.
So that's the way we think about Google Cloud.
We want to make sure that all these new capabilities for machine learning and AI are available through Google Cloud to all our partners.
But could you talk about machine learning in search and how much it's making a difference over the past few quarters and how much you still have to go, how important that is to revenues?
And then, Ruth, a couple questions, any thoughts on whether hardware sales could make a difference to margins going forward, and also on the stock-based comp, how Google thinks about that expense internally?
While you've been waiting for the call to start, you've been listening to Dua Lipa, a rising new pop star from London, whose most recent single on YouTube has found fans all over the world and cracked the top 40 in the U.S. ahead of her debut album release early next year.
Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance, total revenue was $22.5 billion, up 20% year over year and up 4% sequentially.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $4.2 billion, up 29% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.
GAAP operating expenses were $8 billion in the quarter, up 15% year over year.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.5 billion, up 13% year over year.
On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.8 billion, up 22% versus last year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $7.6 billion, up 24% versus last year.
Stock-based compensation [SBC] totaled $1.9 billion, up 30% year over year and up 24% sequentially, primarily reflecting the step-up from our annual equity refresh for employees at the start of Q3.
Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud.
Total traffic acquisition costs [TAC] were $4.2 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 17% year over year and up 5% sequentially.
Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 28% year over year.
Turning to Other Bets, as we said previously, we think it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon because, as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary reasons.
Within Google, this relentless focus has led to innovations across our advertising platforms that have driven continued strong growth on a very large base, while at the same time we're building new businesses to serve as sources of future revenue growth.
Before moving on from expenses, one reminder regarding the fourth quarter; as discussed in prior years, our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season.
Third regarding CapEx, at Google the team continues to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure.
Today I want to walk through our progress across Google's key focus areas and the success of our growing advertising business.
Third, powerful computing platforms and hardware; we have long been committed to building powerful computing platforms like Android, Chrome, and now Daydream in VR, so that people can have great experiences regardless of their device.
We announced an enhanced media conference experience in Google Hangouts with an updated user interface, instant screen sharing, support for 50 participants, and a seamless integration into Calendar.
For instance, hotel chain La Quinta now sees a third of their website traffic coming from mobile, and they use our hotel ads to help them reach travelers right when they are looking for hotel stays.
They have found conversion rates to be twice as high with hotel ads compared to regular mobile traffic, which is helping them capitalize on those prime time moments when travelers are on their phones and ready to book.
We also recently announced expanded capabilities to show marketers how TV and YouTube campaigns increase Google and YouTube searches for their brand.
We introduced even more measurement solutions at this year's Advertising Week in New York, helping marketers close the loop with newer tools like location extensions and store visits measurements for the Google Display Network.
I'm really pleased with how our business teams are working closer than ever with their advertising partners, agencies, marketers, and publishers.
Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. So do you think this structure is ideal for entire companies, or is it just new products and new technologies that you see as the vision here for Alphabet long term?
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Google over the years has put out different hardware products.
And the thing which helps us deliver a great local search experience is Maps.
And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities.
In terms of your second question around expanded text ads, I would say again it's early.
So as you think about what your product portfolio might look like over the next five years or even the next decade, does the Pixel phone market change in direction for Google to become maybe more of an integrated software and hardware company?
And our final question comes from the line of Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.

google,q4,2016,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Alphabet Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call.
A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release.
Advertising revenue growth was driven by Mobile Search with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic.
Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $5.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses; specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers including depreciation and content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube as well as hardware.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year.
Non-GAAP operating income was $8.5 billion, up 24% versus last year.
Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as Cloud including the addition of employees from our Apigee acquisition.
Our effective tax rate was 22% for the fourth quarter reflecting the geographic mix of earnings and certain discrete items affecting our U.S. rate.
YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView including buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager.
Network revenue was $4.4 billion, up 7% year-on-year reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob offset by the traditional network businesses.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.9 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.
Starting with our first quarter results for 2017, we will no longer regularly exclude stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP results.
Noncash stock-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits.
This quarter was about the business firing on all cylinders and terrific progress across Google's newer areas of investment.
We routinely hear from customers that we have now moved well beyond table stakes, and we have truly differentiated offerings in four key areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy, tools for application development, and the ability to create connected business platforms, leveraging our recent acquisition of Apigee.
Our product advancements across all of GCP, in addition to our increased focus on how we work with the enterprise customers, have enabled us to accelerate growth with new Fortune 2000 customers while also inspiring our current customers to substantially expand their use of GCP.
Our increased success with enterprise customers relates to the unparalleled security and data protection we can provide by offering an entirely cloud-based solution that enables an extremely strong level of production.
This will work alongside our Firebase platform to help developers build better apps and grow their businesses.
Play had a great quarter with continued growth in our top markets, as well as in emerging markets where user spend grew by more than 70% year-over-year in countries like India, Mexico, Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
Second, we saw this season that measurement really matters, and advertisers want reliable ways of understanding where their sales and traffic are coming from and how their campaigns are working.
We saw increased use of our popular store visits technology over the holiday shopping season, helping businesses understand how online ads bring customers into their physical stores.
In less than two years, store visits have helped advertisers measure over 3 billion store visits globally.
Air France used YouTube's TrueView video ads in order to reach valuable business travelers and new customers around the world.
Would it be possible to get any sort of metrics around YouTube Red and how the subscription business has been progressing, realizing you're not going to be providing that every quarter but that you do occasionally give us some sort of benchmarks in the market?
I'd be curious to hear about how you think philosophically about partnering with more premium content players to maybe drive even higher engagement and an even better YouTube experience.
But I do think as part of these changes, advertisers can get more detailed insights from their YouTube campaigns across devices so they can better understand the impact of their marketing campaigns.
I wonder what's happening seasonally to that revenue line that drives fourth quarter up so much.
Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Wondering, Sundar, if you can just give us a sense on the Pixel phone hardware opportunity to kind of build direct mobile distribution and capture hardware margin, and how you think about that versus the potential disruption that having your own handset at a bigger scale could cause in the Android ecosystem?

Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Other revenue for Google was $3.4 billion, up 62% year-over-year with strong performance from each of hardware, Play and Cloud.
In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis, reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and Cloud businesses.
We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube.
We're investing in our Cloud and hardware businesses as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years.
Second, I want to talk about three of our biggest bets, YouTube, Cloud and hardware, where we are making great progress.
We had more than 350 launches powered by machine learning across areas like search, maps, messaging and Google Play.
And last quarter, the team announced new alliances including Intel, Improbable, Slack, Pivotal and Red Hat. We look forward to showcasing customers, partners and all of Google Cloud at our next annual Next user conference in March.
We are committed to this for the long-term as a great way to bring a beautiful seamless Google experience to people.
We will also continue working closely with our ecosystem partners to create the best experiences for our users.
Building powerful open platforms has always been core to Google and our platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream are creating more innovation, more choice for users and more opportunities for partners.
CES is just a start and there's a lot more coming from our great partners across these platforms in 2017, and we'll continue working hand-in-hand with them to provide the best experiences for our users.
Our mobile properties like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Google Play are where people turn when they are actively engaged.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions.
The momentum when we look at the numbers internally and as well as the traction we see in competitive situations, I definitely think we are going to have a great year and hopefully in the next conference coming up, Diane and team will share a lot more details.
Now that you have this breadth of device ecosystem out there into the marketplace, wanted to know if we get a little bit more color around what your learnings are about the adoption of the device ecosystem, how you're thinking about the go-to-market strategy over the medium to long-term and how we might see sort of an evolution across operating systems?
We expect to be there for users across a device ecosystem, and we're also building things like Google Play to work across all of this so that users can have one coherent experience.
I think we see great momentum both across our partner ecosystem, as well as pushing the cutting edge of the experience which is what we strive to do with our own hardware devices.
And the challenge I'll throw to you is, it looks to me like Google devices are being outsold ten-to-one or something like that in most Ã¢ÂÂ in a lot of homes, and it's immaterial now, but it could see in five years that there's is a new Voice Search interaction interface and it's not Google in the home.
So we are thinking about it across phones, homes, TVs, cars, and trying to drive that ecosystem that way, and we want Google to be there for users when they need it.
When I look at what it would take to Voice Search well, our years of progress we have done in areas like natural language processing comes into play, and I think there's a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users.
And then just to follow up on Mark's question on Voice Search, I understand, Sundar, it's early, but how do you think about the challenges and opportunities from a monetization perspective in Voice?
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. So on the first question in terms of YouTube, Sundar elaborated on my opening comments.
And really the point I was trying to stress consistent with Sundar's comments is, we've got the non-ads momentum here on the YouTube side, and we're also seeing tremendous momentum with cloud, which we're excited about, and the hardware and investing behind those.
And, Doug, I mean, just like Mark's question on Voice Search, I would encourage you to think about it as from a user standpoint, they are looking for information, looking to get things done.
So they may ask a question on voice, later when they pick up their phone, they want continuity, so we think of this as an end-to-end thing.
Look, I mean, I think Ã¢ÂÂ I would think about it as, we are investing a lot in developing this premium experience in a way of YouTube Brand, YouTube Music, and we do offer it across Google Play Music as well.
On your first question, look, I mean, we think of YouTube again as an ecosystem.
And when you're looking at the quarter-over-quarter, we are continuing to see things like the impact of policy changes and timing of product launches.
In terms of Google Assistant on the Pixel along with how search works, I think definitely it gives us a way to iterate and move faster and make sure it's working better for users.

As a reminder, I will review our results on a GAAP basis, which includes stock-based compensation for operating income, net income, and earnings per share.
Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions.
APAC revenues were $3.6 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 26% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strength of the Australian dollar and yen.
Other Americas revenues, which include results from Canada and Latin America, were up 34% versus last year to $1.3 billion.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.2 billion, up 34% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses Ã¢ÂÂ specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, as well as hardware-related costs reflecting the continued strong performance of our new Made by Google product line.
YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising.
Results benefited from a slower rate of decline in the traditional Network business than in prior periods, although it continues to be negatively affected by both the ongoing shift by advertisers to programmatic and our ongoing policy efforts.
Specifically, Play benefited from both broad-based app strength but also from all the work we have done in areas such as direct carrier billing, which helps more people globally access and buy their favorite apps and games on Google Play.
Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.6 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 22% year over year.
Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year over year as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate, driven by the shift to mobile, which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, which carries lower TAC.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.
As we discussed in prior calls, even though mobile revenue growth requires an increasing investment in the mobile ecosystem in the form of higher TAC, our strength in mobile search is adding meaningfully to profit dollars.
We'll host our annual developer conference, Google I/O; our advertising event, Google Marketing Next; and our YouTube upfront, Brandcast.
First, how our continued investments in machine learning are fueling innovation across Google, and particularly how it's helping drive our core mission of providing access to information for everyone.
YouTube continues to be the most popular destination for online video globally, and we are focused on building awesome experiences.
This quarter we announced YouTube TV, which offers live TV from major broadcast and cable networks, a cloud-based DVR without storage limits, and streaming on all of your devices.
That's across AdSense, YouTube, and Google Play, and it doesn't even include device sales by many hardware partners who build on Android.
And thanks to partnerships with major brands like TAG and Fossil, there'll be more than 20 different Android Wear watches available this year, doubling the number from last year.
Our virtual reality platform Daydream, which debuted almost a year ago, continues to gain traction with more devices and more great content, like VR video.
We have increased our investment in machine learning in our advertising business, with efforts like Smart Bidding, where our systems predict the performance of an ad and adjust advertisers' bids in real time to maximize their results.
Brands like Williams-Sonoma have seen a 70% increase in mobile sales year over year, with Google mobile shopping ads playing a big part.
Thanks to our app install advertising products, developers have already driven more than 5 billion app downloads.
It incorporates machine learning to improve campaigns and drive great results for advertisers.
We recently announced new innovations at the Game Developers Conference, including an interactive playable ad format in Universal App Campaigns that lets users play a lightweight version of your game right in the ad.
Brands love the reach and engagement that they get across YouTube, along with the effectiveness of formats like TrueView skippable ads and our new bumper ads, which are snackable six-second videos that drive incremental reach and frequency.
And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities.
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
And just how does the management team think about balancing profitability versus driving market share and long-term growth?
So, for example, when we recently invested in original shows, we find that like over half the time people spend watching originals is on their mobile phones.
YouTube, Google Earth VR, Tilt Brush Ã¢ÂÂ these are all great examples.
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Growth in advertising revenues was again driven by mobile search, with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $9.8 billion, up 28% year on year.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count growth was in Cloud, consistent with the priority we place on this business.
The biggest contributor to growth again this quarter was mobile search, reflecting the secular shift to mobile due to the greater utility of smartphones for users and advertisers, but obviously also benefiting from our focus on continuously enhancing features and functionality.
Last quarter we talked about our bigger investment areas, and you can see the strong momentum here, reflecting contributions from each of Play, hardware, and Cloud.
Google Cloud continues to drive sizable growth, with Google Cloud Platform remaining one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet.
First, we've benefited from our team's innovations that continually enhance our advertising business, as evidenced by the ongoing growth of Sites revenues.
Second, the strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams, including those from Cloud, hardware, and YouTube subscription offerings.
We also continue to announce new integration partners for the Google Assistant, so you can now ask it to do things like dim the living room lights.
Our Google Cloud Next conference in March was a great opportunity to highlight core areas of differentiation for GCP, like new security products and the recognition that we had the highest cloud availability in 2016, according to CloudHarmony.
Sales continues to be strong, and we are actively working to bring these great devices to more people around the world.
Our platforms have had great success over the years, creating incredible user experiences, as well as real opportunities and economic success for partners, creators, and developers around the globe.
Our great properties, like Search, Maps, YouTube, and Google Play, are the prime time for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions.
Next was Ã¢ÂÂ having done Google I/O many, many times, I was surprised to see the scale and growth of Next from even last year to this year.
So we find that when we drive the Assistant experience well, it works overall in helping people engage with Google at a broader level.
So those are beginning to get good feedback from users, and I think that gives us an opportunity to add value there over time as well.
I think there's a lot more work there, but the rate at which we are seeing advertisers Ã¢ÂÂ small, medium businesses Ã¢ÂÂ on our platform has been growing very, very strongly as well.
And then you talked about the real-time local-inventory integration, but, Sundar, I'd be curious if you could talk about any opportunities or areas of innovation in the retail search space that you see to really continue to improve users' retail-search experience.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc. I think obviously when we see what users are looking for in mobile, how shopping is evolving, it's an area we're continuously working on.
And so as we start doing that, and I think as we get a better understanding of their inventory and the data, how we can translate all of that into our core experience is a bit of the work ahead.
Shorter term, I think it's a space we continue to invest in.
And so I think to me that shows the long-term investments you make in these relationships, et cetera, plays well at times like these.
Sundar, ahead of this advertising conference I was thinking about Search innovation.
And that's the way we look at it, is we have tremendous opportunity continuing in mobile search and in YouTube across the business there.
And we're excited about the growth opportunities, not just within Google but across Alphabet with all that we're doing in Other Bets.
And then secondly, I wonder, with that focus on brand safety you hear now from agencies and the bigger marketers, what's going to be the long-term impact, do you think, to YouTube programmatic from a more focused view on finding the right places to advertise?
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. So on Sites TAC, as we've often discussed, and as you said in your question, there are a number of factors that affect Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue, and the primary driver has been the strong growth in mobile and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to TAC.
And on YouTube, when I look at it from a content creator standpoint, I think there are a lot of factors which are working well.
And so I think if you go and create these experiences in a way that works at scale for users, the monetization will follow.

google,q2,2017,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Our revenues of $26 billion in the second quarter demonstrate the ongoing momentum in our businesses with broad-based strength globally.
Let me wrap up, almost two years after the creation of Alphabet, we see the benefits of our focus within Google and Other Bets and are pleased with the opportunities we have for sustained revenue and earnings growth.
Our revenue growth and Alphabet structure give us both the opportunity and confidence to invest in our businesses for the long-term.
It's a good question, when I think about, we have, we are very focused over the long-term to making sure the Assistant can actually help people get things done in the real world.
And so over time we are laser focused on making sure we can deliver against those experiences, and I think local and their particular strength over time both in terms of, the expertise we have built in local as well as our investment in Maps is hopefully paying off.
And then on the OpEx side, the second quarter reflects a number of factors, first I think really to your question on an overtime point, you can see the impact of the timing shift in the equity refresh which we discussed previously.
But as I said in my opening comments, we're increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential, we are scaling it back in others, we're focused on organizational effectiveness to make the most of all of our resources and all of that really underpins the goal to sustain both revenue and earnings growth over the longer term.
Overall, when we think about our infrastructure obviously we are serving Cloud as well as our internal products which are seeing tremendous growth as well.
In terms of go-to-market, I shared an update on last, on that last quarter not sure there is much more interesting to add, we are continuing to do it well, we are scaling up and all the teams and the structure Diana has put in place is beginning to work well.
And then Sundar, another one more interesting innovations, that was, that kind of came out of Google IO was Visual Search, and can you just talk about, maybe a little bit roadmap for that or to the extent that which, how long it will take us actually see that broadly in the market, and what you think the appetite or how do you think that will change the way people search for products in the future they build need to also search visually through your phone?
But the increase in Sites TAC year-over-year, I think what I would stress is it really provides another lens on just how strong our mobile business is.
But I think at the, main point of your question here is we do continue to expect Sites TAC to increase, but our focus remains on growing profit dollars and I go back to my comment which is really pleased with the strength of our mobile business, which is benefiting profit dollars even as the TAC percentage increases.
First, I'm wondering if you could comment at all on the cloud business profitability, medium or long-term, how you are thinking about that.
We are clearly excited about the opportunity we have here and it does continue to drive sizable revenue growth as I said in my opening comments as did Sundar and we are seeing momentum in the business.
I think the comment that Sundar made about the number of new deals over 500,000 increasing 3x year-on-year gives you an indication of the momentum in the business.
It's obviously not a financial forecast but it does display the traction we are having with cloud in the market and GCP remains one of the fastest growing businesses across Alphabet, G-suite continues to have strong growth.
We do believe that from -- the many years of investment we have already made and things like technical infrastructure and security which operate with tremendous efficiency that provides us with a benefit, but near term we are investing meaningfully in sales and engineering service support -- continuing to expand out regions to make sure that we are delivering the best experience for our enterprise customers and that's what we are really focused on.
And then, Ruth, in your prepared remarks you mentioned tremendous growth in mobile search in the quarter, I think that's a more emphatic statement in recent quarters, hoping that maybe you could provide more color on some of the areas where you are seeing the change and quite trajectory coming from within mobile search?
And then on mobile search, I think what you are hearing is, we are really pleased with the ongoing efforts there and as I just said there was not one change that really drove this, what extraordinary about the team is, with the focus on users and advertisers, what is it that is most useful Sundar has spoke about some of them with local, but it's really again -- it's a lot of small incremental efforts that in the aggregate continue to enable us to benefit from whatÃ¢ÂÂs a really nice underlying secular trend here.
So, yes, there is broad based strength across geographies and I think -- I'm not calling out one particular area because the -- what you are seeing here is the secular trend I have used that term a couple of times now.
It's obviously a mix of businesses including some of our bigger investment areas, most notably cloud and hardware and as I said at the outset Play continues to perform really well.
And in terms of products like Google Assistant and Voice, I think we will make sure for users it doesn't matter and they work across every platform they use including our platforms as well as other people's platform.
And maybe on YouTube I would say, YouTube is one of those products which is scaling really well globally just like search did and we are seeing real strong growth on mobile.
So, if I look at YouTube on mobile on emerging markets on larger screens, they all look like newer opportunities and so I think there is a lot more growth ahead.
Advertising revenues benefitted from the strong performance insights, which was led in particular by tremendous results in mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube.
Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter after which we will take questions.
Other America's revenues which include results from Canada and Latin America were $1.4 billion up 31% versus last year in both reported and fixed FX terms.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.3 billion up 27% year-over-year primarily driven by Google related expenses.
Hardware continues to grow at a healthy pace year-on-year with the extension of our product line geographically, particularly Google Home and Wi-Fi, the dollar impacted growth was more muted than in prior quarters reflecting seasonality.
We continue to see increasing contributions from our growing non-ads revenue businesses, Play continues to be a strong contributor, in addition we have been making big Bets within Google focused on Cloud, hardware and subscription businesses in YouTube in order to better serve customers, while also building additional and differentiated revenue streams.
Our ability to rapidly deploy the best machine learning in all of our products enabled us this quarter to launch all sorts of new smart features, to help moderate comments, suggest smart replies in Gmail and improved translations.
We rolled out new machine learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos, which now has more than 500 million monthly users who backup 1.2 billion photos and videos every day.
Google Cloud Platform, GCP continues to experience impressive growth across products, sectors and geographies and increasingly with large enterprise customers in regulated sectors.
An incredible 82 billion apps were downloaded from Google Play in the last year alone.
Here to machine learning is critical to helping advertisers and app developers analyze data in real time to reach consumers with more useful ads and measure campaign effectiveness.
We also launched new ad formats and bidding features in Universal App Campaigns to help developers grow their user base across Google Play, Search, YouTube, Gmail and the Display Network.
At Google IO in 2016, we announced we had driven 2 billion app installs, today that number is more than 5 billion that's amazing growth.
Every month Google helps drive 100 billion visits to business websites and creates more than 3 billion direct connections between businesses and their customers.
I'm looking forward to seeing first time how technology and Google's products can make a real difference in people's lives.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS Securities.
Great, thanks for taking my question.
First one for Ruth, I was just hoping you could help us understand at least qualitatively how core margins for the advertising business are trending within the Google segment?
So starting with your margin question like as we've often said, we're focused on revenue and operating income dollar growth and not on operating margins.
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities.
One for Sundar, at Marketing Next your team unveiled new ways that Google is leveraging consumer intense signals across your billion user plus platforms.
Thanks for taking my questions today.
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch.

Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.
APAC revenues were $4.2 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 31% in fixed FX terms.
The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.
A couple of updates; Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with a number of notable launches including the Nest Thermostat E, which is offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat.
In that regard, the most important point is that we are data driven with an extraordinary team of engineers, product managers and designers, who constantly challenge assumptions and run thousands of experiments annually to enhance user and advertiser experiences.
This approach enables us to find new opportunities given that the way consumers seek information continues to evolve.
Pressure in our total cost of revenues reflects our product mix shift with a number of our higher growth businesses also carrying higher cost of revenues.
The other cost of revenues associated with our non-advertising businesses is also affected by product mix.
The more modest OpEx growth in Q3 reflects both the timing of stock-based compensation and the timing of sales and marketing spend, with the reality that not all investments fall neatly into a single calendar quarter.
It's been particularly exciting to see our early bet on artificial intelligence pay off and go from a research project to something that can solve new problems for a billion people a day.
We introduced Assistant last year and it continues to get better every day, helping people get things done in the real world.
That billion plus people using Google Maps now get thoughtfully contextual information like how to find parking where they are going.
I'm really pleased with the way our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome, have continued to grow, enabling great experiences for people all over the world and powering devices for more than 1,000 brands worldwide.
And we are working with publishers to build a frictionless payment solutions for subscriptions that can help them grow revenues and find new readers.
To wrap up my overview, I'm thrilled with how Google is solving big problems and making products that billions of people use every day.
This quarter, we launched a new feature that lets viewers share videos directly in the app.
Customers tell us they are switching to Google Cloud Platform because of our prowess in data analytics and machine learning, our commitment to being an open platform with tools like Kubernetes, which runs in both cloud and hybrid environments and our leadership in security.
Also this quarter, we signed a deal with HTC in Taiwan that will help accelerate our hardware business by bringing on a team of talented engineers.
And Google continues to be the platform of choice to help small business owners get online and grow their business.
During the quarter, more than 1 million small businesses used it to build up websites, helping many of them get online for the first time.
We also introduced local post, which allows small business owners to easily post their latest updates like upcoming events, special offers and new arrivals, right on Google Search in Maps.
Our commitment to both large and small advertisers shows how we build products that all businesses can succeed in.
Just two weeks ago, I was in Pittsburgh launching our new Grow with Google initiative, which provides digital skills to millions of people and economic opportunity to countless businesses.
But with shopping, especially as we move on to making shopping more seamless across mobile and newer computing categories like Google Home, I think there's tremendous interest here.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Is there something different that Alphabet/Google has done in Asia to accelerate that growth?
And also launched region-specific products like Google Tez in India.
Hey, I like to Ã¢ÂÂ maybe discuss a couple of your growth businesses.
You've made large and exciting investment in growth opportunities across Google and Other Bets.
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $19.7 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Earlier this month, for example, we launched our expanded line of hardware products, bringing the best AI software and hardware together and building on the first generation of Made by Google products we introduced last year.
Second, with respect to profitability, we continue to remain focused on long-term dollar growth versus margins.
In our advertising businesses, TAC continues to increase as our highest growth areas, mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
In the fourth quarter in particular, the impact of our growing hardware line will be more accentuated given the early stage of this business and holiday seasonality.
Third, as to CapEx, we continue to invest to support business momentum, including increased compute power from machine learning, which is an asset across Alphabet as well as to support cloud, search and YouTube growth.
I've been really proud of the progress this quarter, launching popular new products and continuing to grow our business in new areas.
Three of the key areas we are focused on are; strengthening the existing community, continuing to drive growth and expanding our subscriptions business.
To support our growing global customer base, we introduced two new regions in the quarter in SÃÂ£o Paulo and Frankfurt and continue to grow our go-to-market team.
This year, we are focused on bringing together the best AI software and hardware to give people a great user experience.
We have a host of really exciting opportunities and ensuring that we're investing to support long-term growth remains number one.
Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc. The Asia question, largely, I think we've been laying a foundation for a very, very long time.
I think the most important point is that what you're seeing is we have a very healthy mobile business, search business and it is growing substantially and our focus remains on long-term revenue and profit dollar growth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. So it felt like a number of calls talked about the fact that there was no one item that was driving the momentum we saw in our sites revenue, and that was the point of giving you a bit more color here.
We are really pleased with the momentum in the business, excited about the opportunities we have given the ongoing strong underlying secular trend, but wanted to give you more color on what do we mean by a culture of innovation, and that's really why I tried to get into a bit more about the rigor of the process.
And I guess, in particular, how do you think about maintaining Google fleet as the way we search changes, and as we see increasing adoption of these voice-enabled digital assistance in the home?
So as the mobile search market matures, particularly in the Western markets, the question is, why does Google feel like it needs to pay any TAC to partners at all?
So we are driving it forward in a way in which we know it's going to give strong both revenue and earnings growth.
Sundar, how do you think about the strategic importance to drive Chrome and Google Assistant app installs and user growth on non-Android mobile platforms?
A lot of the things that we're doing are multi-year investments, and that's why we stress repeatedly that we're looking at what are the long-term needs and opportunities that we could be addressing, if we're doing that well, we're delivering long-term revenue and earnings growth.
Yeah, main thing I would say is the consumer feedback, I think there's always been this promise on being able to, just like today on Google Search when you want something, we make it so easy for you to find it.
And we are gathering a lot of feedback, bringing it to more markets, and I'm going to work hard at making the product better.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. So in terms of TAC, as I indicated, we've got a couple of things going on.
On the second thing, look, I think based on every metric we see users' information needs are only going up.
So Sundar, can you talk about how Google is positioning in the emerging markets over the longer term can be different versus what we are used to seeing here in the States.
So I think we see a way to look at these markets with a lot more thought and address them for the opportunity that they have, not just apply our global products there.

google,q4,2017,"The ongoing very strong performance in sites revenue in particular reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth with mobile search again leading the way.
APAC revenues were $4.7 billion, up 30% versus last year and up 32% in fixed FX terms, reflecting weakening of the Japanese yen.
Other Americas revenues were $1.9 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 30% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strengthening of the Canadian dollar.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically, costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, hardware-related costs for our expanded Made by Google family of products and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.
IÃ¢ÂÂll cover results for the full-year 2017 because it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon, as discussed on prior calls.
With the closing of our deal with HTC earlier this week for example, weÃ¢ÂÂve added 2,000 employees to support our hardware business.
The most sizable catalyst for added investment in compute power include the expanding application of machine learning efforts across Alphabet as well as additional requirements for GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs Cloud, Search and YouTube businesses.
A lot has changed but our mission organizing the worldÃ¢ÂÂs information and making it universally accessible and useful remains the best guide for the next 10 years.
Google Cloud, which includes Google Cloud Platform and G Suite, has reached meaningful scale, and IÃ¢ÂÂm excited to share today that itÃ¢ÂÂs already $1 billion per quarter business.
Every month more than 1.5 billion people come to YouTube to watch their favorite content on channels ranging from the Ellen Show which has more than 22 million subscribers to the NBA with over 8 million subscribers to SciShow, a really popular educational channel with more than 4.5 million subscribers.
There was a lot of excitement around the Google Assistant at CES from partners and consumers where we brought the Assistant to new surfaces like smart displays from brands like JBL and Lenovo as well as Android Auto which is now available in more than 400 car models from brands like GM, Hyundai and Volvo.
As shoppers turned to their mobile phones this holiday shopping season, Google was central to helping them discover new brands, compare products and find the best deals.
We are focused on making sure YouTube is a great place for users and advertisers while helping creators earn money from popular content.
This includes news publishers, app developers and YouTube creators, who we share revenue with.
Over the last four years, our partners have earned over $100 billion; thatÃ¢ÂÂs incredible and we are working on new ways to drive even more value to our partners.
We will also be building or opening five big new data centers in the U.S. And with digital skills and high demand by employers, our Grow with Google initiative will have job seekers and small businesses gain education and skills to help them succeed.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.
Some big news earlier this week just in terms of Waymo with FCA talking about delivering thousands of minivans to Waymo later in the year.
Third is CapEx. And when we considered all of that thatÃ¢ÂÂs led us to extend -- have the Board extend share repurchase program which we announced a couple of years ago.
And we work hard to make sure we bring the best experience possible, which is why I said [ph] they were also Search and Assistant we partner with companies like Walmart for example to make it much easier to buy products and so on.
Any other information you can give us there on user growth or engagement trends would be great, anything on time spent, I mean particularly as YouTube becomes more mature and mobile video particularly in North America gets more competitive.
Maybe one area which for example highlights how well itÃ¢ÂÂs doing is if you think about YouTube on TV, people actually want watching YouTube on the big screen, our growth has been significant there.
We obviously want to make sure YouTube has a great experience for users, content creators and advertisers because it supports content creators.
As we move from just answers to helping users complete actions about time including transactions, the ability to complete the transaction is an important part of it and which is why making sure Google Pay in a unified way works as seamlessly as possible is a big part of our long-term strategy.
Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Our momentum reflects the relentless focus on users, advertisers and enterprise customers as well as the benefits of our commitment to long-term investing.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22.2 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
Both mobile and desktop search continue to grow and benefit from our approach to innovation with strong momentum as we identify additional opportunities to enhance the user and advertiser experience.
As weÃ¢ÂÂve consistently emphasized, alongside the continued momentum in our advertising business, we are focused on building a second wave of growth within Google over the medium and long-term which includes the rapidly growing revenue businesses in Google, cloud, hardware and YouTube.
With respect to cloud, weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing the benefits of a fully featured enterprise offering and an expanded go-to-market team, bringing our advantages in infrastructure, data analytics, security and machine learning to more customers.
Finally, as we look further into the future for our third wave of growth, we remain excited about the longer term potential for our Other Bets businesses.
While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue will slow after the first quarter of 2018.
As I discussed on last quarterÃ¢ÂÂs call, marketing spend in the fourth quarter is significantly elevated, in particular supporting hardware but also across cloud and YouTube.
For 2018, we remain excited about the investments we are making to drive the next phase of growth in our big bets in Google in cloud, hardware and YouTube, and our machine learning efforts which are powering innovation across our businesses.
We are excited about the significant opportunities weÃ¢ÂÂve identified in our businesses and continue to invest appropriately.
There is great momentum around the Google Assistant as we bring it to more people on more devices.
In addition to the significant work we are doing to product users and stop abuse on the platform, just a few weeks ago, we announced changes to advertising on YouTube, including stricter monetization criteria, new manual reviews for all videos in Google Preferred and simpler controls for marketers.
Sundar, coming out of CES and the success you had with Google Home and the Google Assistant during the holiday period based on the blog post you guys put out, can you identify some of the key investments in either partnerships or hardware or capabilities that youÃ¢ÂÂre targeting over the next one to two years to make sure the momentum around Assistant is sustained?
So, I think the framework is great, and long-term, our investments in AI will directly manifest its capabilities for users through the Google Assistant.
And as you know well, the TAC rate for each of sites network as a percentage of revenue lines, thatÃ¢ÂÂs continued to increase because theyÃ¢ÂÂre our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic and so carry higher TAC.
And then, the other thing to note, other cost of revenue does reflect the seasonality of hardware, having increased both the number of products and the Made by Google family as well as continuing to expand geographically in western Europe and APAC, you can see that reflected here.
And how do we think about these impacting the rate of change in TAC, since you are talking about the pace of growth in TAC as we look out, call it in year two if these are multiyear deals?
I mean, given the ongoing momentum in our mobile search business, this does continue to be relevant, as you look forward, given mobile carryÃ¢ÂÂs higher TAC.
So, we continue to invest in machines to support growth we see across Google but in particular supporting Cloud, Search, YouTube and all that we are doing in machine learning.
The first one, Ruth, you called out desktop search, I think the second straight quarter as being relatively strong.
And then, Ruth, just a question on the growth in marketing spend in the fourth quarter.
Our growth last year was very strong there, which is why we supported it with investments like YouTube Go. And we are seeing it now grow well-beyond mobile, especially in the leaving room.
And as both, Sundar and IÃ¢ÂÂve said, these are important Google growth areas for us and we are investing to support growth in the business.
And then, Ruth, in the prepared remarks, there was a lot of comments on investment in your medium-term business growth drivers, offices, data centers and other areas.
And that we just continue to be focused on doing the right things to support growth of the business.
On the video gaming side, I think, look, we are -- maybe today have a lot of momentum in these areas, both with YouTube as a platform, Google play.

google,q1,2018,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
The sustained outstanding performance in sites revenues, in particular, reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth, with mobile search again leading the way.
Ongoing substantial growth in other revenues, namely cloud, hardware and Play, continues to highlight the growing contribution of our non-ads opportunities.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.5 billion, up 37% year-on-year.
The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects advertising investments in cloud and hardware as well as the Assistant.
In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year, led again by mobile search complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.
As we previously announced, we made a change this quarter to impression-based monetization metrics for our network business given the ongoing growth of programmatic.
This year-on-year increase in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.
The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC.
The opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary, and we remain focused on investment to support long-term revenue and profit growth.
We're pleased with the continued momentum of our revenue growth again this quarter, reflecting strong underlying trends across our business, which are amplified by our relentless focus on innovation, not only in our newer businesses, like cloud and hardware, but in our sites business.
At 26% year-on-year revenue growth in our sites business, we continue to benefit from our investments to enhance the user and advertiser experience.
While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenues, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we continue to anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues, will slow beginning in this second quarter.
We appreciate the importance of prioritization and are keenly focused on the steps we can take to make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns.
These combined investments will expand our compute capacity to support our growth outlook across Google, including machine learning, the Assistant and cloud.
Today, I'll quickly talk about how machine learning is helping us advance that mission, then I'll highlight progress in our 3 big areas, cloud, YouTube and hardware, and share updates on our computing and advertising platforms.
So we keep coming back to when you create vehicles that drive themselves faithfully, we think there's a lot of potential uses and business opportunities, and that's what we're focused on.
But overall, we think we'll be able to do all that with the positive impact for users and publishers and the advertisers and so our business.
But I think more to your question with respect to technical infrastructure, that reflects investments in compute power to support growth that we see across Google, and the largest component is on machines.
So I think, really, to answer your question most directly, it reflects the demand that we're seeing, so I wouldn't want to suggest a one-off in terms of the investments we're making in technical infrastructure.
On the first question of cloud, look, I mean, I think the main thing I would say is the fundamental drivers of adoption of Google Cloud based on what we hear back from customers is our advantage in data analytics and machine learning.
And so these changes had a positive impact on the year-on-year growth in CPMs. And then the trend and impressions in CPMs can clearly be volatile from quarter-to-quarter as we're optimizing for the user publisher and advertiser, but it really goes to the efforts that we make.
As we've talked about on many, many calls, we have been and remain focused on supporting long-term revenue and profit growth, and we think the opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary.
And so we're continuing to invest to enhance the user and advertiser experience, and thereby, extend the growth in our ads business.
As I noted in our opening comments, the investments we're making there really provide the compute capacity to support our growth outlook, and that's supporting the opportunities that come out of machine learning and the Assistant.
And so we're investing to support the long-term growth opportunity there.
As we highlighted in our earnings press release, our results this quarter were affected by a new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments.
The key drivers were, first, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which was affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses primarily from G&A; second, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and finally, hardware related costs.
Operating expenses were $10.7 billion, up 27% year-over-year, with the biggest increase in R&D expenses reflecting our continued investment in technical talent.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were the additions from HTC followed by hiring and cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Other income and expense was $3.5 billion, which includes $3 billion of primarily unrealized gains in equity security investments recognized under the new accounting standard.
As indicated in the table in our earnings press release, these results reflect an increase in net income of $2.4 billion and $3.40 in earnings per diluted share due to the impact from the gains in equity security investments we've already discussed.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $7.7 billion, reflecting investments in facilities, production equipment and data center construction.
Our commitment to growth is evident in the trend in CapEx investment, almost equally split this quarter between compute capacity and facilities.
In many respects, these investments underscore my opening comment about both our confidence and clarity about future opportunities with our focus on proprietary solutions that enable us to deliver the secure, reliable, high-performing compute infrastructure to support new and emerging products and services for our users, advertisers and enterprise customers.
Over the years, we have worked closely with the news industry to address key challenges through projects like Accelerated Mobile Pages.
As part of this effort, we announced more than a dozen new products, including Subscribe with Google developed in close collaboration with publishers, which lets you use your Google account to buy a subscription on participating news sites.
All told, the Google Assistant can now help you with over 1 million actions, including new things like reminding you to buy bread when you get to the store or sending money to friends or if you want to get a ride share home.
This app reduces the amount of data needed to display search results by 40%, and we continue to invest in ways to give people granular and easy controls over their information across all our products.
Some examples of new technologies announced in the quarter include Cloud AutoML, which makes it easier for companies without machine learning expertise to build complex neural nets and more than 20 new security products.
This quarter, Dua Lipa's video for New Rules became the 100th video on YouTube to reach 1 billion views.
Even as we invest in new experiences, we stay very focused on making sure that YouTube remains a safe platform with great content.
This uses machine learning to analyze ad placements on a publisher's page and show ads when they are likely to perform well while providing a good user experience.
If you could talk a little bit about just the latest timing for the commercial launch in Phoenix and how quickly you'd look to expand to other markets, and then just how you're thinking about the technology and whether you'll license it to others going forward or keep it more proprietary for Waymo services?
And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley.
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird.
Mobile web is still a big part of how users consume content, especially around news, and so us investing there clearly makes a difference.
And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of CrÃÂ©dit Suisse.
So Sundar, I think one of the themes that you as a management team has talked about has been to, I guess, democratize advertising with AI to help SMBs who may have found advertising across Google's ad products to be perhaps overwhelming.
",42.65,0.8029101
google,q2,2018,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
We delivered another quarter with strong operating performance, reflecting our focus on building great experiences for users, advertisers and enterprise customers around the world.
Sites revenues continued to exhibit strong year-on-year momentum, benefiting from innovation and secular growth with mobile search again leading the way.
Our outline for todayÃ¢ÂÂs call is IÃ¢ÂÂll begin with results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes.
Second, as discussed last quarter, our results are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses.
G&A expense trends in the second quarter were affected by a number of factors, in particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily the other cost of revenues.
Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 21% year-over-year.
As discussed previously, we continue to identify new opportunities through innovation, including the benefits of applying machine learning to create more useful experiences for users and advertisers.
For our Other Bets, we remain focused on making progress on a number of commercial opportunities across the business, while continuing to manage investment against achievement of key milestones.
WeÃ¢ÂÂre also investing in new businesses that are growing at a rapid pace and have sizable compute needs, most notably Cloud.
And keeping with our approach across Alphabet to invest thoughtfully for long-term value creation, we remain focused on both performance and cost effectiveness.
10 years ago, we launched the first Android phone with a simple idea to build a mobile platform thatÃ¢ÂÂs free and open to everyone.
Continuing this momentum, at I/O, we unveiled a plethora of new features throughout the Android platform, like battery saving features in Android P, new Google Assistant capabilities on Wear OS, the new Android model to help developers optimize for a variety of devices and form factors, as well as tools to help users understand and control how they are spending time on their device.
While advertising on YouTube is an incredibly strong and growing source of income for creators, we are also investing in new ways for creators to generate revenue on the platform, including paid channel memberships, merchandise shelves on YouTube channels, and endorsement opportunities, through a company we acquired in 2016, FameBit. At Google Marketing Live, we introduced our newly rebranded advertising products, our core product Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform which provides analytics and ad serving for large marketers and agencies, and Google Ad Manager, our monetization engine for publishers.
We also announced a new ad format powered by machine learning, called Responsive Search Ads. It automates the manual process of building text ads and optimizes them in real time to show the best performing ad for each search query.
This quarter, we announced shopping and commerce partnerships with leading global retailers like Carrefour, designed to give people the power to shop wherever and however they want.
Financial institutions are increasingly turning to the cloud to modernize their systems, explore new business models and improve customer experiences.
Before I close, I want to give a quick shout out to the work that we are doing to build great specialized products for the next wave of people coming online for the first time in countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria, many of whom experience the web only through their mobile phone.
And to help spur AI innovation in Africa, we recently announced the new Google AI research center in Ghana with the goal of bringing together top machine learning researchers and engineers to explore AI research and applications in Africa and beyond.
I want to thank Googlers for their hard work which helps us create products that billions of people love and use every day.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.
What Google brings on table for those partners, what it might do for the advertising services business as we thing long-term?
Is there any you can give us of some of the key investment milestones or how we should be thinking about capital allocated to the Waymo business in the coming years?
We talked this past quarter about licensing the technology for personal use vehicles, and weÃ¢ÂÂre also focused on working with cities to help strengthen public transportation.
As I said, weÃ¢ÂÂre excited about the long-term opportunity but creation of a new market does take time.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve talked about that on many prior calls and are investing here for long-term value creation thoughtfully in order to be able to pursue the opportunities that we see ahead of us.
And local campaigns is something new which we announced at Google Marketing Live a couple of weeks ago.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs a valuable driver of our growth, not only enhancing experiences for users but the tools that we talked about for advertisers and for app developers, certainly helping them find the right audience, to be able to optimize campaigns at scale, to deliver more relevant and higher quality ads.
The Google Marketing Live, weÃ¢ÂÂve really highlighted what weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing there and the benefits, whether weÃ¢ÂÂre talking about responsive search ads or local campaigns, smart shopping campaigns, another great example is universal app campaigns.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which IÃ¢ÂÂll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.9 billion, up 34% year-on-year.
Looking ahead, our hardware business is seasonal, typically experiencing lower growth in the third quarter in anticipation of the launch of new products for the holiday season.
As weÃ¢ÂÂve discussed for the past couple of quarters, we expected the pace of year-on-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue would slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that clearly in our results of this quarter.
As frequently discussed, we do expect the sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, albeit at a more moderate pace relative to the year-on-year increases experienced over the past several quarters.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been investing meaningfully in search and ads consistent with the opportunities we see to benefit the user and advertiser experience.
The investment pace also reflects the importance of machine learning across all of our products including search and ads.
ItÃ¢ÂÂs been a busy few months at Google, and we showed a lot of what we are working on at events like Google Marketing Live, Brandcast, and of course our annual developer conference, Google I/O.
The common thread youÃ¢ÂÂll hear on todayÃ¢ÂÂs call is the benefit of machine learning and AI, and how itÃ¢ÂÂs improving our products and generating great results for our users and partners.
And with over 1 billion users, weÃ¢ÂÂre continuing to see tremendous growth in maps with especially strong growth in countries like Indonesia, India and Nigeria, each of which are growing over 50% year-on-year.
Our investments in our computing platforms, as well as in AI and design are also helping us generate great momentum in our made by Google hardware business across Pixel, Home, Nest, Chromecast and more.
So, weÃ¢ÂÂre taking the end-to-end user experience in mind, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs where all the investments we have done over many, many years I think will come into play as the product evolves.
So, in terms of your first question and kind of machine learning, and I think youÃ¢ÂÂre kind of getting at cycle.
YouÃ¢ÂÂre really seeing it in two places, and part of that is they called out is with respect to OpEx. WeÃ¢ÂÂre hiring and what youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing is the investments weÃ¢ÂÂre making across the board, itÃ¢ÂÂs ads, itÃ¢ÂÂs cloud, itÃ¢ÂÂs hardware, itÃ¢ÂÂs the Assistant, but this is also very much in machine learning and we are really proud of the team that we have and given the opportunity set that they are able to address.
And I think you were getting more broadly at CapEx. The way weÃ¢ÂÂre focused on CapEx, as I said last quarter as well, we view this as it lands into our outlook for growth and the required additional compute capacity.
And part is really to support growth that we are seeing in our search and ads business thatÃ¢ÂÂs really consistent with the momentum that weÃ¢ÂÂve commented on today and the exciting opportunities that we see to further enhance the user and advertiser experience.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve talked about this in the past, machine learning is more compute intensive, but it also opens up more services and products across Alphabet, and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what we are investing in to make sure that weÃ¢ÂÂve got the capacity with best-in-class compute capacity.
And then, for Ruth, on the theme of OpEx investment trends, if we isolate just the other revenue businesses, Cloud, Play and Hardware, all growth drivers, but clearly structurally different in terms of the competitive landscape and profitability.
And in terms of your question, on investment priorities, I think one of the most important points to underscore is that one of the biggest opportunities for investment, continues to be in our ads business where we are continuing to investment meaningfully, given the opportunity set that we see there.
Sundar commented on some of them, as did I, looking at opportunities to enhance the user experience, to continue to improve tools for advertisers, and both of which extend the growth there.
When we start with cloud, as Sundar commented, given the core capabilities that we are building upon, our technical infrastructure, security app, machine learning, analytical tools, our view is that weÃ¢ÂÂre addressing a rapidly growing market with the core pillars that are needed to win.
Our hardware business continues to deliver significant growth, particularly with the sales as a home family of products, and youÃ¢ÂÂve seen us invest there.
And we are continuing to invest in building a local experience that benefits merchants, users and advertisers.
Colin, on Google Assistant and Shopping Actions, there I do think itÃ¢ÂÂs been exciting to see the improvement there, but I still would like that experience theyÃ¢ÂÂve all a lot more before we play around with monetization.
So, in terms of sites revenue, I think, our view is ongoing strength reflects our focus on improving the user experience and enhancing tools for advertisers.
And IÃ¢ÂÂd add that a good way to think about it is, today, there is a lot of complexity you need to deal with to have advertiser, and increasingly we are using machine learning to do all the hard work and get them to focus on the business problem they are trying to solve.
On YouTube, we definitely are continuing to see great product momentum, itÃ¢ÂÂs the user adoption and interest and our metrics are very strong, continues to grow and the growth is global.

google,q3,2018,"Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.
Starting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter, our total revenues of $33.7 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $385 million or $305 million after the impact of our hedging program.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses.
The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation which continue to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.
As discussed in the previous two quarters, both operating income and OI&E are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities.
We get billions of questions from users every day and about 15% of those are queries we have never seen before.
It's a great example of how we bring together Google's strengths to help people through their day.
They include a new AI powered ranking approach that delivers more relevant results, a redesigned Google feed called Discover to help you stay informed on topics that matter to you and a new search experience for Google images.
We launched our first set of smart displays with Lenovo and JBL as well as our own Google Home Hub. Pixel users in the U.S. will be the first to try our new duplex technology which helps you complete real-world tasks over the phone like calling a restaurant to book a table and we introduced a new way to easily book ride services with your Google Assistant.
For example, our recent flood prediction efforts, which use AI to better predict when floods will occur had the potential to help millions of people get out of harm's way.
Every day people from all over the world turn to YouTube to learn something new from career skills to coding to cooking.
Just this week, we announced a $20 million investment to expand our YouTube Learning initiative which will help fund established and emerging educational careers.
YouTube's Ask business continues to provide great results for marketers and creators.
Advertisers love that we are bringing our machine learning strengths to offerings like responsive search ads and universal App Campaigns to create more effective ads.
In apps, we announced a partnership with Unity Technologies, which gives our advertisers access to one of the largest global networks of mobile gaming titles across 1.5 billion devices.
One of our big wins in the quarter was Fast Retailing, the Japanese retailer best known for its popular brand UNIQLO, which is migrating its employees globally to G Suite, while also pursuing AI solutions like on-demand forecasting on Google Cloud Platform.
Our cloud business is benefiting from our investments in technical infrastructure including a U.S.-Europe cable that will improve speeds for millions of people.
We're also building products to meet the specific needs of users in the region like Tez, a digital payments app for India, to help people easily pay their electrician or split it in a bill with just a few taps.
Just one year since it launched, over 30 million people in businesses across India now use the app every month and they've collectively made more than 1 billion transactions.
In Q3, more than 80% of Alphabet's total capital expenditures was within the U.S. Not only do these investments in datacenters, machines and offices allow us to provide great services to users, they have a strong positive impact on the communities around them, supporting thousands of jobs and countless local businesses.
I want to say a big thank you to all of Googlers around the world who help us deliver on that mission every day.
And then with respect to your comments on YouTube, we're starting to hear from advertisers that there is some blurring between brand and direct response ad budgets as they look at products maybe more across blended lines.
And I look at my personal use cases that are many times now sometimes instead of search, actually find something I want to do in YouTube, maybe thinking about going to a place.
Our ads leadership comes Ã¢ÂÂ Prabhakar who has taken over our ads product and engineering efforts, someone I worked with for many, many years, and most recently has led our G Suite business, but has done many roles before, is a deep computer scientist.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Sundar, can you help us better understand how the remedy in Europe will work in terms of licenses and TAC going forward?
So as you guys roll out more products like Lens and Gboard and some of these other utilities on top of your 1 billion-plus apps like search and YouTube, is there any way to parse out what the overall engagement looks like in markets like the U.S. and Western Europe when the phones are improving their functionality and can you keep adding these additional utilities?
But I'm wondering if you could share with us an update maybe on the partner momentum and direct sales momentum you're seeing in the market, how you've seen that change?
And also if you could highlight, if you've noticed if there's been noticeable changes in win rates over the last year as the product continues to mature.
As you look out two or three years, do you think any of these businesses could really make a financial positive difference on the bottom line for overall Google?
Our revenues in the third quarter continued to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, cloud and desktop search, resulting in consolidated revenues of $33.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency.
For today's call, I will begin with the results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes.
The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing head count primarily for cloud and ads followed by advertising investments in cloud, Chromebooks for the back-to-school season and the Google Assistant.
We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum in our advertising businesses as we apply our strength in machine learning to improve the experience for users and advertisers.
Looking ahead, we expect seasonal impacts to our other cost of sales from hardware sales which are typically higher in the fourth quarter of the year as well as from increased content acquisition costs for YouTube, which have also historically been higher in the fourth quarter.
We are continuing to invest in adding talent to our priority areas, particularly for technical roles in engineering and product management and to support our most sizable growth areas, in particular, cloud.
And finally, with respect to CapEx, you can see our continued investment as we build the infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see across our businesses.
Before I wrap up, I want to quickly call out our continued momentum in Asia as well as the investments that we are making in the U.S. As you can see from our results, revenue growth in APAC remains strong.
We have adapted many of our core products like search, Maps and YouTube to work well for the next generation of users coming online.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions.
Referencing the blog post and some of the changes about how you see the future of search, I wanted to know what some of the key investments you think the company needs to make so that search becomes more visual or relevant and what that might mean tying it back to the business for engagement with your products relevant to that medium to long term.
We are investing in image search and we do have products like Google Maps and Photos which all add to the visual experience.
And then for Ruth, as we start to look ahead to 2019, as you plan for 2019, how are you thinking about the relationship between revenue growth and dollars of operating income growth for next year, particularly if the macroeconomic environment were to become, let's say, less of a tailwind to the broader ads environment as it was this year and in prior years?
And so, and a lot of times that involves thinking across the whole stack, bringing together the entire experience in an integrated way for our users.
So we are investing in the long run because we see it clearly as an important business opportunity for us as well, so both go hand-in-hand.
And beyond that, we're looking at how the market adoption is and we are thoughtfully building a business but we are committed to building and investing for the long run.
We continue to invest here because we see ongoing opportunities in particular as we leverage machine learning to provide better experience for users and for advertisers.
But as we've talked about on prior calls, that's one element of it, and we continue to invest for opportunities that are sizable over the long term.
Sundar has already commented on both hardware and cloud as really important examples, and we think the steps that we're taking, the investments we're making, provide the foundational support for ongoing long-term sustained growth.
Could you just talk a little about how you think about the gaming opportunity for Alphabet, and what you think are the key factors you need to tackle to really build and scale direct-to-consumer facing cloud gaming product.
On your second question, look, we today serve our users on gaming across Google ads but in many ways, right.
And we're particularly excited about the opportunity with machine learning, because it opens up more services and products for users and for advertisers and for enterprise customers.
And so given our view about the long-term potential with these opportunities, we're very focused on ensuring that we have the needed compute capacity to support growth.
Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc. So in terms of your first question, we actually felt pretty good about the strength globally, which as I noted in opening comments, across the board, 20% growth in the U.S. on a $15 billion base.
And on your second question, one of the things we clearly see when we make a hardware product like Pixel, in which all the tools and the utilities we build are conveniently there integrated and the experience is great.
Look, I mean, I think on the first thing on e-commerce, maybe really in people, we do see a lot of activity in the vertical on our products, and we see strong growth there as well.
So we are continuing to invest there and we are also driving strong partnerships with the retail sector, both in terms of our shopping experiences as well as through cloud.
And on your broader question, look, the reason we are investing across Google and Alphabet in a set of areas is because as a company over the past 20 years, we have developed deep capabilities in technology, in computer science and especially with machine learning and AI.

google,q4,2018,"[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations.
Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights after which we will take your questions.
Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter: our total revenues of $39.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $724 million or $600 million after the impact of our hedging program.
APAC revenues were $6.1 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 32% in constant currency, reflecting weakness of the Australian dollar.
Our effective tax rate was 11.2% for the fourth quarter, reflecting a discrete benefit due to the reversal of an accrual made as a result of updated guidance associated with the U.S Tax Act. Net income was $8.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $12.77.
I'll cover results for the full-year 2018 because it remains most instructive to look at the financials for Other Bets over a longer-term horizon, as we've discussed on prior calls.
For the full-year 2018, Other Bets revenues were $595 million, up 25% versus 2017 primarily generated by Fiber and Verily.
In terms of gross margin, the biggest component within cost of revenues remains our traffic acquisition costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business.
And our core area such as search maps new use YouTube under computing and advertising platforms continue their strong momentum.
Thanks to our strengths in AI and Search, Google Lens uses your smartphone camera to help identify more than 1 billion products.
YouTube continues to invest in its thriving community of creators and build great features for its nearly 2 billion monthly log in users.
Ariana Grande's premiere of her official music video for Thank U, Next in November holds the record for biggest music video debut in YouTube history earning over $55 million views in its first day.
Since the product launch in March 2018 over 30% of the advertisers who use TrueView for action were new to buying inc and video ads on YouTube.
It was another record year for our Google home family of devices, with million sold this holiday season.
For example, people use Google home devices to cook over 16 million recipes this holiday season.
Google Cloud is a fast-growing multibillion-dollar business that supports major global 5,000 companies in every important vertical with a robust enterprise organization.
There is an important long-term investment that lay the groundwork for our future computing needs primarily to x-rayed machine learning across our businesses.
More than 20 years in there is still tremendous opportunity for Google to help people save time, learn new things, grow their businesses and build stronger communities.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.
But I was wondering if maybe you can share with us what youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in terms of year-over-year growth rate, and in particular are they growing faster than what the competitors disclosed in their public results?
It sounds like on branded advertising and now some of these new direct response ads.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
Do you think thatÃ¢ÂÂs the right long-term rate for Google Play?
And IÃ¢ÂÂm just curious that it seems like the core is very strong, but is there hesitation that youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing in terms of valuation or other factors that are playing into that relative to what your peers are doing right now?
We have a strong 2018, with total revenues of $136.8 billion, up 23% over 2017, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing investments to deliver exceptional experiences for users and compelling returns for our advertisers, partners and enterprise customers.
For the fourth quarter, revenues of $39.3 billion or up 22% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency, as we continue to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud and Desktop Search.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $17.9 billion, up 26% year-on-year.
The key drivers were: first, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, mostly for our advertising supported content in what is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV which have higher CAC as a percentage of revenues.
Growth in Sales and marketing expenses reflect increases in sales and marketing headcount primarily for Cloud and Ads followed by advertising investments mainly in Search and the Assistant.
Other revenues for Google were $6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year fueled by Cloud, Hardware and Play.
The increase in the sites' TAC rate year-over-year was driven by the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, followed by changes in partner agreements offset by the seasonally higher proportion of YouTube advertising revenues in the fourth quarter.
With eight products, with more than 1 billion users each and more people coming online every day, we remain excited by the opportunities to continue to create valuable experiences for users around the globe.
Machine learning is also driving differentiation for newer Google businesses, like Cloud and Hardware, as well as central to a number of Other Bets, most notably Waymo and Verily.
First, as weÃ¢ÂÂve said many times, we continuously work to enhance the user and advertiser experience because we make changes with a focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long-term, the timing of the introduction of new experiences, particularly, in search advertising can vary which can result in an impact on quarterly year-on-year growth.
In addition to our progress in AI we saw great traction across newer areas, like the Google assistant, hardware, and Cloud.
As we do this, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to do the right thing and are continuing to build privacy and security into the core of our products, keeping uses data safe and secure with the industry's best security systems and giving people better and clearer controls.
The Google assistant is a great example of how we help people throughout the day and we demonstrated that at CES last month with lots of exciting new partners and features.
I want thank every Googler around the world for making 2018, a great year for users and our business.
On the YouTube question, of course, our core effort is around the main YouTube product and that is what works at scale globally across the world and we are seeing continued engagement and it's doing very well.
And then in terms of revenue it's an investment in YouTube, overall, as Sundar said, we are --YouTube is continuing to benefit from the secular change the way users are consuming content and that's reflected in strong revenue growth.
It's growing at a strong pace and as I said in opening comments, we're particularly excited about the significant growth in direct response both TrueView for action and app promo formats are delivering a great value for users and advertisers, and that's driving growth across regions and channels.
Ruth did, I think, in terms of headcount growth in technical and sales roles and for the new leadership that you mentioned what is the things that the new -- that Thomas Kurian can kind of do Cloud to accelerate the next phase of growth in that business.
So, in terms of growth, Cloud does continue to deliver sizable revenue growth driven by GCP and GCP does remain one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet.
I was curious, Sundar, as you think about with an innovation focus, what do you see as being one or two of the biggest opportunities to further improve the quality or the efficacy of the ad product, you provide for advertisers on YouTube from here.
For example, if you look at something like the Google Home Hub and how it delivers a nice experience across Search, Assistant and YouTube and Photos when you wanted, you can definitely see the glimpse of the future.
We see users come to Google a lot around key shopping moments and we want to make sure we invest in the experience to get closer to what they want.
The main point is we remain very excited about the opportunities for users and advertisers, in particular, building off of Sundar's comment as we apply machine learning to solutions.
We know there's a lot of investment in Cloud and hardware and YouTube TV, but just would like to get a update on the health of the advertising business margins.
So, in terms of overall Google margins, I think that the main point you're seeing in the margins as we continue to see tremendous opportunity across Google, and so we're investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth.
We are continuing to see tremendous opportunity in the ads business, Search and Ads businesses and beyond machine learning we're further investing to continue to enhance the experience for users and advertisers, and that's across Mobile Desktop and YouTube.
And then, we are investing aggressively in our newer businesses within Google, particularly, Cloud and Hardware as Sunder has already said.
So what you're seeing reflected through in the margins on the cost of revenue side is the impact of the product mix that weÃ¢ÂÂve talked about, a big part of that is the ongoing strength in YouTube and then on the OpEx side investing in engineers, in particular, for Google as well as on the sales and marketing side, the increased headcount to support not just Ads, but in particular Cloud.
And then in terms of the pace of investments, IÃ¢ÂÂve already laid out the focus areas and our commitment to continue to invest to support long-term revenue and earnings growth and just wanted to put a fine point on both CapEx and headcount.
So with the scale of our business and with our focus on user experience, it does require CapEx. We are committed to continue to invest in CapEx to deliver on that.
So the reason I started by laying out, I think, in response to the question on margins where we're investing and how we look at is, we are very focused on investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth.

google,q1,2019,"Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.
The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher TAC as a percentage of revenues.
Operating expenses including the impact of the EC fine were $13.7 billion.
Google Cloud Platform remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet with strong customer momentum reflected in particular in demand for our compute and data analytics products.
What gives us these opportunities as GoogleÃ¢ÂÂs position to help people, businesses and society in countless ways through our products.
Just last week, we announced an improved job search experience in the U.S., that helps people easily discover quality remote jobs, allowing them to work right from home.
As one example, earlier this year YouTube announced changes that reduce recommendations of content that comes close to violating our guidelines or that misinforms in harmful ways.
More broadly, across our Ads business, our advertising product team led by Prabhakar continues to build new products for marketers, with more than 100 enhancements introduced every quarter.
Philip on our business teams had done a great job helping advertisers take full advantage of these new capabilities.
For instance, more than 70% of our advertisers are already using automated bit strategies and Google Ads and these MO powered technologies help customers get better results for their investments.
In Q1, we began testing new shoppable ad units and Google Images so brands can highlight multiple products available for sale in sponsored image results.
Not only our features like Night Sight in Pixel winning industry awards, but Net Promoter Scores tell us that many people who use our hardware products truly love them, which is particularly important as we move into this new era of computing.
We also announced innovations across many of our other products that enabled developers to build and deploy AI, help enterprises to better secure their data, allow Android users to leverage their phones as a security key and much more.
Today, a Google data center uses 50% less energy than a typical data center, while delivering seven times more computing power than we did five years ago.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.
We noticed that large than expected slowdown in the properties TAC in the quarter that includes cost of mobile search, while the other cost of revenues which includes YouTube content cost seem to maintain an expected growth rate despite what you said about more moderate turns in hardware.
So just wondering if thatÃ¢ÂÂs a wise way to infer anything about the relative performance of mobile search revenue versus YouTube from those cost lines in the quarter?
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.
I am excited that over the last three years, taking AI first approach we have really incorporated machine learning core -- in a core way across our product to benefit our users and thatÃ¢ÂÂs true for advertising as well.
But how much of the deceleration insights ex-FX was from maybe advertiser demand issues in these markets versus proactive changes that you may have made on your end to the product?
In the first quarter, total revenues of $36.3 billion were up 17% year-on-year and up 19% in constant currency, following a strong 2018.
On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment results, were $16 billion, up 19% year-on-year.
Network revenues were $5 billion up 8% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth AdMob followed by Google Ad Manager.
The Sites TAC rate was flat year-over-year, as the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC was offset by the growth in TAC free Sites revenue primarily from YouTube.
In terms of our key revenue drivers, with respect to Sites revenues, as we indicated last quarter, the timing of product changes in ads at times can have an impact on year-on-year growth rates.
We remain confident about the sizable opportunity ahead to improve the advertiser and user experience through our ongoing commitment to product innovation, in particular by leveraging machine learning across our ads products and properties.
Turning to profitability, with regard to Google OpEx, the first quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long-term.
In terms of sales and marketing, the pace of investment in Q1 reflected a timing shift in spend and we expect these expenses to pick up in the second quarter.
We continue to expect a sizable investment in both compute requirements to support long-term growth, as well as in office facilities.
We will always be a company thatÃ¢ÂÂs focus on the long-term willing to make investments that will help our businesses and our customerÃ¢ÂÂs businesses succeed as technology continues to evolve.
Today, I will start by talking about our core mission of making information universally accessible and useful, then I will provide an update on our computing video and advertising platforms, and finally, I will discuss our hardware and cloud efforts.
As part of our Google news initiative, we kicked off the local experiments project, working with local publishers to uncover new approaches to their business models and operations, so they can continue bringing great local content to the readers.
And then more to your question as we indicated last quarter, the other item is the timing of product changes in Ads can impact year-on-year growth rates and we make changes with the focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long-term we do not manage by quarter, so we are introducing enhancements only after product testing, and that was sort of the overarching color that I was trying to give you.
So, starting with clicks and CBCs. And so while YouTube Clicks continue to grow at a substantial pace in the first quarter, the rate of YouTube Click growth decelerated versus what was a strong Q1 last year reflecting changes that we made in early 2018, which we believe are overall additive to the user and advertiser experience.
And then in terms of your two spending the investment questions, in terms of headcount, first, we do continue to expect the growth rate to moderate slightly in 2019 from the year-on-year growth in 2018.
And so cloud has been and continues to be the primary area of headcount growth and as Thomas indicated as well, I think Sundar did as well.
But, overall, we continue to invest meaningfully in our technical infrastructure given our outlook for compute requirements to support long-term growth.
And this quarter, the constant TAC rate versus last year reflects ongoing growth in mobile, but it also benefited from growth in YouTube, where the associated content and cost are included in other cost of sales, and so, thatÃ¢ÂÂs the most important thing to point to.
And so we are having conversations across the Board and I think people are definitely engaging in a very committed way and they are investing in it and so itÃ¢ÂÂs up to us to bring it all together and have a compelling service later this year and thatÃ¢ÂÂs what the team has had done working on.
And just so we can understand a little bit, can you just help us with the key user experience you are trying to solve for and sort of the message to your advertisers who maybe spending -- or maybe growing their spend last now and why itÃ¢ÂÂs going to be positive for the long-term?
Really, just help us understand how that hardware business is important to Google and how you are thinking about it long-term?
So in terms of the Mobile Search and the SiteÃ¢ÂÂs revenue more broadly, I think, the main point, as we have both tried to indicate in opening comments is, we view the advertising opportunity is significant, given, in particular, the opportunity with machine learning, both for users and advertisers, as well as our commitments to product innovation and being the backdrop of an environment, which nearly half of the budgets in the U.S. are still spent offline and about 90% of commerce in the U.S. is still offline and we are focused on digital playing bigger role in that and tapping into other marketing budgets, by offering an attractive ROI.
And then more broadly, within YouTube, as we talked about last quarter, we do continue to see significant growth in direct response and we remain excited about the upside potential there.
And so for -- computing will continue to evolve even beyond phones and so we want to make sure we are in there and we are very committed to it for the long-term.
So in terms of the regions, the year-on-year growth rates reflect the product comments that I have made with respect to the first quarter.
And I donÃ¢ÂÂt think there are any demand issues to the last part of your question, and as we said earlier, we work through a set of product development pipeline in a very disciplined way focused on user experience and that makes itÃ¢ÂÂs way too and thatÃ¢ÂÂs how we approach it.

google,q2,2019,"Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures maybe considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
We made several big announcements at I/O, YouTube's Brandcast, and Google Marketing Live.
Google Maps can also help people stay safe in times of crisis.
Last month, we added more visual information and a new navigation warning system to help you understand where the natural disaster is and better anticipate where it may be headed.
Building a more helpful Google for everyone means that everyone should be able to access and enjoy our products.
Demand across our helpful Home products continues to increase as we expand to new markets.
At Brandcast, we introduced two important changes that help advertisers reach new audiences with premium content.
Moving from YouTube to broader advertising platforms, at Google Marketing Live we introduced new ad formats such as Discovery ads, which offer a new visually rich mobile-first ad experience across Google properties.
Anthos, announced earlier this year, provides advanced security and open architecture to support multi-and hybrid Cloud environments.
That's important to many companies, including financial services customers like HSBC and new clients such as KeyBanc.
Finally Google Cloud's AI and ML solutions are also helping healthcare organizations, like Sanofi, accelerate drug discovery and as such, improve the healthcare experience and outcomes.
Finally, to support our rapidly growing cloud customer base and all of Google services globally, we broke ground on three data centers and launched our new Osaka Cloud region, the seventh in Asia Pacific.
And right here at home, we announced a $1 billion investment in housing across the Bay Area to help address the chronic shortage of affordable housing.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses.
In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search.
Other revenues for Google were $6.2 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fuelled by Cloud with an ongoing strong contribution from Play.
G Suite continues to be a valid set of productivity and work transformation apps with the results benefiting from both new pricing and seed growth.
Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.9 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities and data centres followed by service.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
I think what's notable here is that every year at GML, we announced new changes to products and features and most ads product launches are introduced in phases as advertisers initially experiment with new formats.
And so I just wanted to add in here because while we're excited about the new ads products we announced to GML last quarter, given they offer great new user experiences across new services, we don't view this year's slate of launches differently from introductions made in previous years.
Growth in GCP was led by strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products and G Suite continues to deliver strong growth, as I noted in the opening comments, with the results benefiting from both new pricing and [C] [ph] growth.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC.
I guess with that as a backdrop with the overall acceleration, can you just give us a couple examples, what types of products or advertisers segments or regions resonate particularly well on YouTube this quarter versus last quarter?
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.
And then just second coming back to Google Marketing Live notwithstanding your comments Ruth that it take some time for products to be adopted.
And our next question comes from Mark May from Citi.
And I was hoping you might provide a couple of specific examples of how the company is leveraging machine learning recently to help drive growth and improvements for both users and advertisers?
First off, as you embrace more commerce and payments on the platform broadly speaking along with the new ad formats you've talked about, can you also talk about what role take rates might play in terms of future initiatives and revenue growth?
To make products work even harder for you, we have continued to invest in our hardware business, bringing together the best of Google's hardware, software, and AI.
Now on to our Cloud business, Q2 was another strong quarter for Google Cloud, which reached an annual revenue run rate of over $8 billion and continues to grow at a significant pace.
We continue to build our world-class cloud team to help support our customers and expand the business and are looking to triple our salesforce over the next few years.
Ahead of the games, we are working with the City of Tokyo to ensure Japanese businesses can better serve new customers and help visitors make the most of their time there using products like Search, Maps and Translate.
The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centres and other operations, including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues.
Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 9% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth within network, namely Google Ad Manager followed by AdMob. Within Cloud, growth in GCP was once again in the primary driver of performance, with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products.
The sites TAC rate increased year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, offset by the growth in TAC free sites revenues, primarily from YouTube.
With respect to Sites revenues, the strength in the second quarter again reflects our ongoing innovation in part from the benefits of applying machine learning.
In fact, in the second quarter of 2019, as Sundar mentioned, the annual run rate for Cloud revenues was over $8 billion and Cloud continues to deliver significant growth.
In terms of our hardware business, we were pleased with the reception of the Pixel 3a line-up of mid-tier smartphones in the second quarter and look forward to the fourth quarter launch of our newest devices, some of which we showcased at I/O.
With regard to Google operating expenses, the second quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long-term.
Our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments.
Can you give us a little bit of additional color on what some of the key investments you're making, some of the key themes you're trying to drive after in terms of pushing the organization to collaborate on product launches and leveraging the strength within Google?
Beyond that be it, the focus on cloud has been a big part of it, continuing to scale up YouTube including being focused on content responsibility.
And I do think they go hand-in-hand as we are making the experience better for customers, including on products like Discover.
And the key point that I'll just reiterate is that as much as there is a lot of innovation going on in the business and we've talked about that, we introduced product changes only after extensive testing and that means there can be variability in quarterly growth rates as you've seen.
And as we discussed last quarter, there can be timing variability and our view is let's ensure that we stay focused on the right things for the long-term and the quality that we can deliver.
The primary thing is we remain focused on investing for long-term growth and the primary use of capital really is to support that growth.
So in terms of YouTube growth, just maybe to add a bit more there given your question.
And so the click and CPC growth are unrelated to actions on policy enforcement in terms of our ongoing efforts to protect the YouTube ecosystem, we do remain focus and taking the right steps in line with our goals, regardless of impact on the revenues.
I think earlier Ruth had mentioned the importance of machine learning for driving growth in the quarter, and I'm sure in many recent quarters.
Getting a lot of questions and wondering, if you think about that, really affecting Google operations.
We are very focused on investing to support the ongoing growth we see across Google in particular as we're talking about in Search while we're also investing to build new businesses most notably in Cloud as we've talked a lot about here today.
But the mega point is that we are excited about the long-term opportunity and we're continuing to invest which is why in opening comments, I wanted to make sure to call out what we're seeing with respect to ongoing investments and across the business the increases in headcount and the reasons for them at the benefits of those investments as well as sales and marketing and the fact that that is back half loaded and -- back half weighted I should say.
We are committed to continue to invest for what we see as a long-term opportunities.
And on the mobile question, we are definitely investing in Android with a focus on the next billion users as well as making sure the mobile experience continues to evolve.
So, being helpful to users and helping them navigate it be it Search, Assistant, Maps, and YouTube I think we are focused on the opportunities there.
And in terms of the next billion users there's a lot of headroom there over time and we are focused on.
",50.8,0.8164982
google,q3,2019,"Q3 was another great quarter at Google with strong revenue growth driven by mobile search, YouTube, and Cloud.
First, powered by our long-term investment in AI, we dramatically improved our understanding of the questions people ask Google Search.
In Search, we made a number of improvements to make it easier for users to find key moments in videos, easily find products within images via Google Lens, and discover new podcast.
This quarter, we expanded inventory for our very popular App Campaigns to include new services, including YouTube search, display video ads and the Discover feed.
Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.6 billion, up 23% year-on-year.
Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $7.2 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities and data centers, followed by servers.
As weÃ¢ÂÂve often discussed, we manage our business for the long term and not on a quarterly basis, and we remain very-focused on continuing to enhance the experience for users and advertisers over the long term.
Looking forward, we anticipate the primary driver of CapEx investment will continue to be our expected compute requirements, particularly to support ongoing demand for machine learning across our business as well as for Cloud, Search and YouTube.
Can you just talk about what some of the key investments you want to make to capitalize on that opportunity into long-term?
In general, local is an important area for us, and we are continuing to invest in building experience that connects merchants, advertisers and users.
Can you just talk about some of the KPIs that you monitor or what you're seeing when it comes to query volumes, click through rate, overall response time, what are you seeing that sort of gives you confidence that youÃ¢ÂÂll continue to get more and more relevant results for your users?
And I think one of the things that weÃ¢ÂÂve been very focused on is that innovations that benefit mobile also enhance the desktop experience for users and advertisers.
But, to give you a sense of -- we continue to take that work deeper, we realize users sometimes do searches through sessions understanding what is their satisfaction across the session, what is their engagement, are they getting at what they are looking for?
So, as we look out towards like 2020 and beyond, do you feel like a lot of the product queue is in a good place, as far as Search and YouTube are concerned, and that these product changes might be a little bit more subtle going forward, or could we return to having more meaningful impact in the future, just any color there?
So, in terms of the first question, I think, as Sundar and I talked about, we're pleased with the strength of the business that you've seen here again in the third quarter.
And I think to your question, our view is that quarterly growth around the rates you've seen since the beginning of the year, for us underscore the strength and the vibrancy actually in our business.
And we are continuing to invest in long-term opportunities.
But, I think also implicit in your question, at 26% year-on-year growth on a fixed FX basis, running it about now $7 billion in quarterly revenues, weÃ¢ÂÂre really pleased with all what the team is doing and the year-on-year growth rate.
So, these are -- we want to be helpful to users in a way that makes sense for them, more continually, and the combination of Search and Discover helps us do that.
It really cuts across every element of what we do, what weÃ¢ÂÂre doing in our technical infrastructure, the way weÃ¢ÂÂre thinking about our products that Sundar talked about, what we're doing with our facilities, what we're doing with AI.
Given our outlook in particular across Google, we do expect to see ongoing demand for compute investments to support our growth, particularly for machine learning, Cloud, Search and YouTube.
And the primary driver of the CapEx does continue to be our expectations for compute requirements, so investments in technical infrastructure, as we've talked about today.
So, overall, I think, engaging users with premium offerings on YouTube is the focus for us.
That does continue to reflect the changes that we made in early 2018 to really improve the user and advertiser experience.
Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

The biggest contributor again this quarter was costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues.
Within Cloud growth in GCP was once again the primary driver of performance with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products, complemented by ongoing growth in G Suite, reflecting both new pricing and seat growth.
Within other revenues, in addition to continued strength in compute, Google Cloud saw substantial growth from data analytics as customers are seeing the benefits from implementing BigQuery.
[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets.
I know thatÃ¢ÂÂs for marketing earlier in the year that that seems like that's now at a stage where it's going to be better integrated into the -- I don't know, the purchase path or whatever, you're making it easier for small businesses to tap into what should be really nicely qualified leads.
And then, maybe just elaborate a bit on the long-term vision of moving shopping functionality into properties like YouTube and how you think that experience will evolve?
Obviously Search is an important area, Image Search, YouTube, Maps all great surfaces by which I think users come with varying degrees of commercial interest, looking to discover and at times transact as well.
But, I'm wondering how do you think about the increase in scrutiny and oversight possibly impacting your ability to explore new services or new markets over time, and ultimately to remain competitive?
So, markets like APAC continue to be bit long term opportunities for us as well.
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.
Sundar spoke at length about your investments in renewable energy earlier and maybe keeping with the theme of the earnings call, you could help us understand how that is or maybe is not helping drive efficiencies across the country -- across the Company and your operating costs overall?

The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, and then content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content in what has been a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our newer paid YouTube music and premium subscription services, as well as YouTube TV, which have higher content acquisition costs as a percentage of their revenues.

Search and other Google properties continue to drive great results with total revenues in 2019 of $98 billion and strong growth.
Google Cloud ended 2019 at a more than $10 billion run rate, up 53% year-on-year, driven by significant growth in GCP.
As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased with YouTube's growth in advertising and subscriptions and we are also pleased with the early results from other revenue options we offer creators, including memberships, brand integrations, merchandise, and ticket sales.
This means optimizing our usage of computing resources and also growing business opportunities in areas like YouTube, Cloud, Play, hardware and beyond.
Our results were driven by ongoing strength in Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud offset by a decline in hardware revenues.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles, including the impact of the Looker acquisition, which closed in December.
Google Search and other advertising revenues were 27.2 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing momentum in mobile and desktop.
YouTube advertising revenues were 4.7 billion, up 31% year-on-year, driven by substantial growth in direct response and ongoing healthy growth and brand advertising, which remains the largest component.
Revenues were 2.6 billion for the fourth quarter, up 53% year-over-year, driven by significant growth at GCP and ongoing strong growth and G Suite.
In the fourth quarter, other revenues were 5.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube and Play offset by declines in hardware.
What's exciting for us as we look ahead at Search and other Google properties is the ongoing opportunity to support users and advertisers with new ads experiences and improved measurement.
Second, with respect to YouTube advertising, at a year-on-year growth rate more than 30% in the fourth quarter weÃ¢ÂÂre pleased with the ongoing strength and opportunity at YouTube.
As Sundar shared earlier, the non-advertising services at YouTube, mainly from subscriptions reached a $3 billion revenue run rate in the fourth quarter.
Within technical infrastructure, the investments in particular support ongoing demand for machine learning across our business, as well as for Cloud, Search, Ads, and YouTube.
Sundar, to you first Ã¢ÂÂ a lot of innovation that company put on display over the past year, Ruth talked in her sort of forward commentary section about sustainability of growth and outperformance going forward.
When I look at Ã¢ÂÂ we do see a lot of commercial experiences across our properties, be it Search or YouTube and the opportunity to create a better experience there and hence bring more value to our users.
And across our businesses be it YouTube, Cloud, Play, or hardware in addition to search, you know we are seeing strength in a lot of these areas and we share a common technological approach across all of them.
And then on your second question, at our scale, we're pleased with the rate of growth in 2019 here in Search and our ads business overall and we do see ample opportunity ahead.
When we look at the biggest investment areas within Google, we, as we've talked about already on this call, continue to be focused on investing to support the growth that we see.
When we make it contextually relevant, what we have done in Search and search ads over time, if we can bring that to YouTube when we see an opportunity, I think that sets us up well for the long term there.
So, last year, we set up a core infrastructure team, which looks at things like how does the user journey work across, what does the shared infrastructure engineers can use so that we don't reinvent the wheel in multiple areas, how can we commonly deploy AI across all these products?
Google Assistant is a great example of Ã¢ÂÂ because we are focused on the user and the experience cuts across several of our product areas.
However, the point that we were trying to make and have made a couple of times here on the call is we are investing aggressively in Cloud overall given the opportunity that we see and the momentum we're having and we'll continue to do so.
We're putting a sharper focus on this, as Sundar indicated, looking at where does it make sense to work with external capital as we did with Verily as an example, but the bigger point is, we continue to invest for the long term, and when we look at our capital return approach, it's very consistent with what we've talked about previously.
The primary use of capital continues to be to support long-term growth in Google and in Other Bets, and then it's about strategic investments and on top of that return of capital to shareholders.
And as you said, the other cost of sales does reflect lower expenses related to Hardware in Q4, in particular, versus last year, but I think the main point to leave you with is that we do intend to continue to invest aggressively to support growth in the areas that we've already talked about quite a bit on this call, in Search, in Cloud, in Hardware and in YouTube.
And he mentioned the transactional part of the funnel and I think it's an area where he brings a lot of experience given his prior work, but we definitely see opportunity to improve the overall user experience in terms of how we present our results, the visual nature of it, making that experience more delightful.

google,q1,2020,"Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Ultimately, weÃ¢ÂÂll see a long-term acceleration of movement from businesses to digital services, including increased online work, education, medicine, shopping and entertainment.
This is a testament to strategic areas where we have invested over recent years, products that people trust, our technical leadership and innovation, deep partnerships, a highly skilled workforce, and the scale and resilience of our operations.
And finally, creating sustainable value, weÃ¢ÂÂll be optimizing the way our data centers work and prioritizing strategic areas of investment where we need to support our users and partners.
At the same time, even through March, our non-advertising revenue lines maintain their strong performance, particularly Google Cloud.
IÃ¢ÂÂll provide more details on the impact of the crisis as I review the Google segment revenue results and conclude with an update to the outlook that I shared on our fourth quarter call.
In the first quarter, our total revenues were $41.2 billion, up 13% year-on-year and up 15% in constant currency, driven by Search, YouTube and Cloud.
Starting with Google Search and other advertising revenue, we generated $24.5 billion in revenues in the quarter that was up 9% year-over-year.
As a result by the end of March, total YouTube ads revenue growth had decelerated to a year-on-year growth rate in the high-single-digit.
In the first quarter, other revenues were $4.4 billion, up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues and play.
Within Play, app revenues continue to benefit from strong growth in the number of active buyers in the first quarter.
Let me now conclude with our thoughts on the impact of the global crisis on our revenues and investments including an update on the outlook I shared on our fourth quarter earnings call.
In terms of Google Cloud, we remain very pleased with the execution by the team, reflected in the ongoing pace of customer adoption of both GCP industry-specific solutions and G Suite collaboration tools to help businesses operate efficiently and effectively.
Although we are focused on these and other steps to moderate the overall pace of investment, we remain committed to the long-term opportunities for which we are well positioned, so we will continue to invest in these areas, including Search, Machine Learning and Google Cloud.
So across everything we do, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Play, be it Cloud, I think we are investing to capitalize on this long term opportunity.
First, I wanted to thank you for the color around the growth youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing as you were exiting the quarter in the ad business.
Thank you for the Ã¢ÂÂ so, in terms of ads revenue, as I said in opening comments, for our ads business a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance, which has tended to be correlated with ad spend.
And then, with YouTube, we had strong revenue growth until late in the quarter when trajectories for direct response and brand diverged.
And as I said, direct response does continue to have substantial growth throughout the quarter while brand began to experience a sizable headwind starting in mid-March.
That being said, the decline in our Search and other ads revenue was abrupt in March and although weÃ¢ÂÂre seeing some early signs at this point that users are returning to more commercial behavior, itÃ¢ÂÂs not clear how durable or monetizeable that will be.
In terms of overall priorities, I would say, weÃ¢ÂÂve always taken a long-term Ã¢ÂÂ on thinking through the arc of where things are going and our deep focus on AI, itÃ¢ÂÂs an example of that and weÃ¢ÂÂve been convinced for a while that those trends will play out in the long-term and so if anything through moments like that, the strong foundation we have built allows us to continue to be able to invest in our long-term area so AI is a good example of it.
Cloud and productivity software for businesses of all sizes is a deep area of investment and so the thesis still main so we continue to focus anywhere we think the actual work we are doing is based on deep technology, deep computing, a deep computational scale is the kind of investments we think still stand the test of time through things like, but beyond that we are actively looking at how user patterns are emerging so, for example, e-commerce is an area and you saw us respond through this with the changes we announced on our shopping property and going for comprehensiveness there and with new leaders in place weÃ¢ÂÂre going to be making sure we work on the user experience there.
And then Sundar, just to go back to your comments about the shift toward digital opportunities or digital transformation, if you talk to us about as you sort of look back over the last couple years at what youÃ¢ÂÂve done on the SMB side and what are sort of one or two of the key hurdles where you see you really need to invest and build more comprehensive SMB products for post recovery?
On the Ad side, a question Ã¢ÂÂ to your question about maybe I can give more qualitative cover to what was said earlier and we Ã¢ÂÂ the good thing about search ads and direct response on YouTube as well, but Search primarily is that, itÃ¢ÂÂs an extraordinarily effective system, itÃ¢ÂÂs a transparent system, you have a very clear sense of ROI, itÃ¢ÂÂs very measurable, highly cost-effective and so we have always seen and we saw this in 2008 as well, people respond in the short-term, but the recovery is also fast when it comes back and so it tends to work.
I mentioned earlier people are really thinking about the shift to digital so Philip and our ads team are super engaged with our customers helping them think through the opportunities through moments like that.
I earlier talked about, you can imagine, if youÃ¢ÂÂre a customer and you have data centers, these are fixed cost when you go through moments like this and so people are really looking at opportunities there and so our teams are super engaged, but I do want to acknowledge, maybe small businesses across the world are deeply impacted.
As a company we have announced several efforts to support small and medium businesses and we are going to be deeply engaged with them, but I think itÃ¢ÂÂs a tough journey we are all on and we look forward to working with them to help them through this.
So, going through a moment like this, itÃ¢ÂÂs very clear, part of what makes Google work well is, people come across a diverse range of needs and thatÃ¢ÂÂs true for shopping.
One of the tricky things about when you do that is making sure you donÃ¢ÂÂt have spam and youÃ¢ÂÂre managing and giving people good quality experiences and thatÃ¢ÂÂs where our deeper partnership, be it with PayPal and other providers so that we get the quality signals and really improve the experience as we improve comprehensiveness so both of them are going hand in hand and as we have demonstrated with Search, when we improve the organic experience the advertising experience also gives an opportunity and the system works well and so IÃ¢ÂÂm really excited about this change.
Sundar, the question for you really relates to the resiliency youÃ¢ÂÂre seeing within direct response piece of YouTube, like are there specific factors or is it a question of mix of advertisers there, thatÃ¢ÂÂs sustaining the growth?
On direct response, I do think, I think people are Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs a journey, and people who have been investing are seeing that it is cost effective, and so, over time more people are looking at it.
We have seen that the most pressing concern of small and large businesses right now is business continuity, solving for issues like employee safety, dramatic falls or surges in demand, supply chains and managing a remote workforce.
People are spending significantly more time on their Android apps with downloads of apps from Google Play rising 30% from February to March.
Last week, we surpassed a significant milestone and are now adding roughly 3 million new users each day and have seen a 30-fold increase in usage since January.
Vodafone is using Google Cloud platform to help that analyze network traffic flows to keep everyone connected, and we are helping Unity Technologies keep real time online games stay up and running.
Wing saw a surge in deliveries and new users, increasing its daily volume fivefold with great momentum in test programs in Australia and Virginia.
Our results for the first quarter are a tail of 2 quarters with strong results across our revenue lines for January and February followed by an abrupt decline in March in our advertising revenues, as governments globally instituted stay at home orders in response to COVID-19.
Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $11.5 billion, up 26% year-over-year primarily driven by Google-related expenses.
The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, and then content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTubeÃ¢ÂÂs advertising supported content followed by content costs for YouTube TV and our paid YouTube music and premium subscription services.
In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in Google Cloud for both technical and sales roles.
Significant YouTube revenue growth persisted until late in the first quarter with different performance trajectories for the brand and direct response components.
With respect to the implications of the global crisis for Google Cloud, weÃ¢ÂÂre proud of the accelerated traction we achieved across sectors, including public sector and healthcare for disease monitoring and control, working with leading retailers on demand forecasting working with companies across media and communications to enhance their customer service and across industries on supply chain optimization.
Total Traffic Acquisition Costs were $7.5 billion or 22% of total advertising revenue and up 9% year-over-year.
Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.7 billion, reflecting investments in data centers followed by servers and office facilities.
In terms of more specific product points, I will start with Search advertising where our financial results are driven in part by usersÃ¢ÂÂ search behavior.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.
And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Google Meet, have seen great traction and I gave Ã¢ÂÂ I mentioned some user momentum there, but we have more announcements coming up including later this week and so we are seeing tremendous traction and engagement on G Suite.
And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.
WeÃ¢ÂÂve been executing well over there for the past year and the growth on Google Pay has been strong and so being able to bring all of that together along with strong players like PayPal et cetera will help us give great experience for our users here.
Did you also see advertisers starting to come back?
",42.58,0.9703176
jpmc,q2,2015,"The improvement to both ratios was driven by net capital generation, along with an overall reduction to risk weighted assets primarily from lower risk across market and counterparty credit as well as some data enhancements with loan growth offsetting run off.
On the previous page you may have seen that HQLA was down $82 billion this quarter, primarily reflecting those lower levels of cash.
Quarter-on-quarter the reduction in cash drove a 4 basis point improvement was partially offset by lower yields and as I said, Firm NII was flat.
Net interest income was flat sequentially with modest spread compression offset by deposit growth and NIR was up 7% seasonally and 2% year-on-year on continued strong client investment and debit revenue.
WeÂve recently signed several new strategic clients, including Chevron, Cinemark, Gap Inc., Marriott and Rite Aid. Together they represent an incremental 5% to our volume and the majority have signed up for ChaseNet. Lastly in Auto, results continue to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales and stable used car values.
This quarter we continued to rank number one in global IB fees with 8.2% wallet share and widening the gap for number two.
Given the reporting changes weÂve made going forward, we should expect that for treasury services revenues would be about $875 million plus or minus per quarter and lending approximately $350 million and thatÂs given the trade finance transfer.
WeÂre fully expecting to see normal seasonal declines in the third quarter markets revenues.
We also saw continued momentum in IB revenue off of a record last quarter which was driven by a large transaction.
C&I loans grew 3% sequentially in line with the industry with middle market growth being somewhat challenged by strong competition, but with more strength in corporate client banking, driven by short-term financing activity and new facilities for our existing client base.
Driven by continued net long term inflows marking the 25th consecutive quarter at $13 billion with strength in North America and multi-asset flows, driving record AUM of $1.8 trillion up 4% year-on-year and client assets of $2.4 trillion.
My first question is the capital progress has clearly been solid this quarter.
So we actually havenÂt really changed our point of view since Investor Day and previously about the fact that we are expecting retail deposit and there are other people who have slightly different views, but we are expecting retail deposit to reprice higher and faster in this cycle than in previous rising rate cycles, given the competition so good high quality LTR compliant retail deposit, given the advancements in mobile banking, given the awareness in the general environment around low rates and the desire to participate in rising rates.
I see your markets revenue are down 1% year-over-year the way you look at this, but IÂm trying to reconcile that with JamieÂs comments two months ago at a New York conference where you said there is repricing in rates, derivatives, prime brokerage clearing and trade finance.
Yes. I mean, I just give you some very specific things and I will tell you why it's hard to figure out exactly what shows up.
In other categories, clients are like deposits we haven't seen repricing effectively.
Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
Marianne mentioned it, but emphasis, Chase Paymentech which youÂre seeing really good growth probably 50% fast in the industry.
I think weÂre doing a great job servicing clients.
Can you give us some color on what youÂre seeing whether itÂs underwriting standards and what kind of product type in the middle market that is most competitive?
But then I look at like total assets in the CIB, its $845 billion this quarter versus $846 billion last year.
Just following up on the markets discussion, curious whether or not youÂve seen some of the drama around Greece impact the M&A discussions in Europe this quarter and maybe an update on the IB Bank backlog at this point?
The M&A we donÂt Greece has expected the M&A dialogue very much, because itÂs been very active pretty much around the world.
And mostly around the world itÂs also like European companies coming to America, American companies going to Europe et cetera and those conversations continue Â
Psychologically maybe itÂs going to affect some people, but I donÂt see why a company that has its own ambitions is going to change them because of Greece.
Marianne gave you all very specific guidelines which you donÂt normally do on treasury services, investor services and expenses in the commercial bank because a lot of you have your models wrong.
Because I got a few questions on whether the deposit betas being a little faster means that the NIM trajectory is likely to be different from last time rates rose for you guys.
Okay, because the last time rates rose your NIM didnÂt move up that much.
The quarterÂs performance was characterized by strong underlying fundamentals across each of our businesses with stable NIM and NII, good growth in fee drive as well as strong IB fees, good expense discipline with adjusted expenses flat quarter-on-quarter at $14.2 billion and an adjusted overhead ratio of 58% and low levels of charge offs and core loans up 12% year-on-year.
Year-to-date our balance sheet is down over $120 billion on a spot basis, driven by a reduction of over $100 billion of non-operating deposits across our wholesale businesses partially offset by continued growth in consumer deposits.
We also saw a $36 billion reduction in trading assets and secured financing as we continue to make progress simplifying our balance sheet.
The performance for the combined consumer businesses was characterized by sequential revenue growth on stronger fee revenue and positive operating leverage, generating $2.5 billion of net income, an ROE of 19% and an overhead ratio of 56%.
Moving to consumer business banking on Page 6, CBB generated net income of $831 million, flat quarter-on-quarter and down 8% year-on-year with an ROE of 28%.
Average deposit balances up 9% or $41 billion year-on-year and weÂre pleased to see that 30% of this growth is driven by our investments in Business Banking and CPC and new builds.
Client investment assets were a record, up 8% to $16 billion and in Business Banking Average loan balances were up 6% with loan originations flat against a record last year and in a highly competitive environment.
Total revenue increased sequentially, primarily driven by higher MSR revenue, but as you can see -- you look at our non-interest revenue itÂs down $500 million year-on-year.
We still expect non-interest revenue to be down about $1 billion for the full-year in line with previous guidance.
Expenses of $1.1 billion were down $200 million or 15% year-on-year and down 9% quarter-on-quarter despite higher volume as we continue to manage down our costs.
On credit, we continue to see improvements in home prices and delinquencies and as a result we released $300 million of NCI reserve this quarter and you can see our charge-off rate were 21 basis points.
Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 3% year-on-year on Card sales volume and Auto loan and lease growth, partially offset by spread compression.
Moving on to markets, revenue of $4.5 billion was down 1% year-on-year, excluding business simplification and the gain in the prior year on the IPO of market which we previously disclosed, but with strong relative performance and rates and in equity markets.
And as I mentioned, equity market had another strong quarter, up 27% year-on-year on revenue of $1.6 billion with strong performance in all three regions relative to last year and outperformance in Asia, particularly China and Hong Kong on the back of client interests first to participate in the rally and later to hedge.
Looking forward, business simplification would drive a 9% decline year-on-year in third-quarter markets revenues with a corresponding decline in expenses.
And as I look into the third quarter in analyst models, I see relative to our markets results this quarter you have revenues in markets going up sequentially.
In commercial Banking the underlying businesses continue to perform well with strong loan growth, up $6 billion quarter-on-quarter and record end of period loan balances with good credit fundamentals and low non-performing loans.
Revenue was flat year-on-year driven by continued spread compression in loans and deposits, partially offset by growth in loans and flat sequentially despite the record investment banking performance in the first quarter.
CRE loans grew 5% and continue to exceed the industry on strong activity in both commercial term lending, which had record originations in the quarter and in real estate banking.
Moving on to Page 11 and Asset Management, net income of $451 million on revenue of $3.2 billion, reflected solid growth up 6% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter.
So to wrap up, strong reported and strong underlying results this quarter across our businesses and an environment that continue to remain somewhat challenging with double-digit core loan growth, with broad-based strength in our underlying drivers, and with continued execution and excellent progress against our capital, our balance sheet and expense commitments.
And I guess the question is in two parts: one, what do you think the chances are of the -- any or all of the CCAR surcharge or the CET1 surcharge to be included in CCAR; and two, what are the next steps in terms of business model adjustments, if that did pass?
Meanwhile, as you know, we are -- and by the way, it happens for us, it happens for everyone and weÂve shown you before not that -- good outcome, but weÂve shown you before that we think that regardless the competitive peers set that we have is going to cluster at or around similar capital levels.
So it's kind of a whole of the amount of things taking place in there, but the goal is to get a proper return to your capital not necessarily to show revenue growth in that line-item.
But the second is we will likely look to potentially push a little farther, but if we get harder and harder, each margin, the next $5 billion or $10 billion, as you get more and more closely aligned operating accounts in operating business and we have always said that we want to do this for the right reason for capital efficiency, but not do it in a way that its going to materially harm our clients.
In terms of revenue impact, not very much right now as you might very well know, because you can see that the balance is much more on a spot basis than on an average basis, but the equation looking forward will be much the same as said at Investor Day, approximately 25 basis points revenue on approximately $100 billion average for half a year, but that would be some expense benefit on FDIC cost etcetera, so not a very big number.
Yes, so let me do this in two parts and I'm going to start with the consumer businesses where the commitment is actually a couple of years old and we are sort of well low on our way to delivering against, the commitment $2 billion in Â17 versus Â14 and its not exactly linear, but you can consider it to flow through time and if you look at the CCB page on whatever page that is, I think we show that for the first half of the year our expenses are down over the first half of last year by $0.5 billion.
So if I have to look at the first half of Â15 versus the first half of Â14, take the 500 in consumer and business simplification in the CIB space, thatÂs probably the right way to size it about a quarter so far this year.
So thatÂs a little better, but obviously on the standardized you have somewhat put pressure as we continue to grow those really great loans that weÂre growing.
We built another modest reserve at this quarter, and we said we donÂt -- we might expect more reserves in the second half of the year, thereÂs another redetermination cycle in the fall and its -- IÂm not going to say likely, but its possible weÂll be selectively downgrading some time.
Your commentary about credit, so the second half is in line, youÂre $4 billion plus and you had a $1 billion of charge offs this quarter again.
Are we getting to a point where youÂre lapping some of these higher reward costs in growth and new accounts, we should start to see that revenue line track more closely with spending or is this something unusual this quarter.
And yes over time as spread compression abates and we continue to drive strong growth with the quality of our products and our partnerships, we would expect that to start too agile.
I just want to point out that trading, if you look at it over a long period of time itÂs been -- weÂve become very consistent.
We know that that the refis have started to come down but the purchase market has been stronger I think than people expected in the second quarter.
And remember if you look at the whole relationship side, I forgot the exact number, but if you look at middle market relationships, I think somewhat like half maybe even a little bit less of the revenues are from the lending.
So you would see, I think Gordon said approximately 150 net down in each of the next couple of years and thatÂs probably still the right way to look at it, but its really perfecting that it worth moving branches to the areas we like, whether the high density of affluence.
Hi, I was just curious about the reduction of the non-operating deposits, and I would have expected that to come mainly out of the Corporate and Investment Bank and -- but when you look at the disclosures on your average asset level itÂs essentially been $850 billion plus/minus each over the last five quarters.
You see securities going down but strong loan growth offsetting and then small reductions in trading and secured financing.
Yes, I think if you go back to last quarter Brennan and take a look at the remarks in last quarter, we talked about the change in presentation of some expenses versus revenues for the ADR business, that drove a reduction but just a classification issue and then in addition we did loose a large client at the end of last year and that is having an impact.
And I think itÂs a mistake not to grow because youÂre going to have tough times.
We expect that and weÂre going to look right through that and the fact that their -- and also the market went from $4 trillion value, so its $10 trillion economy.
Marianne, earlier on you were talking about deposit betas and for a lot of very good reasons, expecting that deposit betas will be a little bit faster this time around.
ThatÂs what weÂre trying to do and itÂs all in that number that we present it and we donÂt think thatÂs changed dramatically.

jpmc,q3,2015,"If you exclude tax adjustments, legal expense and net reserve releases, our adjusted performance was $1.32 a share with a 12% return on tangible common equity.
The consumer business had strong performance with loan growth across products driving overall firm-wide core loan of 15%.
And asset management revenues reflected lower market levels, driving weaker client sentiment and transactional revenues.
Also reflected in our results is a net reserve release of $281 million pretax, which reflects a little less than $600 million of consumer reserve releases as favorable credit trends continue, offset by a build of a little over $300 million in wholesale, approximately $160 million of which is additional reserves associated with the oil and gas sector, given expectations that energy prices will remain lower for longer.
We continue to make progress against our capital targets and, as expected, advanced and standardized fully phased in CET1 ratios in line with each other at 11.4% this quarter.
Total deposits are only down $90 billion, reflecting growth in more stable balances, particularly consumer.
The combined consumer businesses generated $2.6 billion of net income and an ROE of 20%.
Underlying business drivers are strong, and based on the 2015 FDIC deposit survey which just came out, we grew our deposits nearly two times the industry growth rate.
CBB generated strong results, with net income of $954 million and an ROE of 32%.
Business banking loan growth remained strong, with average loan balances up 6% year on year and originations up 4% from a strong 2014.
Expenses of $1.1 billion were down 13% year on year despite higher volumes as we continued to manage down our costs.
Expense was $2.2 billion, up 8% year on year driven by higher auto lease depreciation and higher marketing spend.
We grew wallet share by 150 basis points year over year, maintaining our number two ranking.
We maintained our number one ranking, gaining 30 basis points of share.
Treasury services revenue were flat quarter on quarter but down 4% year on year on lower deposit spread, with underlying transaction volumes remaining stable.
Revenue of $4.3 billion was down 6% adjusted for business simplification, with mixed results in fixed income but another strong performance in equities.
Equity markets had another strong quarter with revenues of $1.4 billion, up 9% year on year, driven by reasonably broad strength across products and regions, with good performance in cash, but particular strength in Asia and derivatives.
If markets remain at these levels, fourth quarter revenues will also be lower than previous guidance.
Commercial banking generated net income of $518 million on revenue of $1.6 billion and an ROE of 14%.
Pipelines are trending higher in C&I and remain robust in commercial real estate, our expansion market loan balances are up 20% year on year, calling activity is up substantially across client segments, and we've added around 400 new middle market relationships this year.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect revenues to show normal seasonality from this low base, assuming current market levels.
And AUM of $1.7 trillion and client assets of $3.3 trillion held up well and were relatively flat year on year, with negative markets and outflows driving a 4% sequential decline.
And lastly, we continued to report strong investment performance with 81% of mutual fund AUM ranked in the first or second quartiles over five years.
And finally, firm-wide NIM was up 7 basis points quarter on quarter given the mix shift away from cat and securities towards higher loan balances and on an overall smaller balance sheet.
Yes. The most important thing we want you to take away from talking about our co-brand partners is that we feel great about having signed up United Airlines and Southwest Airlines and partnering with them again for the medium term.
I would take a slightly different perspective on the jobs report, the non-firm [ph] payrolls, and not to sort of overthink it, but while I know it was somewhat lower than people were expecting or possibly hoping for, it still at around 140,000 was almost two times what would be required to have stable unemployment.
So the fact that we've got a smaller interest-earning asset base and more loans and less cash and less securities should be supported, even on flat rates.
You noted that you think that net interest income could grow next year even if rates stay low.
So we've taken some modest reserves in the last few quarters and our overall reserve number obviously is consistent with our expectations based upon the outlook for oil prices.
Obviously I'm not saying that there may not be any net incremental reserve build, but we're not expecting them to be significant.
So if energy prices stay around these levels and recover slowly, we're expecting net not to have material incremental reserves in the next quarter.
While we're on the balance sheet, you can see on the call-out on the page that on a spot basis our balance sheet is down $160 billion year to date and an incremental $32 billion this quarter, as we reduced non-operating deposits by over $150 billion, exceeding our commitment.
Originations of $30 billion were up 41% from the prior year and up slightly quarter on quarter as we benefited from a strong pipeline and continued improvement in the purchase market.
We continued to add high-quality loans to our balance sheet, totaling $19 billion this quarter.
We expect non-interest revenue to be down around $250 million year over year in the fourth quarter.
And revenue of $4.8 billion was up 2% year on year, on higher operating lease income in auto, as well as card revenue up slightly, reflecting higher NII on volume, spread and lower interest reversals, offset by the impact of changes to some of our co-brand partnerships.
However, expect the revenue rate for the fourth quarter to be 11.75% plus or minus.
In banking, it was a strong quarter with IB revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% year on year.
Equity underwriting fees were down 35%, generally in line with the market but from a particularly strong prior year.
It was a low quarter in credit with lower volumes as clients were on the sidelines given the challenging market conditions.
Compensation expense was down 13%, with [inaudible] revenue ratio of 30% in the quarter, and non-compensation expense was up 14%, driven by higher legal expense, partially offset as we realized the expense benefits of business simplification.
However, the pipeline for the fourth quarter is solid and we still expect record gross IB revenues this year, exceeding $2 billion.
Loan balances were a record at $162 billion, up 13% year on year and 2% quarter on quarter, driven by continued outperformance in commercial real estate where quarter-on-quarter growth of 4% exceeded the industry across both multifamily and real estate banking.
Loans are the primary driver of nearly $250 million improvement in NII, and given market implied NIM and NII should be relatively flat in the fourth quarter.
First, you'll see we updated our adjusted expense target to $56-1/2 billion plus or minus for the full year, which is better than our previous guidance and would equate to the fourth quarter adjusted expense being relatively flat to the third.
We're expecting core loan growth of 15% plus or minus to continue in the fourth quarter.
Starting with business simplification which will drive a 2% decline year on year, in addition, we expect to see normal season of the clients in the fourth quarter versus the third.
But could we talk about what you're actually seeing in terms of where the financial markets are maybe drawing the line, meaning, are the deals that underwriting you expect to fall off in the fourth quarter based on your pipeline, is that a function of timing that you think could come back next year, are these marginal deals where markets are drawing the line?
My comments about the seasonality in the fourth quarter were most particularly towards markets revenues and less so towards the IB revenue space.
With respect to DCM, our sort of guidance there was that, you know, commentary really to the strength of the fourth quarter last year, and on relative basis, the pipeline is down.
Marianne, can you talk a little bit more about the card business and try to help us understand, the card revenue pressure that we saw this quarter into the fourth, how much of that is the NII side of things and how much of that is kind of the partner repricing, and how far past the fourth quarter do those resets continue before growth can overcome it?
And so it's really the fact that we're seeing that is going to come through in our revenue rate in the fourth quarter, which is going to push it down to below 12%.
I know your prior comments have focused on obviously always needing to invest, but in terms of just your focus as you think about next year and building the expense budget against the environment that we're seeing.
I think I said earlier that, adjusted, the consumer businesses in the three quarters so far are $700 million down year over year in expenses.
So, $700 million, if you adjust for legal expense in the consumer businesses, year to date we'll do some more in the fourth quarter.
I think, Marianne, you said it would be relatively flat in the fourth quarter, yet you're still expecting some pretty strong loan growth.
So with respect to the fourth quarter, we are expecting our loans to grow, and overall net-net sort of rotation of our cash and securities to loans would be supportive of NII.
And I'm just wondering, how should we think about how much is left on the consumer side over the next several quarters, especially given the 23% loan growth that we saw this quarter and your note saying that this momentum should continue?
Is there something going on there that we might see further improvement in the expense space in the mortgage side of the business in the fourth quarter or are we sort of -- are you at where you think you need to be in terms of the $1 billion to $1.1 billion a quarter in that business?
With respect to year over year, I do want to make this clear, with respect to the guidance year over year that we should expect non-interest revenue for the mortgage company in totality, to be down $250 million, that brings our total year-over-year NII [ph] down around $1 billion, maybe a little more, which is what we guided to at Investor Day. And it's more off the back of lower repurchase reserve releases, lower gains on Ginnie Mae sales and [inaudible] against [ph] the, you know, sort of non-fee-based revenues that are to do with third-party UPB, as well as runoff in the UPB.
And the reserve-based lending, you basically take essentially current prices, you discount at a discount rate, you assume expenses, you have to really engineer your cores [ph] and things like that, and you see if you can make -- roll over the loan at a sound, call it 65% LTV, and we think it's pretty good.
So you are right that, at this kind of 2-1/2%, one of these base point levels in card, it does speak to the quality of the loans we're originating and the engagement with the customers, which is much more now about driving, yes, some NII, but really, really good spend and therefore lower credit quality.
",48.98,0.8224996
jpmc,q4,2015,"And in the quarter, we continued our trend of strong balance sheet, capital and expense discipline and exceeded targets.
Shifting to the full year's results, if you skip over Page 2, on Page 3, the firm earned record net income of $24.4 billion and record EPS of $6 a share and a return on tangible common equity of 13.5% on revenue of nearly $97 billion.
With obviously the biggest area of stress in wholesale being oil and gas, against, which we built about $550 million in reserves this year including $124 million this quarter.
And as the outlook for oil has weakened, we would expect to see some additional reserve build in 2016 but prices would need to remain at this level for an extended period for them to be significant.
The increase in NII reflects a mix shift to loans but also includes gains on certain securities and the impact of the rate move in December on this quarter's NII was not significant.
Looking forward to the first quarter, expect firm NII and NIM to be flat to up slightly on higher rates and mix, substantially offset by the absence of those security gains as well as normal seasonal day count.
However, for the full year, with the December rate hike alone so in a rate flat scenario, together with the loan growth that we have seen and expect, we would expect to deliver about $2 billion of incremental NII.
So the task ahead is to solidify this position, which we'll talk more about at Investor Day. But with reference to my earlier comments on redeploying balance sheet, a portion of this reduction will likely reverse in the near future.
The combined consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income on revenue of $11.2 billion and an ROE of 18% for the quarter.
CBB generated strong results for the quarter with net income of $968 million and an ROE of 32% on relatively flat revenue of $4.6 billion.
And excluding an $85 million gain on the sale of a branch, non-interest revenue was down 3% seasonally and up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher service fees and strong debit volume.
Overall net income was $266 million, originations in the quarter were $23 billion, down seasonally and we continued to add high-quality loans to our balance sheet, $16 billion for the quarter and totaling $70 billion for the full year.
For the full year, our non-interest revenue was down relative to 2014 by $1.2 billion brought in line with our guidance and that downward trend will continue.
Expense of $1.2 billion ticked up this quarter related to exiting the OCC's consent order but it was down 10% year-on-year as we continued to manage costs.
The first was a loss in the prior year of over $200 million that related to non-core portfolio exits and a gain we saw this quarter of about $160 million on the IPO of square.
And in terms of core performance, business drivers were strong and growth offset the impact of co-brand renewals on non-interest revenues while driving growth in NII.
Finally, on credit, in auto net charge-offs were 50 basis points and while higher, they were still below our long-term expectations and in card, the net charge-off rate was 242 basis points for the quarter, 251 for the year, and given our underwriting discipline, client selection and the improving economy we expect net charge-offs to stay at these levels in 2016.
With that backdrop, the markets businesses delivered $3.6 billion in revenue in line with our expectations and normal seasonal trends.
With respect to the first quarter, reflecting low levels of client activity we were light risk going into the year-end and inventory was low and so far our trading businesses are performing well.
For the first quarter, expect revenue to be approximately $900 million which includes seasonality.
The Commercial Bank generated net income of $550 million on revenue of $1.8 billion and an ROE of 15%.
We saw record average loan balances of $166 billion, up 14% year-on-year, with growth in Commercial Real Estate of 17% exceeding the industry as we continue to invest in this business and gain share.
Asset Management reported net income of $500 million with a 27% pretax margin and 21% ROE on revenue of $3 billion, down 5% year-on-year driven by lower performance fees in alternatives.
So in summary, a solid quarter and a record for the full year, both in terms of net income and EPS, which even on higher capital translates to a good return on tangible common equity of 13.5%.
So the way we do our reserves, just for context because I think it's important is obviously the oil price outlook is important and instructive and it's very clearly going to drive how we think about probabilities of default and loss given default [for certain] [ph] customers.
Oil, we said last quarter, if oil reached $30 a barrel, here we are and stayed there for call it 18 months, you could expect to see reserve builds of up to $750 million and that assessment hasn't fundamentally changed.
It just seems as though $124 million in additional provisions for oil and gas could be low, at least based on the one year forward prices for oil, which are still in the 30s and so my question's for Jamie.
So just the oil price decline and the decline in the forward curve that we saw towards into December and to the end of the year, that's the impact it had on our reserves.
Marianne, I was wondering if you could remind us where you are on your expense reduction targets in the consumer and the investment bank and how does that translate to some thoughts about the expected trajectory of total firm-wide expenses for this year?
I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about the benefits from rates as they come through, obviously your commentary that NII will be even flattish in the first quarter adjusted for day count and even with some securities gains in the numbers this quarter presumes that a nice helper from that first move.
We are seeing a nice lift associated with the rate hike in December across businesses as well as the continued benefit of the mix towards loans in our balance sheet, but we were flatted in our NII this quarter by $178 million on securities gains in CIO.
And remember, if not nothing in the year that we started the year thinking we would exit $100 billion of non-operating deposits and while there still could be some volatility in that number of course, we've almost doubled that or doubled that in fact.
I hate putting words in your mouth but what do you think the disconnect then is between what's going on in the markets versus what's going on in the trends in your business, both in terms of growth and forward-looking credit books.
So you gave us the -- I think you said $68 million of full year reserve build and you gave us the not significant if things stay where they are.
Although it is clear that net-net despite factors the faith and intention of the committee wasn't necessary to increase market risk capital across the industry, it will be higher but by how much it's really going to need to be sifted through and for that same reason, for both those same reasons, I'm sorry, for the reason that the rule has not been stable and there have been significant questions, many of which have been either addressed or partially addressed many I guess that have not.
And I was just hoping you can give a better sense, Marianne, just given some of your prepared remarks, as to how much of that incremental $50 billion reduction was a function of more proactive mitigation efforts, maybe even tied to the mitigation efforts that you guys had talked about which should presumably remain in the run rate versus balance sheet shrinkage that may be due to the risk loss environment that we're experiencing today.
But the bigger points on the RWA outlook is that we expect to be bound over the medium term by standardized and standardized is going to always have a neutral to upward pressure as we continue to grow these high quality loans.
So but having said that, our buffer has been pretty consistent at the 50 basis point level for a reasonable period of time and we'll update you on all of that at Investor Day. Plus -- well, it is CCAR I should say because as you know the first two quarters of this year, our capital distribution plans have already been approved.
The number at middle market lending, if I remember correctly, if you look at it by client, 60% of the revenues are not loan related.
Revenue was down 1% or $1.3 billion driven by non-core items, most notably by business simplification in the investment bank and also in private equity.
With net loan growth being more than offset by lower market risk, reductions in derivatives, as well as secured financing balances.
Expenses was down 3% year-on-year on lower headcount from branch efficiency and additionally client assets were up 2% and Business Banking average loan balances up 6%.
Total revenue of $1.7 billion increased 8% sequentially on strong loan growth as well as on higher MSR risk management.
While on auto, 2015 set a record for new car sales with strength in the fourth quarter continuing through December and we gained nearly 40 basis points of share year-over-year with the strength of our manufacturing partnerships driving growth.
In Fixed Income, rates markets were up given U.S. and ECB monetary policy actions offset by year-on-year declines in currencies in emerging markets as the strong dollar and emerging markets uncertainty being persisted as well as the commodities on reduced hedging and declines in credit on all those same things plus a number of single name corporate events.
Equities delivered solid results, flat excluding the exit of broker dealer services last year with strong performance in Europe being offset by lower deal flow in North America and Asia compared to a strong prior year.
Security services revenue was $933 million in line with guidance given the continued impact of lower emerging markets on asset based fees.
Revenue was up sequentially but relatively flat year-on-year with NII up 3% on higher loan balances despite spread compression offset by lower IB revenue from a strong quarter last year.
In C&I loans were up 11% largely driven by corporate client banking of on the back of several large transactions.
Finally, credit performance of the portfolio does remain strong with only 4 basis points of net charge-offs.
We saw mixed flows in the fourth quarter resulting in long-term net outflows of $9 billion with solid inflows in equities being more than offset by weakness in fixed income and the loss of select mandates.
We exceeded our targets on expense management, generating positive operating leverage and improving our adjusted overhead ratio by 2 percentage points.
Delivered strong core loan growth of 16%, materially changed the mix of our deposit base including growing retail deposits at 10% and made meaningful progress on our balance sheet, our G-SIB surcharge and capital levels.
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
If banks just completely pull out of markets every time something gets volatile and scary, you'll be sinking companies left and right.
Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Stuart Bernstein.
So considerably more modest, which is why if energy prices and general commodity weakness and stress stays where it is right now, even for an extended period we would think that the incremental reserves would be considerably more modest.
Can you kind of lay out how it's progressed relative to your expectations so far and also remind us how big the allocation of the reserve is against that and I guess not to lead the witness, but is that an area where things are trending early days better than expected and could provide some buffer against maybe anything else that happens on the C&I side?
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Clearly the progress surprise positively, getting down to 3.5%, I was just wondering how you guys are thinking about establishing minimum capital targets.
Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
I realize the bond market doesn't set bank loan pricing but just wondering if you've been able to reprice some of the wholesale customers or expect being able to do so.
Bank loan not reprice like the markets do.
I guess I wonder why like we saw pricing in the debt markets come in considerably over the last several years.
And then the follow-up question is obviously the FASB is coming out this quarter with the new loan loss reserve methodology, the current expected credit loss versus what we're using today.
Your last question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
Did that have any -- you guys had very good mortgage banking results.
",56.32,0.6710345
jpmc,q1,2016,"Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $5.5 billion, EPS of $1.35, and a return on tangible common equity of 12% on $24 billion of revenue; and despite the general market backdrop and energy, our results this quarter were quite good and pretty straightforward.
But we also experienced some charge-offs this quarter in these sectors totaling $48 million, which were already contemplated in the Investor Day guidance of up to $4.75 billion of charge-offs this year.
We told you that the first rate hike together with our strong loan growth would drive 2016 NII higher by $2 billion and the $700 million increase in net interest income year-over-year, that you see here, is in line with that.
Recall that we ended the year with very low levels of inventory and as expected, we did see that reverse with our spot balance sheet up $70 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting growth in deposits and an increase in trading assets and secured financing activity.
In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 4% year-on-year, reflecting that record deposit growth I mentioned, as well as higher account and transaction volumes and investment revenue up 4% despite the challenging environment.
In Banking, IB revenue was $1.2 billion, down 24% year-on-year, driven by lower equity and debt underwriting fees, but in line with the market which was down 27%.
In terms of the outlook, we expect a sequential decline in M&A to be more than offset by an increase in debt and equity underwriting if the recent market improvements continue.
Moving on to Markets, Markets revenue was $5.2 billion and was down 11% year on year, reflecting decent performance given the environment and especially in light of the strength in the first quarter of 2015, where we saw elevated client wallet and trading, particularly in January last year, particularly around the Swiss franc event.
And overall, I would characterize the quarter as seeing reasonably solid client activity, but given the market backdrop, it was more difficult to monetize flows.
And finally, expense of $4.8 billion was down 15% year on year, driven by lower performance-based compensation and lower legal expense, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter of 32%.
Excluding the impact of the sale of an asset this quarter, which contributed $150 million to the revenue number, adjusted revenue, AUM and client assets were down each generally in line with lower market.
On first read, there are no significant new provisions from the proposal that would change our position, which is that we've been a fiduciary for over 150 years and based on our current advisory business, we are confident in our ability to adjust and be successful.
For Asset Management, the first quarter revenues adjusted for the $150 million were a little over $2.8 billion.
And assuming relatively constructive markets, we would expect those revenues in the second quarter to be flat to up but to be less than $3 billion.
And obviously, expense will also be flat to up in line with those revenues on performance-based compensation.
In the Commercial Bank, we expect revenues will be up modestly on continued loan growth.
The upshot of which is we expect pre-provision net revenue for the Commercial Bank to be relatively in line with the first quarter.
We're expecting close to $100 million, and there were a couple of extra downgrades that came through in the quarter, and that kind of timing is going to happen.
With respect to draws, when I gave some sort of indicative guidance about what you might expect to see potentially in the rest of the year in terms of reserve builds, we do try to take into consideration the likelihood that we will see incremental draws.
And obviously, as we continue to watch the sort of cycle play out over the next several quarters and reevaluate some clients that may be experiencing stress, it's likely that we will see some more NPLs. But I gave you context around what we're expecting to see in terms of reserves, so they will go up, but not to numbers that I would consider to be large in the context of our wholesale portfolio.
And obviously, when we look at growth in CRE or the Commercial Real Estate businesses of 18%, it's an obvious question are you doing something different?
I would start with your opening comments that considering our liquidity you were surprised, this doesn't appear to be a statement about the adequacy obviously of JPMorgan's liquidity, which is very significant, as you know; but it's really about how we analyze and think about that at the material legal entity level and the inter-affiliate nature of how we fund our entity.
So as we think about the implications of this morning's announcement, it's around your planning and procedures as opposed to a likely impact on the business operations today and the results that you can generate.
So on the interest rate point, the comments are pretty consistent with what we said over time, which is we have the belief that the U.S. economy is continuing to move in the right direction, that the consumer is on solid footing and that despite the noise in the data and some of the volatility in the markets, global growth will continue, albeit at a moderate pace.
We are positioned for rising rates, as you know, and have been, but we also understand what the performance of the company looks like if there are no more rate rises or when we stress our portfolios in lots of different ways.
And I would just add that $5 billion plus of sales and trading in a quarter like this I'd look at it as good.
And then with respect to the sort of restructuring and whether that presents opportunities for us broadly defined, including in compensation for better performance, we pay for performance and we pay risk-adjusted returns, and we're not looking to try and make changes to what we've been very consistent about over time.
It's the first real securitization in a long time in a mortgage business where you do revenue risk-sharing, and I think it's quite good.
And just one more follow-up question on the living will, could you help us understand what you think the regulators meant in terms of if the remediation is not met by October 1 of this year that there could be more stringent prudential requirements?
So we talked about the fact that if there's no change in rates and if we continue to grow our loans we'd expect our NII to go up by $2 billion.
I think in our favor because of the easing that's still going on around the rest of the world and the sort of dovish Fed comments there has been a lower re-price just in the industry generally, so that's in our favor but Â and you know we're much more sensitive to the front-ended rate.
But on the positive side Â and on the positive side, Mortgage Banking just given where rates were over the quarter has sort of been positive relative to the central expectations when we did Investor Day. So those two things are worth noting, but we are seeing really quite good drivers in noninterest revenue drivers across the Consumer space generally in debit, investments, in fees and accounts in the sort of 4%-5% range and sometimes in the range higher than that.
So obviously, as you look at their performance for the quarter, our fees have been impacted by lower asset levels, and we also have got the tail impact of some business simplification just getting the tail of that out of their performance.
You've obviously done a fantastic job on the cost base, but one of the issues that strikes me is clearly with the reduced revenues, particularly in the capital markets business, your comp down about $400 million compared to the first quarter or the quarter of last year.
We pay for performance, and I think we did a good job in the first quarter.
Consumers remain on solid footing leading to robust growth in business drivers and strong financial performance.
The wholesale businesses performed in line or better than expectations expressed at Investor Day and delivered decent financial results in challenging markets with significant volatility and global macro uncertainty.
The firm's results included one significant item, $773 million of wholesale credit costs, of which $529 million related to Oil & Gas reserves and $162 million related to Metals & Mining reserves, which were generally in line with our guidance.
While oil prices have improved somewhat in March, they do remain near historically low levels and the market is not expecting the recovery to be strong.
We also monitor for contagion and aside from experiencing a couple of name-specific issues in very closely related companies and observing some general stress in oil regions, we are not seeing anything broad-based and would not expect losses to be significant.
Noninterest revenue was down $1.5 billion year-on-year primarily driven by the market environment in both the Corporate & Investment Bank as well as Asset Management with the biggest drivers being lower IB fees and Fixed Income market's revenue in both case versus a very strong prior year.
Adjusted expense of $13.9 billion was down 2% year-on-year on lower performance-based compensation while continuing to self-fund incremental investments and growth.
Lastly, the Fed did not object to a $1.9 billion increase in our capital plan giving incremental capacity for repurchases next quarter.
CCB generated $2.5 billion of net income and an ROE of 19% with strength across all lines of business.
Mortgage revenue increased 7% on higher MSR risk management and strong loan growth, partially offset by lower servicing revenue.
Expense was down 2% year-on-year with an overhead ratio improving to 55% as we continue to make progress against our commitment, more than offsetting $200 million in incremental marketing and auto lease growth.
Lending revenue was down 31%, primarily reflecting mark-to-market changes on both hedges of accrual loans and securities received from restructuring.
So while investors have started to deploy cash and capital markets are wide open for well-understood names, there is still remaining caution for more challenging issuers.
Credit costs of $459 million were driven by reserve builds for Oil & Gas and Metals & Mining, as discussed earlier.
Revenue was up 4% year on year, driven by higher loan balances and deposit net interest income, offset by lower IB revenues versus a record last year.
Our Commercial Real Estate business continued to exceed the industry with growth of 18% year on year, reflecting superior execution while maintaining credit discipline.
Despite these lower markets, we saw positive long-term flows of $12 billion this quarter with strength in fixed income, multi-asset and alternative and including the benefit of a large mandate being partially offset by outflows in equity products given volatility.
So wrapping up, despite challenging market conditions, we delivered really quite good performance in the quarter with diversification allowing us to perform well in difficult environments and be there for our clients.
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Again, just based on our preliminary read, I think there's going to be significant work to meet the expectations of the regulators and our plan already had us doing a lot of work around actual real simplification of legal entities and other things.
Are there any changes in terms of underwriting metrics that your front line people are seeing since we are starting to see in certain markets like multifamily, which you guys have already identified have some weak spots, are there any other underwriting issues that are cropping up now that you didn't see three months ago or six months ago?
One, do you have any sense of whether your performance overall on really FICC represented market share gains or not this quarter?
But taking a step back, given that the delinquency statistics outside of energy still remain fairly stable, could you give us an outlook for how you think credit quality trends will play out for the rest of the year if the base case is slow growth in the U.S.?
It is absolutely the case that as you look at the resolution process that there are provisions that talk about if a remediation is not satisfactory with or cured within a two-year period, there is a possibility that the regulators could jointly decide and may jointly decide to take other actions that could include capital or liquidity or leverage or operating model discussions.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. If I look at the first quarter net interest income, which was at least better than what I had, good NIM and think about your full-year outlook, if I take it literally, it implies flattish net interest income dollars from here.

Good morning, Marianne, a quick question on NIM here.
Marianne, can you comment on what competitive conditions are like in the credit card market currently and if there has been any change around the intensity of competition for co-brand and rewards?
Your next question comes to line of Paul Miller with FBR.
Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay.
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities.
Maybe just as a follow-up, which is vaguely related, could I just ask, what you talked earlier about where there's a question earlier about competition and picking up market share which indeed you clearly have.

jpmc,q2,2016,"Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $1.55 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on $25.2 billion of revenue, a strong result this quarter, particularly given the backdrop.
And that strength was driven by increased client trading activity across markets and an improvement in IB fees compared to the first quarter, as well as strong core loan growth of 16% reflecting good demand across both consumer and wholesale and record consumer deposit growth, up $54 billion.
Second on Brexit, uncertainty running up to the referendum led to a risk off environment and following the decision, the markets were quite volatile as expected and volumes were materially higher in the immediate aftermath.
With respect to next steps, as you know, the ultimate relationship between the U.K. and the European Union broadly and access to the single market and possible things specifically will likely unfold slowly and over an extended period, depending on when Article 50 is invoked.
For the full year, expect NII to be up more than the $2 billion we guided at Investor Day despite headwinds from a flatter yield curve, given our sensitivity is significantly skewed to the front end of the curve and as industry deposit re-price to-date has remained low coupled with continued strong loan and deposit growth.
Revenue of $11.5 billion included some non-core items, which contributed a little under $200 million, principally a one-time gain on Visa Europe and negative mark-to-market on Square.
Consumer and business banking revenue was up 3%, reflecting strong deposit and account growth.
Mortgage revenue was up 5%, with rates remaining low, supporting production margins and on growth in NII of the added $14 billion of high-quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, partially offset by lower servicing revenue.
Expense was down to 3%, driven by lower legal expense and continued progress against our efficiency commitments allowing us to fund the incremental marketing and auto lease growth that we talked about at Investor Day. Finally, credit trends across the consumer businesses continued to be favorable with charge-offs in card trending up slightly.
So as the mix of our portfolio increasingly reflects these newer vintages, we do expect loss rates to continue to trend up but to do so slowly and as such, we built $250 million of reserve this quarter.
Our credit performance is in line with expectations and we have built $50 million in reserve this quarter, largely reflecting volume growth.
In banking, IB revenue was $1.5 billion, down 15% in a market down 18%, largely driven by lower equity underwriting fees.
We expect to see positive momentum in ECM as the new issuance market continues to improve and we expect DCM to be broadly in line with the first half, reflecting robust high-grade bond issuance offset by lower acquisition finance.
The positive momentum that we saw in March continued into the second quarter with strong performance in rates and currencies in emerging markets on higher client flows and performance also improved in credit and securitized products as client risk appetite recovered in a more stable environment, driving increased primary and secondary market activity.
Equities revenue was $1.6 billion, up 2% compared to a strong second quarter last year.
Revenue was up 4% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII and loan growth and expense of $731 million was up 4% reflecting continued investments in bankers and technology.
Finally, credit performance continues to be in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs of 14 basis points, driven by oil and gas but almost fully reserved and outside of energy, credit performance continued to be strong.
Revenue of $2.9 billion was down 7% year-on-year as we continue to fill the impact of weaker markets, lower performance fees and lower brokerage activity.
We had positive long-term flows of $3 billion as we continue to see strong net inflows in to our fixed income products with equity market weakness and volatility causing clients to derisk resulting in outflows in equity and multi-asset.
To reiterate, our firmwide guidance for the full year on each of revenues, expenses and charge-offs at this point is largely unchanged, obviously market dependent.
I know it's very early and it is probably limited in what you say, because you mentioned, it depends on the timeline of Brexit and how passporting works, but is there any kind of qualitative thoughts you can give us around the operational and/or legal issues we should be watching as this develops, legal entity, restructuring, net impacts of moving people versus lower cost geography, some things like that?
So the ROEs are at or above the portfolio ROEs. And with respect to auto, not to speak for others, but obviously, when you look at lower FICO scores and higher LTVs and longer terms on top of each other in an environment where you have already seen used car prices soften some and they are likely to continue to do so, it's something to watch.
And so we have been very, very thoughtful about that, not just today but as we been going through the cycle and not only on an absolute basis do we compare favorably in terms of LTVs and FICO scores and even terms to the industry but we have been very, very careful and low percentage of subprime originations very, very careful about looking at those layered risks.
So nothing in our -- and remember for this year, I think the charge-off rate is going to be 40-ish basis points compared to a long run average of more like 60.
We added 4% core loans year-over-year in card and so naturally as the portfolio grows over time, you would expect to add to reserves.
And so there will be a little bit of rates impact too but again, as I say, with very accretive ROEs. So I would look forward and expect there to be some reserve adds over the course of the next several quarters on a combination of those factors, but for all the right reasons.
So my first question is, given how well JPMorgan did on the fee car relative to last year's results and it seems like RWA and SLR exposure have stabilized over the past few quarters, how comfortable are you perhaps allocating more balance sheet to the investment bank, given that you seem to be very well positioned to continue to gain market share, especially end markets?
One, on the outlook page, I see on the printed page, it's the same as what you had last quarter for the company overall, obviously, but I heard the emphasis on NII was on the plus side, right, $2 billion year-on-year plus.
It looks like rates will be flat at least in the front end at this point, at least for the majority of the year, if not the whole year.
But you have seen already in the first two quarters that year-over-year we are up $1.4 billion, so we were doing better now on a combination of lower deposit bases, re-prices and also on strong loan growth.
So we would expect our NII to be between $2 billion to $2.5 billion, up year-on-year, largely strong loan growth, lower re-price.
Rates flat from here, so with the tenure of about 1.5 and IOER at 50 basis points, because of the loan growth notwithstanding any long end pressure, we would still expect year-over-year our NII next year to be up between $1 and $1.5 billion.
I wanted to ask a question on the cost side of things where the overhead ratios, both in the CIB and the consumer bank dropped really materially quarter-over-quarter.
I think the most important thing is that we will continue in every single country to serve our clients, day in and day out and if it costs a little bit extra, so be it.
Volatility is reasonably subdued at this point and I think because there are no event calendars out there right now, there is still quite a lot of opportunity in the, sorry, obviously DCM low rates would be a tailwind notwithstanding the M&A in ECM landscape.
It will ultimately honestly depend on the opportunities we see in front of us to continue to invest and to add customers and I think we are at a very good run rate of investments.
So starting with the qualification that obviously as you suggested, it's going to the market dependent, but also remembering that we knew when we gave guidance that we would expect the second half to be seasonally lower.
So you may recall that we said we would expect mortgage revenues to be down year-on-year actually by a reasonably significant amount given obviously where the rate environment is as well as some positive MSR results in the first half of the year, we would expect mortgage revenues to be more like flat.
And I know you can't really discuss too much on the legal side, but is it the right way to think about legal expenses going forward, like an ordinary cost of doing business for a bank of your size?
Marianne, I was wondering just if you could, I know it's a little backward looking now and you have made your points already about what normal trading seasonality could be, but can you help us understand the products that drove the really strong fixed trading?
Look, it's anyone's guess and I think you can go back and look over time, but last year we had a weak second quarter, as I said and we didn't see as much seasonality.
You pointed to, it's going to be at the higher end of the range for the year.
We are seeing the refi nexus go up very high and any outlook on where you think the mortgage market is going to be in the next quarter or two?
Within this, charge-offs of $150 million were principally driven by oil and gas and metals and mining and those charge-offs were very substantially offset by reserve releases, so they were previously reserved which means underlying the net $50 million reserve build we saw incremental reserve actions this quarter of about $200 million principally one energy name downgraded in the CIB.
The market functioned quite well absorbing the volatility and despite significant increases in volumes our systems were stable and we continue to support client activity with decent trading performance.
The improvement in both ratios was driven by net capital generation with RWA remaining relatively flat.
Firm SLR remained flat to the prior quarter at 6.6% as capital generation was offset by balance sheet growth.
Consumer and community banking generated $2.7 billion of net income with an ROE of 20%, reflecting continued strength in business drivers.
We added nearly two million households year-on-year with an increase of 700,000 since last quarter reflecting strong acquisition trends including the launch of Freedom Unlimited.
This quarter that we ranked number two globally and grew share by 50 basis points.
We continued to rank number one globally growing share by 30 basis points and we ranked number one in every product category for the first half of this year.
Credit costs of $235 million were driven by reserve build for oil and gas.
Commercial real estate loans grew 18% reflecting continued outperformance in both commercial term lending and real estate banking and C&I loans were up 9% on increased origination activity in both corporate client banking and middle market.
Comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.
Yes. And these loans are coming on at higher risk adjusted margins.
Yes. So NIM just naturally is down a few basis points.

jpmc,q3,2016,"Starting on page one and taking a look at the quarter, we had strong performance in each of our businesses despite the continuation of reasonably challenging conditions.
Highlights of the quarter include the highest reported revenue for third quarter in the CIB with IB fees up 15% and markets revenues up 33%, with strong performance across the board, robust core loan growth for the Company of 15% on the back of sustained demand across businesses, and the continuation of strong credit performance including a net release for oil and gas.
On the back of continued strong growth in core loans, net interest income was up $700 million and is trending for the full year to be above the $2.5 billion guided last quarter.
Adjusted expense of $14.5 billion was up $500 million, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by two notable expense items in consumer, which IÂll talk about later, as well as the increase in FDIC surcharge which took effect this quarter and some higher marketing expense.
Credit cost of $1.3 billion in the quarter includes consumer reserve build of $225 million, primarily card, but against that we have a net reserve release in wholesale for oil and gas of about $50 million.
And while itÂs primarily driven by mortgage, we also saw 14% growth in auto, 9% in business banking and 7% in card loans.
Mortgage revenue was up 21% on higher MSR risk management but also on higher production margins and growth in NII as we continue to add high quality loans to our portfolio.
Looking forward, assuming strong demand for Sapphire Reserve through the fourth quarter, we would expect revenues for CCSA to be down about $200 million quarter-on-quarter on higher acquisition costs but it will clearly be dependent on the number of new accounts originated.
In cards, we built $200 million of reserve this quarter, reflecting growth in the portfolio including newer vintages which have a higher loss rate than the portfolio average, consistent with our discussion during the second quarter and consistent with how we underwrite the loans.
Total revenues of CIB of $9.5 billion, up 16% year-on-year was the best reported performance for a third quarter and included the highest IB fees on record for third quarter too, up 15% with strong market performance across the board, revenues up 33%.
Coupled with solid credit performance, including a modest reserve build for oil and gas here, the business delivered a pretty clean $2.9 billion of net income and a 17% ROE this quarter.
Revenue of $3 billion was up 5% year-on-year, driven primarily by strong banking results on higher loan and deposit spreads.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, expect net interest income to be up modestly quarter-on-quarter on continued strength in loan growth, even as we digest the incremental cost of resolution based liquidity actions, which will be pulling in our run rate in the fourth quarter.
Finally, expect adjusted expense in the fourth quarter to be flat year-on-year, bringing full year expense in at approximately $56 billion consistent with our guidance and self funding the consumer items I mentioned.
And while as a Company, we are proud of this quarterÂs performance and in particular proud of the growth in the underlying business drivers, we take a long-term disciplined view and remain focused on delivering excellent customer experience, strong execution, particularly in risk management and expenses so that we can continue to deliver best-in-class performance.
So, we may have gained some share, certainly, hopefully the momentum in terms of the business weÂve been building in the way we are serving our clients, will serve us in that capacity, not just this quarter but through time.
So, I donÂt know Glenn if you recall, we had a bit of discussion about this last quarter and sort of guided to the fact that we would expect to see our loss rates go up slowly, I mean partly because obviously 250ish basis points, I think we could call that pretty low historically.
And so, as you look forward for us over the course for the next several quarters and we would expect those phenomena to generally continue again slowly, weÂre growing our portfolio, weÂre going to see the seasoning of those vintages as the mix increases and as they become more seasoned, cause us to build a reserve but for the right reason.
Marianne, just wondering, you mentioned that part of the increase in consumer cost this quarter was planned investments and that youÂre continuing to self fund.
I am just wondering as you think forward and we get past this good gear that youÂve had, will that be kind of underlying expectation for you guys, again with the understanding that the revenue environment will always take things up or down; but do you have an aspiration that you can continue to keep costs flat?
But based upon the speech moving to a baseline minimum standard is more consistent with how we think about our capital management policy and using the capital stack add-up using our G-SIB Score and our stress drawdown, actually you would come out with a sort of capital constraint on the CCAR thatÂs pretty much on top of our regulatory capital minimum.
So, first of all, based upon last yearÂs results for us, we are at the flow for the stress floor for the stress capital buffer, not to suggest by the way that we wouldnÂt continue to want to properly understand and better understand how we can through time make sure that we are performing the best we can on the stress within our risk appetite.
WeÂve built $25 million of reserve this quarter for auto and we expect to continue.
One of the questions weÂve been getting from a lot of folks is because this SEB is calculated based on stress losses year-to-year and historically CCAR results have been pretty volatile, I am wondering how you are thinking about the appropriate management cushion or buffer above the minimum.
Our spot balance sheet closed a little over $2.5 trillion, principally a result of strong deposit growth, as well as liability action taken to raise liquidity in the context of resolution, which also drove up liquid assets.
Card, commerce solutions and auto revenue was down 1% as a strong momentum in card and auto volumes and balance growth was offset by higher card origination cost and the remaining impact of co-brand renegotiations.
Underlying this expense performance is an incremental investment of $250 million in marketing and auto lease growth which is in line with investor day guidance and largely self-funded with expense efficiency.
Rates was a standout in terms of performance this quarter as markets stayed active post Brexit with good client flow, as well as anticipation of an uncertainty around central bank actions.
And credit and securitized products came back from a weak prior period with a recovery in the energy sector and central bank actions motivating clients to put money to work, producing a much more constructive market making and new issuance environment resulting in a particularly strong quarter.
Equities revenue was up 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year with Asia matching last yearÂs strong performance and strength in North America flow derivatives offsetting weakness in cash volume.
Commercial banking reported record net income of $778 million on revenue of $1.9 billion and an ROE of 18%.
CRE loans grew 19%, reflecting strong originations in both commercial term lending and real estate banking.
Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 10 basis points, roughly half of which was driven by oil and gas.
Outside of energy, credit quality is good and the commercial real estate portfolio had no net charge-offs during the quarter.
We saw positive long-term flows of $19 billion with strength in multi assets including the benefit of a large mandate this quarter, as well as inflows and alternatives in fixed income, partially offset by outflows in equity products.
Expect non-interest revenues to be down quarter-on-quarter based upon our current outlook for IB fees and assuming flat year-on-year markets revenues, also including higher card acquisition costs and seasonally lower mortgages.
Just one follow-up if I could get a just a high level comment on has anything materially changed in terms of rate or curve sensitivity as you remix the portfolio and as youÂre getting all this great loan growth?
We obviously did get some good inflows, liquidity flows in terms of money market reform into our government funds but we also have been very focused in our other wholesale businesses on continuing to attract operating deposits.
Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America.
You pointed out that about three quarters of your credit card acquisitions organic growth coming through mobile channels or digital channels I should say.

jpmc,q4,2016,"So starting on page 1, we had a strong end to the year, with record net income for a fourth quarter of $6.7 billion, EPS of $1.71, and return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of $24.3 billion, reflecting strong performance broadly across our businesses in a more constructive environment.
In addition, markets revenue was the highest on record for a fourth quarter, up 24% year-on-year, and credit performance remains, strong with net reserve releases across both consumer and wholesale.
Revenue of $24.3 billion was up $600 million or 2% year-on-year, driven by net interest income on the back of continued strong loan growth, as well as the impact of higher rates.
Adjusted expense for the year came in at $56 billion as expected, and our adjusted overhead ratio improved to 57%, as we continued to execute on and near the end of our strategic cost programs in CCB and CIB, as well as self-funding incremental investments in growth of nearly $1 billion year-on-year.
Another outstanding quarter in commercial banking, with net income of $687 million, record revenue of $2 billion, and an ROE of 16%.
Looking forward to the first quarter, expect net interest income for the Firm to be up modestly, reflecting impact of the December rate hike, as well as continued loan growth.
So I wouldn't call it a deceleration per se, but know it is a little bit lower so I think going into 2017 our expectation is that we would continue to grow loans strongly but possibly at the lower end of that range rather than the higher and of course, to a degree it will depend upon our mortgage portfolio but we intend to continue to add to that too, so sitting here today I'd say more high single 10% plus or minus and we'll give you more updates at Investor Day. Betsy Graseck
I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the forward look NII up a bit but also expenses up a bit and I just wanted to understand is that because you've got the opportunity to reinvest in things that you haven't been able to and if you could just speak to what caned of time frame the reinvestment will yield returns because the question I've gotten from people is why aren't you dropping the NII benefit to the bottom line here.
Volumes, transactions, everything is growing very strongly and although we still have some work to do to finish the large expense programs we're near the end of that, so just generally speaking, we're continuing to invest in the businesses and we'll see the improvement in our expenses flatten out and start to grow with volumes and that would also support growth in non-interest revenue outside obviously as the card phenomenon we talked to you about.
Now obviously we need to continue to that but we are very encouraged by not only the excitement in our customer base but also the way that the trends are performing in terms of spend and engagement, but when we introduce a new product we intentionally introduce a very exciting premium promo and its intended to generate excitement and I think you would agree it did, so we're delighted with the response that we've had and we've actually kept it up for longer than we initially expected but it's normal for us to come down from those intro rates as the product becomes more mature and that's what we are doing but to be very clear about our expectations of the performance of the card even at 100,000 points.
So I think in the conference in November, Kevin Waters said that as we look at the new products and we look at them growing coming out in 2016 and into 2017, we would expect the card revenue rate for the year next year to be about 10.5% after which as the cards and their accounts season and drive revenue growth we should see that continue to trend back up to a level in the past.
I mean, I think that it's actual detail of Retail spend, auto sales, house prices, household formation, confidence numbers, so I'm not basing it on the market just based if you look at a broad range of things that looks like growth may have gotten a little bit better in the fourth quarter plus if you take a walk around the world, Japan is doing a little better, Europe is doing better in fact one of the IMF came out yesterday and both global growth will tic up next year so it's just those factors.
And maybe just if we give you a bit of insight into the philosophy about how we do our investment and expense budgeting when we talk to our businesses, regardless to Jamie's point about necessarily whether the external factors are moving, the question is what do we want to do in terms of products and services and technology and bankers and offices that we can execute on well and responsibly and that is typically what defines us not our appetite to investor dollars, so I think we've told you pretty consistently that and you've seen it we added 130 net new bankers, we opened eight offices in the commercial bank, we're investing in technology very, very broadly, payments, digital across the Company so I would say that we don't feel like we've been held back in terms of our appetite to invest because of concern around the economy and in the same way, a more confident outlook in the economy won't step change that but we will continue to look for great investments everywhere we can and make them.
Obviously your peers and a lot of investors have been growing in their optimism for this you're in terms of animal spirits and everything else and just want to get a sense of how you're thinking about it do you share that optimism and any commentary on how we can think about both banking and trading into the New Year with all of the moving parts that we have around policy, etc.
So I would say just if we separate the two and just talk for one second about banking, you know fundamentals for a solid M&A year are there and obviously there will be puts and takes depending on what happens in the policy and reforms space, but we're optimistic about a solid M&A market but with the continuing trend of fewer mega deals but nevertheless good flow.
So yes, Matt it does include the benefit of higher long en rates and if you get the Q an get our disclosure on net income risk you'll get math that looks similar to that $1.5 billion or more, and then with respect of sensitivity from here, clearly it's not linear, so you can see if we just look at the Third Quarter, the first hundred basis points this is an illustration of $2.8 billion, 200 basis points of 4.5 so as we clip away, 25 basis points a time or $2.8 billion will start to come down and so that's broadly the outlook.
And actually my follow-up question, on the size of the balance sheet you did talk about loan growth of about 10% this year, if you look full year 16 versus 15 the balance sheet or the earning assets only rose 1% so maybe tie that into as you think about duration, the fact that you're sitting on a lot of liquidity and cash and how we should think about both overall growth in the balance sheet and then potentially some more remixing.
Yes, so what you saw happen in 2016 was not only obviously a rotation from securities and deploying deposits into loans but also we took a very large amount of non-operating deposits out of the balance sheet in 2016 so that is having an impact but we would expect to continue to grow our loans to grow our deposits strongly to manage the overall balance sheet through our investment securities portfolio and from here, if everything continues to be as the market implies we should see margin expansion.
Yes, so answer is across the metals and mining and energy, we have a little over $1.5 billion of reserves and there is a normal level of reserves that we will have that would be a large chunk of that and as you saw in 2016, we did take charge-offs of a little less than $300 million, so we will continue to likely see on a name specific basis as people work through their business models that there will be more charge-offs but ultimately if anything stays stable or improves, and of course we have to see that be somewhat sustained and find its way flowing through the financial statements of our clients then as we upgrade them god willing then we will see more reserve releases but it's going to take some time and we'll start to see that think about the large reserves we took.
We took them at the tail end of 15 and into 2016 we'll start to see new financial data from our clients, we'll start to do the borrowing base redeterminations and look at the impact of prices on reserves in the Spring so we'll start getting data this year so we may see more releases but it's going to come through over time.
Yes, I would say that when I talk about the overall core loan growth going down still being strong, it does reflect the fact that we've been seeing very strong outperformance in our growth over the course of the last couple of years particularly in commercial term lending and while we continue to believe there's great opportunities there, they will be lower so we've been printing in the teens pretty consistently and I would say it will be less and maybe more in the high single-digits but we will keep you updated.
Remember we don't run the business next quarter next month, because Assets Under Management are going up and these corporations are going up, fixed income mortgage will go up, need for FX goes up and needs for hedges go up so over time we know there's a cyclical increase and we try to estimate how much is cyclical and there will be a flip side of that and I think you might have gotten to the end of the secular cyclical decline.
I'd tell you compared to the targets that they set we still have a few hundred million dollars to deliver them and Daniel will go through that at the Investor Day. To my mind, that was a product that's done particularly well this quarter but I was wondering looking forward how you see that performing whether it's supported by what's going on in yield curve or whether do you see that supported more by sort of like one off euphoria around election so maybe that might tail off a little bit and then just moving on from that, how do you view the opportunities for growth in your Capital Markets businesses, your CIB versus say your lending businesses.
And Marianne coming back to the investment portfolio, obviously you talked a little bit about the duration.
Just a quick question for you Marianne, in terms of the mortgage in the overall picture, I understand why you're talking about maybe 10% core loan growth rather than 15% more recently, but just within the residential mortgage portfolio, it looks like that slowed in the fourth quarter, third and fourth quarter from a midteens year-over-year rate to a low single-digit quarter-over-quarter rate.
I think there was a little bit of that in the fourth quarter, particularly relating to actively managed product.
Wouldn't that delay some activity for at least a couple quarters for people to kind of see where we are going to end up and see where tax rates are and see what we might get in deregulation that may change perspective on the long term opportunities, so just thought there might be a little pause here.
Highlights for the quarter included core loan growth of 12% with strength across businesses, continued double-digit consumer deposit growth, ending with deposits over $600 billion, and record card sales volume up 14% on continued strong momentum.
Non-interest revenue was flat year-on-year, with strength in markets offset by higher card new account acquisition costs.
Non-interest revenue remained flat year-on-year, reflecting strength in markets and funding card new account acquisitions, as well as lower asset management revenues.
Net capital generation for the quarter were a positive, included a 16 basis point impact of higher rates on investment securities AOCI.
Consumer and business banking revenue was up 4% on strong deposit growth, and mortgage revenue was relatively flat as higher production margins and volumes were offset by lower servicing revenue on lower balances.
Revenue of $3.1 billion was up 1% year-on-year, driven primarily by strong banking results on higher deposit NII and continued loan growth, predominantly offset by prior period asset disposals.

I think if you look at again, there's a lot of wood to be chopped and sausage to be made before tax reform gets done and some of these things are brand new and they've never been talked about or done before so you can read a lot of studies obviously for banks to run net interest income so it doesn't directly change how you look at it so for everybody else it affects complete industries differently.

Adjusted expense of $14.8 billion was up 7% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher compensation on increased revenue and higher auto lease depreciation.
Adjusted for the student lending write-down I just mentioned, credit cost of $1.1 billion will be down approximately $700 million year-on-year as higher charge-offs in card were offset by a wholesale net reserve release this quarter versus a sizeable build in the prior year.

Starting on page one, we are off to a good start this year with net income of $6.4 billion, EPS of $1.65, and the return on tangible common equity of 13% on revenue of $25.6 billion with the continuing momentum from last year driving strong performance across all of our businesses.
NII reflected the impact of higher rates and continued growth, and NII reflected higher CIB revenues, partially offset by card acquisition cost and lower MSR risk management.
Total assets returned to above $2.5 trillion, reflecting the continuation of strong deposit growth as well as our trading balance is normalizing from very low levels at the end of the year.
Revenue of $11 billion was down modestly; consumer and business banking revenue was up 8% on strong deposit growth and we are starting to see the long-awaited improvement in deposit margins.
Treasury services revenue of $981 million was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher rates and operating deposit growth.
Another excellent quarter in commercial banking, with the 15% ROE, revenue grew 12% year-on-year due to higher deposit, NII and continued loan growth, as well as a strong IB revenue up 34%, making this the third consecutive quarter of IB revenues of over $600 million.
In commercial real estate, we saw sequential growth of 3%, slightly ahead of the industry but below the pace of prior quarters, impacted both by higher rate, as well as a prudent approach to new originations given where we are in the cycle and maintaining discipline on risk adjusted returns.
I guess on the consumer side, in your retail banking area, are you seeing customers increasingly ask for higher rate in their deposit accounts or any activity where they are moving from kind of checking to savings and kind of early signs of pressure on deposit pricing?
And to be completely honest, weÂve been pretty consistent that we would not really have expected there to be much in terms of deposit re-price at absolute levels of rate that are still quite low.
So, I would just start by saying that the charge-off rates weÂre seeing are completely in line with our expectations and guidance that we gave you at Investor Day, both in terms of 2017 being below 3% and over the medium-term between 3 and 3.25.
So, all the reasons that we articulated, a combination of positive credit expansion that took place over the last couple of years and performance of those newer vintages is in line with our expectations and with high risk adjusted margins.
And I would suggest to you that we will defend that share, but the competition is back and healthy and you canÂt expect us to continue to gain share at those kinds of levels, we want to defend it, but itÂs a healthy competitive market right now.
I think weÂre very happy with the performance of the portfolio with the growth rate we are getting and our core card loans were up 9% year-over-year and was getting a lot of NII benefit from that.
I think your implied guidance of 4.5 billion higher than 2016 is now at the 500 million from where you were at the Investor Day. And then, just as a follow-up on that in terms of if we do -- the implied curve I think has about one more rate hike in June, if we were to get another one, realize the dot plot too and another one in September, would that be immaterial increase in that expectation or just incremental or just how do we think about that?
So, actually the impact of [indiscernible] is a bit more than $500 million, more than was at the Investor Day, and a lot of big numbers that are pretty reasonable.
And if we had another rate hike, it would likely be later in the year and ultimately have relatively modest impact on this year but obviously be important going forward.
I mean, we did have 8% growth year-on-year in C&I, weÂre just saying sequentially things are a bit quieter and there are whole bunch of reasons that could be driving that.
And just one quick follow-up just on the deal making side, M&A slowed a little bit, but IÂm assuming itÂs the same point, Jamie just in terms of pipelines and expectations that corporates have about transacting.
We do think once you get to a certain target, usually about 100 basis points of spread, you start to see a little bit more pricing pressure starting to kick-in, just like you were saying Jamie different productsÂ
So, as long as weÂre seeing double-digit kind of sequential annualized and year-over-year growth in deposits, that provides a little bit cover and the sense of what youÂre talking as well.
We may see a little bit more lag, just because weÂre still kind of continuing to get deposit growth?
Remember, you have to be very careful because if rates were higher, people do different things with their money, like CDs and then how they view the stock market, that money -- some of that is actually in this.
And with respect to Investor Day couple of years ago, lots of things have fundamental changed since then, but the ultimate conclusion hasnÂt, which is that we believe that there is significantly more value for our shareholders and as I said before, for the economy with this Company the way it is today than in some other forms.
Obviously there might be a rate impact; I think you talked about expectations quite a bit.
But one thing that seems to be a little bit unusual is that a lot of the commentary across many of the card issuers is for the expectations of losses to be higher in the first half than second half.
Marianne, let me start with the question on the net revenue rate in the card services business.
So, but fundamentally, if you go back, I think to a conference that Kevin Waters spoke at last year sometime in I think September, he said look, weÂre going to see the revenue rate be lower, about 10 and some for the couple of quarters, while we acquire all of these accounts.

jpmc,q2,2017,"Other notable items predominantly net result changes and legal expense were a small net negative this quarter, so underlying adjusted performance was really strong and highlights of the quarter include average core loan growth of 8% year-on-year, reflecting continued growth across products; double-digit consumer deposit growth; strong card sales, up 15%; and Merchant volume up 12%; number one, global IB fees up 10% and we delivered record net income in both Commercial Banking and in Asset & Wealth Management.
With lower fixed income markets, mortgage and card revenue, all as guided being offset by strong fee revenue growth across remaining businesses.
Adjusted expense of $14.4 billion was up a little less than $400 million year-on-year with auto leases being the biggest driver, but also increasing the impact of the FDIC surcharge and broader growth being offset by lower compensation.
Anticipating you may have questions given the recent Gas & Oil prices, I would emphasize that we guided to expect reserve releases given we started the year with $1.5 billion of energy related reserves and with oil prices having found a lower but seemingly stable level we feel appropriately reserved.
You can see in the red circle on the page here that we ended the quarter with binding fully phased in CET 1 12.5% under the standardized approach with the improvement being primarily driven by capital generation offset by net loan growth.
We continue to grow core loans up 9% year-on-year driven by strength in mortgage up 12%, card and business banking were each up 8% and auto loans and leases were also up 8% driven by strong lease performance from our manufacturing partners.
Consumer & Business banking revenue was up 13% on both strong deposit growth and margin expansion.
With NII growth on higher loan balances and higher auto lease income predominantly offset by the continued impact of investments in card new account acquisitions.
Expense of $6.5 billion was up 8% year-on-year on higher auto lease depreciation, higher marketing expense and continued underlying business growth.
Net reserve builds were around $250 million building $350 million in card, $50 million in business banking and 25 million in auto, in part due to loan growth and in part higher loss rates in card.
With a strong market backdrop and supported valuations we saw continued momentum in global issuance especially IPOs. And debt underwriting fees were up 5% from a strong quarter last year driven by the high flow volume of repricing and refinancing activity even with fewer large acquisition financings.
Treasury Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 18% driven by higher rates as well as operating deposit growth.
Fixed income revenue was down 19% with decent performance across products relative to a very strong second quarter last year which was driven by higher levels of volatility and activity broadly, including as a result of Brexit.
Securities services revenue of $982 million was up 8% driven by higher rates and higher asset based fees on higher market levels and remember the second quarter benefits from dividend seasonality.
Revenue grew 15% driven by the deposit NII as the rate environment continues to be favorable and on higher loan balances with spreads remaining steady.
Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year driven primarily by higher market levels but also strong banking results on higher deposit NII.
But I think what this - what this makes me realize acutely is that no good deed ever goes unpunished and chasing our tails re-forecasting the full year NII every three quarters isnÂt as important or every quarter isnÂt as important as keeping our eye on the long term, which is nothing has changed, we are absolutely realizing the benefits we expected in the banking book assets and liabilities, and that means that our long-term projections will be good and the path is a little bit less important.
Yes. Can you just help us understand like how we turn the corner then on card income and your expectations for that going forward?
Yes. So obviously one of the biggest drivers over the last recent while in card revenues has been the extraordinary success we've had in capturing new Chase Sapphire Reserve accounts.
Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.
Moving on to Page 2 and some more details about the quarter, revenues of $26.4 billion was up $1.2 billion or 5% year-on-year with the increase predominantly in net interest income up approximately $900 million reflecting continued loan growth and the impact of higher rates.
Before I move on, I would also like to remind you that the third quarter of 2016 markets revenue was also a record since 2010, in fact it was about a billion dollars more than the average of the previous five years.
Starting with the quarter we guided second quarter NII to be up about $400 million from the third quarter given the rate hike, but you'll see that the NII deposits increased by only $150 million while we did fully realize the expected benefit of higher rate and continued growth, against that we had the one-time $75 million mortgage adjustment as well as lower CIB markets NII.
These effects together with modest downward pressure from lower tenure rate with all other things equal point to a full year number of closer to $4 billion up, while this is in the previous 4.5, but with the potential to be higher if we continue to benefit from tailwinds of lower deposit re-price.
So you will see, we have adjusted the guidance on the page, but it will be market dependent and any near-term forecast is sensitive to a number of factors none of which changes our conviction that we will ultimately deliver $11 billion plus of incremental NII as rates normalize and we are well on our way.
First, we are seeing slightly lower growth than we expected, coming into the year, it is only modestly lower and more importantly, we remain encouraged by the consistency and breadth of client demand across products.
During the quarter that Jamie had made a comment on potential disruptions related to the unwinding of the U.S. balance sheet, and I'm just curious, it's supposed to be slow and deliver, but I'm curious, how you think that impacts liquidity, the yield curve, trading, that participates in and is there anything you can do to protect JPMorgan against those disruptions?
ItÂs not something that we've seen before and so while it is the case that the Fed is communicating clearly and has every intention to make this gradual and predictable things can change and we should be prepared for that, not to say that that would have a particularly significant impact necessarily on JPMorgan, but that that would just be a downside risk, not a probability.
So that would ultimately slow growth not stock price and if we saw a $1.5 trillion come out of the Fed's balance sheet empirical evidence would suggest that we don't see dollar for dollar reduction in deposits.
The one tiny followup Marianne is I just want to make clear that the whole $4 billion versus $4.5 billion and you spelled out what happened in the quarter, it sounded like most of that full year guidance happened in this second quarter, but I just want to clarify that in terms of the second half NII, but do you think it's overly different from where we were a quarter ago?
If you think about a market making business where we can have assets altering of NII hedged by derivatives that ultimately have enough to NIR, we actually think about that in total revenue numbers, so there could be a little noise in there, but no I'm not expecting there to be significant changes.
Understood, okay and then my second question is, it was nice to see the card revenues on the fee side and the revenue capture rate moves towards the way you've been saying, it actually eclipsed the 10.5 you had said for the year already.
So at 10.5% revenue rate right now and with those having adjusted the premium with those originations stabilizing out into the second quarter, we will see ultimately will lap that impact a year from now and will see our revenue rates that are improving from here towards 11.25% that we sort of guided to in the medium term and we expect to get to that point all other things being equal kind of mid next year.
And of course that is one facet, weÂre also seeing significant momentum on the sales front, obviously as a result of those accounts we're growing core loans 8% and so we're having higher NII on those balances.
Hey two questions, one on M&A strategy, there was some discussion that maybe you were interested in acquiring something that's not really the question to comment on that specific rumor, but more in this regulatory environment and the changes that we've had already, do you feel like there is a little more flexibility for your strategic actions or outlook than maybe a year ago?
So just talk about what we've seen so far I think the industry has been really quite disciplined, which is what we would have expected at this early stage of a normalization in terms of the rate cycle.
And I would say with respect to deposit basis and the Fed balance sheet if we are right and we believe will be close to right and that we see the wholesale non-operating deposits flowing out of the system assuming everybody else has reached the same conclusion then it shouldnÂt really materially impact the liquidity position of financial institutions.
Yes, so whether it's because the operational risk will change or whether itÂs because the standardized rules become at least somewhat more risk sensitive there should be changes over time, but I think for the foreseeable future this is what we expect.
I think your loan book now is about $200 billion in commercial banking and can you just talk about some of the initiatives that you've discussed that the middle market the BIB, and how sustainable that is, and whether, how whether you're comfortable with the risk profile of the book you have there because you are growing quickly?
And then I would just say that in terms of how our clients are behaving and how the dialogue is going, whether you look at middle market, you Corporate Banking, M&A itÂs not to say that the possibilities of reform and the impacts that could have isn't a part of the dialogue, but they are fundamentally really just getting on with things and services.
So look, obviously you know the deal with CCAR people which is capacity is not necessarily a commitment to utilize it although we are as we fairly clearly articulated at our Investor Day and as you see in the numbers here, that we are at 12.5% in terms of our CET 1 and we believe we ought to be able to over time operate the company lower than that within the range of 11% to 12.5% albeit that we will take time to do that.
And that we pointed out two areas where it would have taken place, one is mortgages where regulators have held back lending to first-time buyers, immigrants, self-employed, buyer defaults, et cetera and the second is small business, whereas itÂs not existing small businesses, think of the start-up small businesses and that they are having a hard time getting capital maybe at community bank level et cetera.
I would just point you back to the fact that we have some 20 potentially binding constraints right now of which leveraging a variety of forms is part of that, so to the degree that we get the opportunity to recalibrate that, it could have impact on the margin, but we take all of those things into consideration when we think about the direction of travel of the company.
So when we think about the liquidity position of this company weÂre obviously managing not just regulatory requirements but also to what we will ultimate duration of equity and position of our balance sheet to be through the cycles.
Yes so I would, I would start by saying that a lot can change between now and the next cycle of CCAR or the next two cycles of CCAR and so we never did actually say that we necessarily wanted to get below into the range, but operate for the short to medium term within the range, while we let all of the potential changes to the sort of regulatory environment with large play out.
I wouldn't start imagining necessarily how low that goes, I think we would want to operate with sufficiency of capital and liquidity.
Yes and I mean, I would suggest although it's not something we tell you every quarter that we've been pretty forthcoming about showing you the level of our deposits and the split, at least Investor Day now and then between operating and non-operating deposits and as we start to see the impact of the Fed balance sheet unwind in the light, we will Â we will be very forthcoming.

jpmc,q3,2017,"Client investment assets, credit card sales and merchant volumes were all up 13%, and we continue to rank number one in global IDCs. We had record revenue in the commercial bank and delivered record net income and assets under management in assets and wealth management.
Revenue of $26.2 billion was up approximately $700 million or 3% year-on-year driven by net interest income up $1.2 billion, reflecting the impact of higher rates and continued loan growth, partially offset by lower markets revenue.
Treasury services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 15%, and while higher rates are a driver, we are also seeing positive momentum in organic growth in the business globally as our clients are responding favorably to the investments weÂve made in our platform and products.
Before I move on, the fourth quarter environment so far feels consistent with the second and third with no obvious catalysts on the horizon for that to change, but of course change it could, so itÂs worth pointing out that the fourth quarter last year was also a record for a fourth quarter since the crisis and as such, we expect next quarterÂs markets revenues to be lower year-on-year.
Moving to commercial banking on Page 6, another excellent quarter in this business with net income of $881 million with record revenue and an ROE of 17%, and although we recognize that our results are flattered by a benign credit environment, the performance is very strong and broad-based and is driven by the investments weÂve been making in the business, the differentiated path on capabilities we can offer our clients, and our commitment to business discipline.
Revenue grew 15% year-on-year driven by deposit NII and on higher loan balances with overall spreads remaining steady, and while IB revenue was down some year-on-year, we grew 9% sequentially with particular strength in middle market, which is starting to feel like a trend.
Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 6% year-on-year driven by higher market levels and by strong banking results on higher deposit NII.
Finally, turning to Page 9 and the outlook, all of NII, expense, charge-off and loan growth remain broadly in line with previous guidance, so to wrap up, this quarter and this year we continued to consistently deliver for our clients, our businesses are performing strongly across the board, maintaining or gaining share.
Could you just describe a little bit if this is just the start of an improvement in transfer pricing that the consumer banking division is benefiting from, and is there a lag that we should expect would continue to drive up this revenue lift over the next several quarters?
Yes, and the reality, Betsy, is that weÂve kind of operated over an extended period now on the presumption that while we happen to know about this breach, there will be others either right now that we donÂt know about or over time, and so we have to be proactive, not reactive, and weÂll obviously look to learn anything we can but we continue to evolve, so that we can use all of the information at our fingertips.
Yes, so look, obviously apart from the rate hike in June, nothing has really happened much since last quarter, and so the landscape is looking pretty similar, and not because thatÂs surprising, so IÂll come back to that in a second, which is to say that thereÂs been very little to no movement in the re-pricing of deposit accounts.
So at some point in time, and that may be a couple, three more rate hikes from now, the dynamics may start to change, and so we havenÂt changed our perspective about what we think the ultimate re-price will look like.
Then in the wholesale space, there is a spectrum as well, so I would start with weÂre firmly on a re-price journey in wholesale, no doubt, and depending on where you are in the spectrum it ranges from the smaller and lower middle market companies, where the re-price is modest but present, to the higher end where itÂs reasonably high.
If you look at the first four rate hikes of the previous normalization cycle, the overall cumulative deposit re-price was pretty much the same as it is now, so we continue to believe that the dynamics that weÂve been talking about over the last several years and that weÂve expected will play out.
I would also say one other thing about where we are right now, is that as you know, as much as youÂre right about the potential demand for the sort of high liquidity value deposits, thereÂs a lot of excess liquidity in the banking system and although loan growth is solid, itÂs solid, so we arenÂt seeing a frenzy, albeit that weÂre very proud of our deposit growth.
WeÂre doing a bit of all of the above, so IÂll start with the comment which you (indiscernible) before but which we still strongly defend, which is that branches still matter, that 75% of our growth in deposits came from customers who have been using our branches, that on average a customer comes into our branches multiple times in the quarter.
Yes, so as we look at the loss rates for this year, theyÂre coming in as we expected at less than 3%, and as we look out to next year, based on what we know today, itÂs still in that 3 to 3.25% range, albeit maybe at the higher end of that range, so itÂs broadly in line with our expectations.
The first is just to repeat the standard, just as a sort of macro matter, weÂre more sensitive to the short end of rates than to the long end of rates, particularly over any short period of time, so intra-quarter volatility in the 10-year, while itÂs not nothing, is unlikely to have a material impact on our run rate.
In terms of the loan growth, I think itÂs completely normal to see some moderation, and youÂre still doing reasonably better than the industry.
Okay, so on the first, I think it is quite important to not look at the average and to kind of decompose it into constituent parts, because weÂve talked before about the fact that we use our balance sheet strategically in the CIB, but loan growth is not really a thing there, and so this quarter we saw no loan growth in CIB, so no big deal, but it means that that 7.5% core growth for the whole portfolio would have been outside of CIB, closer to 9, so start with that.
Tax reform, so fiscal stimulus, the reality right now is although I think everyone, and ourselves included, are hopeful, obviously that tax reform is done for the right reasons and that the economy responds accordingly, at this point itÂs not front and center in the dialog weÂre having with our clients about whether they should or shouldnÂt do a strategic deal or take an action, so I would say it is neither holding up business nor spurring business, but that could change.
Yes, so we are--at this point, we are at that 3% charge-off rate, rising to 3 to 3.25 next year and growing, so you should continue to expect that weÂll be adding to reserves.
But yes, we do expect to hit the 11.25% in the first half of next year, and weÂve reached the inflection point end of the second quarter and into the third quarter where growth is offsetting the impact of the significant upfront investments in Sapphire reserve, so weÂll see revenues grow from here.
Following up, Marianne, on the commercial banking business, youÂve had--youÂve obviously had very good momentum there over the last couple years, and you did talk about credit dynamics and moderation in credit growth, and sort of a normalization back towards industry trends.
Yes, so IÂll just start with credit for a second, because although we absolutely expect at some point that weÂre going to see normalization of credit, we havenÂt seen that yet - I just want to make that clear.
I guess sort of a related question on the commercial banking business thatÂs a little bit of a follow-up as well on tax reform, obviously Congress--or the administration, House Ways and Congress released a blueprint so Congress can now start to flesh out a tax plan, and obviously thereÂs a lot of uncertainty as to the content, the timing - heck, whether it even happens or not.
YouÂve obviously continued to build cash, the securities book has shrunk - it makes sense give the flatter yield curve, but youÂve combined that with the still good deposit trends and the slowing loan growth, and obviously a challenge as you think about protecting them going forward.
Trust me when I tell you that you talk about excess liquidity because of LCR, and we are thinking about more than just LCR, and we do--as I said, while we do maintain a short position and the cost of being short is relatively cheap, we donÂt have the kind of capacity to invest $100 billion-plus in NBS right now, or anything thatÂs meaningful like that to generate higher returns without blowing through our duration targets.
I know you mentioned that loan yields are expected to be tight on competition, and I think (indiscernible), but have you had to go down market at all for loan growth?
Yes, so look, our card spend growth at 13% up year-on-year is still very strong, so when we say moderated, itÂs from very strong to very strong, and it is in part due to the number of new products weÂve had.
Clients are active with demand for credit remaining solid, all in all resulting in 7% growth in net income driven by positive operating leverage as revenue rises and expense remains controlled.
Consumer and business banking revenue was up 15% on higher NII, approximately equally due to margin expansion as well as strong average deposit growth.
Expect CCSA fourth quarter revenue to be relatively flat sequentially as higher net interest income will be offset by the anniversary net impact of Sapphire reserve last year.
Higher auto lease depreciation and continued underlying business growth were partially offset by lower marketing expense.
In general, it feels like the auto market has plateaued at current levels with inventory, incentives, used car prices and SAW all having stabilized over the last few months.
Securities services revenue of $1 billion was up 10% driven by rates and balances, with average deposits up 15% year-on-year as well as by higher asset-based fees on market levels globally.
This quarter, we saw net long term inflows of $21 billion with positive flows across fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives being partially offset by outflows in equity products.
We also saw net liquidity inflows of $5 billion and continued to increase our global market share.
Record AUM of $1.9 trillion and overall client assets of $2.7 trillion were up 10% and 9% respectively year-on-year on higher market levels globally, as well as net inflows.

All the other ratios as well as tangible book value per share also reflected a combination of $6.7 billion of capital distributions and the $3.6 billion impact of tax reform.
Consumer deposit growth was strong, up 7%, and we believe we are maintaining our sizable lead over the market despite an industry-wide slowdown, given rising rates.
Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 16% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion as well as strong average deposit growth.
Fixed income revenue was down 27% adjusted, principally driven by a tough prior year comparison and low volatility and tight credit spreads which have continued into this quarter.
And debt underwriting fees were up 12% as the market remained receptive to new issuance across high-grade and leveraged finance and refinancing activity was strong.
Client sentiment continues to be strong, supported by corporate tax reform.
For the quarter, we saw long-term net inflows of $30 billion with positive flows across all asset classes on continued strong long-term performance.
Record AUM of $2 trillion and overall client assets of $2.8 trillion were up 15% and 14%, respectively, year-on-year, reflecting higher market levels globally as well as net inflows.
So to wrap up, the end of 2017 was constructive, characterized by strong equity markets; higher interest rates; good economic data globally; decent client activity; high levels of confidence; and, obviously, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Adjusting for significant items in the year, net income and EPS would have been clear records, driving a healthy 13% return on tangible common equity.
Our first question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
So I think you'll see the capital markets space potentially react more quickly and I think loan growth may have a bit of a lag, but never say never.
Just looked like credit continues to be pretty good.
And then just consumer credit, broadly speaking, Auto has continued to look a little bit better and Card's still within reasonable expectations.
How are you guys just thinking about how the consumer behaves and what that means for both consumer loan growth and consumer credit?
Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.
Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of wells Fargo Security.
Our next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.
Was wondering how you're thinking about the credit environment heading into this year.
Yes. So 2018 feels like very strong credit performance in Consumer.
Or is your balance growth coming more from new customers?
Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Nomura Instinet.
So if you assume that the 2018 structure is much like 2017 with a nice healthy caveat that DTAs, DTLs and the impact of them can be volatile based on the scenario, so with that caveat, I would tell you that not carrying back NOLs has a very particular interplay with foreign tax credits, which means it's not really going to affect us in a meaningful way.
Marianne, assuming the economy in 2018, '19 accelerates due to this tax reform, I think it may imply that we would have higher interest rates and possibly a steeper yield curve.
Yes. I would say tax reform and a stronger growth outlook will solidify the path of rate hikes.
And if you think about something as first order as housing in high tax states, well, people are pretty situated where they live with their families and their jobs and higher income borrowers activity is less price-sensitive.
That's where real-time P2P has opened -- I think our bank has probably now like 30 or 40, it's been eventually.
The $2.4 billion impact of tax reform was largely driven by a deemed repatriation of our unremitted overseas earnings as well as an adjustment to the value of our tax-oriented investments, including affordable housing and energy.
It is true that we operate in competitive and transparent markets, and this means that ultimately, you could expect some of the benefit for the industry will be passed through to our customers over time.
And for certain of our businesses, pricing is not necessarily directly or immediately driven by fluctuations in the cost of capital, think flow markets.
Revenue of $25.5 billion was up $1.1 billion or 5% year-on-year as net interest income was up $1.3 billion, mainly reflecting the impact of higher rates and continued strong loan and deposit growth, partially offset by lower NII in Markets.
Adjusting for the two front-page significant items that we had this year, being tax reform this quarter and the benefit of the WaMu settlement in the second quarter, our net income would've been another record of $26.5 billion with an ROTCE of 13% and EPS of $6.87.
Revenue crossed back over the $100 billion threshold this year which feels good, $104 billion, up 5%, $4.1 billion of which was higher net interest income in line with guidance, benefiting from higher rates and growth, relatively modest deposit repricing, but pressured by lower Market NII.
We continued to grow core loans, up 8% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending, up 13%; and Business Banking, Card and Auto loans and leases were each up 6%.
And Card, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 11% year-on-year on higher Auto lease income, growth in Card loan balances and margins and lower net acquisition costs.
For the full year, Card revenue rate was 10.6%, in line with our guidance, and we still expect to reach 11.25% in the first half of this year.
Expense of $6.7 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher Auto lease depreciation and continued underlying business growth.
The overhead ratio was 55% for the quarter, 56% for the year as the business moved past the impact of investments and started generating positive operating leverage in the second half of '17.
In terms of credit reserve, the net $15 million build this quarter was driven by a $200 million build in Card on growth, offset by releases in Home Lending of $150 million and Auto of $35 million.
However, Fixed Income Markets included the net impact of tax reform on our tax-oriented investments which was approximately $260 million, accounting for 6% of the year-on-year Markets decline.
So in addition, although not in Markets revenues, $130 million of credit cost this quarter was driven by a reserve build related to that same name.
This quarter, IB revenue was $1.6 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by broad strength across capital markets.
In addition to higher rates, we continued to see organic growth within the business as the investments we've made over the past several years have improved our clients' experience across the platform.
Security Services revenues of $1 billion was up 14%, driven by rates and balances, with average deposits up 12% year-on-year, and higher asset-based fees on record AUC, given higher market levels globally.
I was another outstanding quarter for the Commercial Bank, with record net income of $957 million, record revenue of $2.4 billion and an ROE of 18%.
For the quarter, revenue included a benefit of a little over $100 million associated with tax reform and in our Community Development Banking business.
Even without this benefit, revenue would still be a record, up 14% year-on-year, on higher NII from higher rates as well as deposit and loan growth across businesses.
For the full year, we saw record IB revenue of $2.3 billion, up 2%, with particular strength in middle market, which was up over 50%, compensating for a smaller number of large deals.
Revenue was a record $3.4 billion this quarter, driven by higher management fees on growth in AUM as well as higher NII on deposits and loans.
So for guidance, expect the first quarter NII will be down modestly quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a combination of the lower gross ups I mentioned as well as normal day count which offset the benefits of higher rates and growth.
We do know that there will be puts and takes across our businesses, but in general, we would expect that the sort of certainty that people have been waiting for, coupled with the confidence that we know they've had, and the need for people to try and deliver growth to their shareholders, should mean that things that they were going to do become more compelling and they might be willing to do more.
And then half of the impact from the Tax Act in terms of tax equivalent adjustments is going to be felt in NIIs, that's sort of linear and equal, so that's another $150 million.
So -- but my expectation, just given where we are in the absolute level of rates is that on the retail space, we would still see a lot of discipline in the market in 2018.
But ultimately, we haven't changed our expectations that whatever that time line looks like, we're going to get to an overall reprice of above 50%, but we'll have to see.
So I'll just deal with the Card revenue rate real quick because I think we sort of gave a little bit of this in the third quarter, that given the Sapphire Reserve product and given the extraordinary success we had with that in the fourth quarter of 2016, there is an annual travel credit renewal that took place in the fourth quarter, which we already told you, which you would expect to see the revenue rate go down.
And as we lap the acquisition costs and reward costs associated with acquiring all of those Sapphire Reserve customers, and for that matter, our other new products, we're going to see that revenue rate get to the 11.25%, if not in the first quarter, in the first half of next year.
So again, it's nuanced, so what I expect though, the first question generally that we're getting is the impact on the housing market given certain specific changes in the tax code.
So Glenn, because I feel like in 2017, we spent so much time talking about year-over-year declines in comparable periods, it's helpful to, I think, that back -- remember the full performance for 2017 for fixed income and for equities and to markets in total.
And I know you kind of answered that, but so how much of that benefit -- I guess you paid $11 billion in taxes last year and that might have been under $7 billion with the lower rate.
And I do want to just -- like, there are two other things, just after what Jamie said, which is if some of this is competed away over time and get to lower cost of credit and lower cost of borrowing and improved pricing to our customers and allows them to grow their businesses and spend more strongly, there is a feedback loop.
So you, Marianne or Jamie, a year from now, do you think that the tax code or other factors will result in an increase in capital markets activity, increase in corporate lending and increase in CapEx, which we've been waiting for all decade?
I think if we're right about it in improving American competitive growth in the global economy, it will drive just capital markets activity.
Things looked good this quarter, for the full year, it came in line with your kind of $5 billion charge-off outlook.
So the two things that would change is your absolute level of losses would be higher as the tax rate is lower, against -- and so that would be a negative.
One of the businesses that has been doing extraordinarily -- extremely well in terms of growth and profitability momentum is the Commercial Banking business, and I feel like I ask this every quarter, but I guess the question is what you can do for an encore.
And so we've been investing 100 banks in a year for a period of time, opening offices, adding capabilities, focusing on digital, improving the customer experience just like in the rest of our businesses.
",56.63,0.84899855
jpmc,q1,2018,"Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $8.7 billion, EPS of $2.37, and a return on tangible common equity of 19% on revenue of $28.5 billion, benefiting from broad based strength in performance, but also lower taxes and seasonality.
So, this quarter's performance in context, on a core basis pretax earnings grew 13% year-on-year, benefiting from higher rate, solid growth across other revenue drivers, and continued investments in our businesses.
Included in the results, you see on the page, approximately $500 million of mark-to-market gains on certain investments previously held at cost due the adoption of a new accounting standard.
This impact which was also about $300 million for the quarter, reduced revenues, was split about 50/50 in NII versus NIR, an offset in tax expense.
Non-interest revenue was up $1.6 billion year-on-year and while it includes the mark-to-market gains on the first page, it also includes approximately $400 million of losses on investment securities and legacy private equity investments.
You'll see that our effective tax rate for the quarter ended a little above 18% compared to the 17% guidance we gave, driven by a combination of higher pretax earnings as well as geographical mix.
So, the reduction was driven by higher risk weighted assets reflecting the increased level of market activity, which similarly impacted all other ratios.
Client investment assets were up 13% year-on-year with half of the growth from net new money flows and with record flows this quarter.
And Card, Merchant Services, and Auto revenue was up 18% including higher Auto lease income, but it was driven by Card on lower net acquisition costs, higher loan balances as well as margin expansion.
Recall, last year included a net impact of a little over $200 million related to the student loan portfolio sale.
Equity underwriting fees were down 19% in a market that was also down and versus a strong first quarter last year, which included a number of large deals.
However, as mentioned, this includes the mark-to-market gains we called out on the front page and also includes a reduction of about $150 million reflecting lower tax equivalent adjustments year-on-year.
Treasury Services and Security Services revenue were both $1.1 billion for the quarter and up 14% and 16% respectively, driven by higher rates and balances.
So both, while client sentiment is high in the wake of corporate tax reform and we remain hopeful that this will support higher demand later in the year, we're not seeing that yet and we are maintaining pricing and credit discipline.
And while acknowledging the tailwinds of tax reform and higher rates, the consistent performance of business drivers is translating into topline growth and positive operating leverage with revenues and pretax income both up double-digits year-on-year.
Similarly, mark-to-markets as we talked about after the first quarter performance that's a driver and then as the ongoing sort of growth in the Auto lease income space which is significant.
Outside of that, you look at our underlying drivers across the Board in terms of new accounts and debit trends in Card sales and Asset Management fees as a driver too, so there's obviously a level of market dependency to it, but a bit of the sort of outsized year-on-year increase is seeing the -- somewhat tailwind of Card and market, both in the trading and in the Asset Management base.
Yes, I'll start with year-over-year, we're still getting significant benefits from our investment and expansion markets and also as you know we had a pretty -- we have a pretty unique sort of offering in terms of first term lending and so, for a period of time in both of those bases, we've been materially outperforming the market and so we're still seeing the benefit of that in our year-over-year numbers.
So, quarter-over-quarter what we're seeing is just the impact of the sort of overall industry-wide slowdown and the fact that you're right, it's not just pricing, it's just generally we continue to be very selective and cautious given where we are in the cycle, but we're not expecting flat for the year, we're expecting growth in the mid-single-digits for the year and we still believe that there should be demand.
So, generally across the -- sort of whole industry, I suspect the answer to the question is yes, but remember for us that we haven't been constrained by leverage -- Tier 1 leverage or SLR over the last -- over the last several years.
So, we gave you the stat -- that I think at Investor Day, we see more Card spend both debit and credit, but we also see higher deposits and investment, so digitally active customers.
I think our earnings at risk disclose at the end of last quarter was $1.7 billion, you go forward a quarter and that comes down a little less sort of realized rate benefit, but we've also seen as you know somewhere in the sort of mid 40s basis point increase in rates sort of front and long end which will also have a somewhat significant impact.
So, I would handpick and say of the increase more than half was related to volatility and obviously some of the volatility was somewhat significant, we wouldn't necessarily expect to see that level continue, albeit that we would expect to continue see periods or episodes of significant volatility and a bit less than half to do with positions principally, but not exclusively as a result of higher levels of client activity in the CIB any sort of balance sheet wants to go up and risk weighted assets and so on.
So, my first question to you Marianne is if the Stress Capital Buffer becomes final as proposed and now the industry has a BAU CET1 minimum that could move year-to-year, how does that change your outlook on how to think about dividends and buybacks from here?
Maybe just a question on the TCGA [ph], I know that we're all wondering if it's going to have an impact on loan growth, but what about credit, do you think that that has any positive impact, I guess, particularly on the Corporate side with higher cash flows going forward lower tax rate.
Yes, I would say across the Board actually all the way from full business to middle market, we're expecting sort of higher earnings more free cash and generally speaking, that would improve the sort of credit quality of the portfolio.
So, you're seeing that sort of relative impact of lower tax gross-ups and meaning portfolio and investment securities, if you were to adjust to that, they would have been up in line with rates.
First of all, last quarter was a -- this quarter last year, I'm sorry, was a record and so not that we don't always want to [Indiscernible] I still feel like we did pretty well and it's a little bit like the fixed income story last year, equity market in DCM was up and M&A was less strong in this year that turned around and I would say as we look at the results in ECM and DCM that were down, there were a few -- we were under indexed for the larger fee event for a combination of reasons; some outside of our control and some addressable and also some deals that we had hoped to have closed moved into the second quarter, which is all to say that actually if you look across the Board, M&A still look strong, DCM and ECM pipeline also looks strong.
Thank you operator and good morning everyone.
Adjusted expense of $16 billion was up 6% year-on-year, reflecting higher compensation expense as well as business growth including Auto lease depreciation.
Consumer charge offs were in line with expectations and guidance and there were no changes to reserves this quarter.
Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth.
Charge offs were driven by Card and were in line with guidance and there were no reserve actions taken this quarter.
IBCs were $1.7 billion, down 10% from a record quarter last year and strong performance in M&A was more than offset by lower debt and equity underwriting fees.
Fixed income market's adjusted revenue was flat versus a strong first quarter last year with rates and spread markets reversing to more normal levels following significant outperformance last year, being offset by strong emerging markets and commodities performance.
A well-diversified story driven by broad strength and continued momentum throughout the quarter with increased volatility benefiting all of equity derivatives.
Security Services also benefited from asset based fee growth on both market levels and new client activity.
Finally, credit performance continues to be very good with zero net charge offs this quarter.
For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $16 billion including $5 billion in active equities with strength across all regions benefiting from strong long-term performance.
Our first question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.

jpmc,q2,2018,"The strength this quarter was broad-based across businesses and highlights include average core loan growth excluding CIB of 7% year-on-year, consumer deposit growth of 5% which we believe continues to outpace the industry; card sales up 11%; and client investment assets and merchant processing volumes, each up 12%.
We maintained our number one rank in Global IB fees and CIB delivered double-digit revenue growth across the board.
Net interest income was up $1.1 billion or 9%, reflecting the impact of higher rates and loan growth, partially offset by lower market NII.
Net interest revenue was up over $600 million, driven by strong performance in markets and IB fees and also higher auto lease income.
The legal entity loss, together with the rewards liability adjustment in cards are the two notable items I mentioned at the beginning for a total reduction of over $500 million pre-tax.
Client investment assets were up 12% with more than half of the growth from net new money flows and we are capturing an outsized share as our customers shift from deposit to investments.
Consumer and business banking revenue was up 17% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion as well as deposit growth.
And cards merchant services and auto revenue was up 6% driven by lower card acquisition costs, higher card NII on margin expansion as well as loan growth, as well as higher auto lease volumes.
This was largely offset by lower net interchange, driven by a rewards liability adjustment of about $330 million, reflecting strong customer engagement across our Ultimate Rewards offering.
Fixed income markets revenue was up 12% adjusted on the back of good client flow and decent volatility and with commodities making a notable recovery from a challenging prior year.
It was a record second quarter for equities with revenue up 24%, driven by strong client activity and favorable trading results, and with particular strength in cash, prime and flow derivatives.
Treasury services and securities services revenues were each up 12%, driven by higher rates and deposit balances, and security services also benefited from higher asset-based fees on new client activity and higher market levels.
Another strong quarter for this business with net income of $1.1 billion and an ROE of 21%.
Gross IB revenue of $739 million was up 39%, driven by several large transactions and strong underlying flow of business and the overall pipeline is robust and active.
C&I loans were up 3% year-on-year and sequentially due to increased M&A related financing with strengths in our expansion markets as well as in specialized industries, and despite lower tax exempt activity.
Finally, credit performance remains strong with a net charge-off rate of 7 basis points.
Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 4% year-over-year driven by higher management fees on growth in long-term products as well as strong banking results.
Expense of $2.6 billion was up 6%, driven by continued investment in advisors and technology as well as higher external fees on revenue growth.
For the quarter, we saw net long-term inflows of $4 billion with positive flows across multi assets, equities and alternatives, partly offset by outflows in fixed income.
Although both revenue and expense are trending higher market-related, given weÂre only halfway through the year, weÂre not updating our outlook at this point.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
Consumer deposit up 5% year-on-year, slowing down as we would have expected, while you have seen online competitors and even some regional competitors make some moves in the large bank space, we havenÂt really seen that yet.
This quarter included one-time item, $174 million on the legal entity liquidation.
And our next question comes is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
Our next question is from Matt OÂConnor of Deutsche Bank.
Yes. So, linked quarter, reported down 2 basis points because of lower markets NII and higher market assets, $20 billion; core up 8 basis points.
Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $8.3 billion and EPS of $2.29 on revenue of $28.4 billion, all were record for the second quarter, even exceeding the benefit of tax reform.
Expense of $16 billion was up 8% year-on-year, with half of the increase directly related to incremental revenues, principally compensation in the CIB, transaction expenses and auto lease growth.
Core loans were up 7% year-on-year driven by home lending up 12%, business banking up 6%, card up 4%, and auto loans and leases also up 4%.
As a result, the card revenue rate was 10.4% for the quarter, but our full year guidance of approximately 11.25% holds.
In banking, we maintained our number one ranking for the quarter and year-to-date in Global IB fees and with a record first half performance, and we grew share across the regions.
We ranked number one globally as well as in North America and EMEA and gained share in a competitive environment, driven by IPOs and convertibles in the two most active sectors, healthcare and technology, which are areas of strength for us.
Total revenue was $5.4 billion, up 13% year-on-year or up 16% adjusting for the impact of tax reform and was driven by strong results in equities, solid performance across categories and with performance picking up in the second half of the quarter.
Revenue was a record for second quarter, up 11% year-on-year driven by higher deposit NII and strong investment banking activity.
But, the 11.25% for the year remains true, which is to say that while this may be slightly larger than normal, itÂs not exactly one-time item.
And in the retail also space for example, we talked about commercial real estate for example, mortgage clearly with capacity and the systems for example, all of those areas are pretty competitive for a variety of reasons given where we are in the cycle in the economy and like.
I wanted to ask you what you are seeing this quarter in terms of customer deposit trends, a little more color on both the pricing beta and volume balances.
So, weÂre going to continue to advance -- and itÂs got very high net promoter score by the way.
And so, I would characterize loan growth as solid and our expectations for the outlook to remain solid, benefitting from very active capital markets environment.
And maybe as a follow-up, when we think about NIM going forward, I mean, I think it was a couple of years ago that you talked about maybe normalized being somewhat the 265 to 275 range or 246 now.
But, we are on a core basis -- and remember, we have a fairly sizeable market balance sheet, but on a core basis we are continuing to see NIM expansion in line with expectations and moving up towards that.
And if you look at the proposal that was sent out for comments, not only did it have a large number of questions that they were asking the feedback on but their actual proposal was very similar to what we have been understanding was the intention in speeches that go back a fair way, which is to say that it feels like weÂre still making the sausage rather than this is a done deal.
And just my follow-up question is, the pushback that I am getting from a lot of investors on bank stocks is that we are long in the tooth in the economic cycle.
And I am wondering, both Jamie and Marianne, how you would respond to that pushback that now itÂs not the time to invest in banks because we are late in the game from an economic standpoint?
I think itÂs very easy that rates can go up, the 10-year rates can go up in a healthy environment.
So, while we still feel like that is our outlook at this point, we obviously are going to make the right decisions, based upon the environment that weÂre in.
As we look out for the full year, to the degree that we would be above our -- our outlook is $63 billion, it would be largely driven, if not exclusively driven, by higher performance-related compensation on higher revenues, with the only other caveat that as you probably know, we are waiting as IÂm sure you are for when the FDIC surcharge is taken away.
And if I could just ask a quick follow-up, and I apologize if you addressed it earlier, a lot of multitasking this morning, but on the market side, you did much better than what Daniel suggested in his update in terms of year-on-year being flattish overall.
Marianne, can you share with us, and correct me if IÂm wrong, I think you guys have given us some color in the past about the impact of the fed taking down their balance sheet over the next three to five years by a couple trillion dollars that it will impact your deposit side of the balance sheet.
ItÂs a little bit less credit terms but still pretty robust, albeit that we are seeing a tiny shift to the right in LTVs. WeÂre not going there, by the way, but I would call it pretty modest.
I think, itÂs good for the country, United States that we have a fully competitive field in card, mortgage, retail, asset management, commercial banking, investment banking, sales and trading.
While there were more catalysts this quarter, but you mentioned Italy, I think.
To follow up on the net interest margin, you mentioned ex the markets business it was still increasing.
But for us, the reason why itÂs pretty limited -- not to say thereÂs no other impact, but the reason why itÂll be mostly driven by the areas I mentioned is because in most of our wholesale space and so many of our other products, we are covered for multiple years, if not close to life of loan at this point.
But basically, itÂs still kind of what we expect over time.
",58.35,0.8108974
jpmc,q3,2018,"Record net income for third quarter even excluding the impact of tax reform with key drivers being higher net interest income across businesses reflecting continued rate normalization and solid growth in both loans and deposits, as well as very strong credit performance across all portfolios.
Highlights include, average core loan growth excluding the CIB up 6% year-on-year, card and debit sales as well as client investment assets and merchant processing volumes and consumer were all up double digits.
Noninterest revenue was up $425 million driven by market NII and higher auto lease income, partially offset by markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments.
Home lending revenue was down 16% as higher rates drive loan spread compression and the smaller markets pressuring production margins.
Card, merchant services, and auto revenue was up 10%, driven by higher card NII on margin expansion and loan growth, higher net card fees on lower acquisition costs predominately offset by lower net interchange and also on higher auto lease volumes.
Equity revenue was up 17%, reflecting continued share gains in cash and prime and strong performance in corporate derivatives.

Yes. IÂm just wondering, is the yield seeking-behavior youÂve seen so far consistent with your expectation, do you still expect to grow deposits as we look out for the next couple of years?
Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
Could you tell us a little bit more about the dynamics in terms of competition from non-banks, particularly in private middle market lending?
Yes. I wouldnÂt look at any one quarter when IÂm thinking about operating leverage, not to overplay seasonality or anything else.

The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Your next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
Net interest income was up $945 million or 7%, reflecting the impact of higher rate, net of lower market NII as well as loan and deposit growth.
Client investment assets were up 14% as we saw clear record net new money flows, more than doubling year-on-year, with flows accounting for more than half of the growth.
Consumer and business banking revenue up 18% on higher NII, driven by continued margin expansion and deposit growth.
For the quarter, IB revenue of $1.7 billion was flat to a strong prior year and we outperformed in a market of sound meaningful as we saw robust activity, particularly in ECM.
Treasury services and securities services revenue were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, up 12% and 5% year-on-year respectively, driven by higher rates and balances.
Revenue of $2.3 billion was up 6% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit NII.
On deposits, while we continue to benefit from the normalizing rate environment, as expected, balances are down year-on-year and bases are trending higher, as we are seeing some migration at the top end to higher yielding investments.
In C&I, demand remains muted in the wake of tax reform as well client confidence is high, balance sheet is strong and liquid, and the environment is competitive.
But if you decompose it, weÂre growing strongly in our expansion markets and specialized industries, growing solidly in our core markets, but are seeing notable offset in tax expense activity, given the mix of our business.
CRE loans were up 3% year-on-year, a little less than the industry as weÂre seeing increased competition and continue to be very selective.
Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher management fees, net of fee compression on higher market levels and continued growth in long-term products.
Expense of $2.6 billion was up 7%, driven by continued investments in advisors and technology, as well as high external fees on revenue growth.
The 10-year is up a modest 35 basis points since then and the world is freaking out that itÂs the end of the cycle and thatÂs going to choke off the recovery.
And B, IÂll ask again, is there a level of rates where you would start to see an impact of slowdown in what youÂre willing to lend rising in credit costs, things like that?
And so, from our vantage point weÂre not seeing anything in terms of looking at our current dialogue or for that matter at credit trends that would suggest that this is problematic.
With higher rates and we do this all the time, we obviously look at all of our portfolio and stress them for shocks of up 100 basis points even up 200, although clearly where we are now, risks are more asymmetric but -- I mean more symmetric.
And itÂs really just our effort to understand the long-term strategy, given that the pricing is quite competitive but at the same time, the marketing effort has been fairly minimal so far?
But, I wanted to understand how youÂre thinking about the impact on the outlook for your asset yields, in particular the securities portfolio.
But, largely speaking, for every rate hike weÂve been seeing on the front end, weÂre seeing our assets reprice about half of that and that -- or loans be priced about half of that and thatÂs what weÂd expect.
And IÂm wondering, given your fairly strong results across the board, where is the market wrong in terms of how theyÂre thinking about either the economy or bank revenues related to a strong economy?
Everything, given that growth outlook, is really sort of lining up for December rate hike and sort of more hikes into 2019 and the continuation hopefully of a steeper yield curve, and that all should be constructive for bank stocks.
It is definitely the case that as weÂve been talking about the years now, as the Fed is shrinking its balance sheet and liquidity is coming out of the system, yes, we are seeing deposit growth slow.
As we think about your wholesale loan trends year-over-year which continues to outpace the banking industry.
So, Marianne, look, I mean ROTCE of 17%, you seem to have some deposit market share gained, but year-over-year for the third quarter, expenses are up more than revenues.
So, expense number and investments, our expenses are up over a $1 billion year-on-year, in line outside of FDIC and revenue related costs, in line with the guidance we gave at the Investor Day. So, think about that sort of $2.7 billion of year-over-year investments, and weÂre working through it.
How do you -- but you guys still have a loan to deposit ratio thatÂs in sort of the mid-60s and youÂve been gaining share on the retail side.
So, thereÂs a lot of different investments and things to play which might make this kind of normalization cycle look a little different.
And so, the way we think about it is we look carefully across the spectrum of deposits, retail and wholesale at what we are seeing in terms of flows and balances and elasticity for our customers on our balance sheet.
But, weÂre going to carry on investing in technology, adding bankers, opening branches, launching new products so that weÂre defending the long-term growth and profitability of the Company.
And in the absence of giving you guidance, I would just point you to the fact that weÂre still targeting -- not targeting, but weÂre still expecting an overhead ratio to be around about the mid-50s over the medium term, which on revenue growth, implies weÂll continue to invest and there is also volume-related costs associated with that.
So, mortgage being a cyclical business as it is, we are, on higher rates, expecting the overall market to be down about 10% year-on-year.
So, IÂd say, on the margin point, itÂs been the case that for particularly in the sort of more liquid space, youÂve seen margins coming down consistently over the years.
So, when you run the business, you run the business to capture your share of that doubling, and of course, margins over time will come down, and the way you do it is being transformed by electronics, et cetera, but itÂs a pretty good future outlook.
So, as you know, weÂve been talking for a couple of years now about the fact that we did some targeted credit expansion in the card space a few years back.
My comment about the performance though is if we had looked at the 2018 card loss rate as we did at the beginning of the year, we said we would have expected it to be closer to 3.25%, but there are three things driving it to be slightly better.
So, a combination of factors have allowed us to deliver, apples to apples, a charge-off rate for the portfolio thatÂs a little better than we would have expected coming into the year.
And obviously, in this portfolio, as we go through the cycle, we would expect charge-off rates to continue to rise.
WeÂre very careful about how we think about residual risks and reserving on that portfolio, but itÂs very high quality growth.
So, obviously, we have a view of what we think the right return profile for these businesses should look like.
So, I donÂt know whether itÂs going to be high single digit or mid single digit growth year-on-year.
At this point, as we look forward over the near term, it feels like that kind of steady growth GDP plus, GDP is what weÂre going to get.
I will say one thing about markets, just to give you guys a tiny view, which I know you now, but just because of tax reform and another one-off item in the fourth quarter, flat year-on-year comparably would be up.
And that will be driven mainly by balance sheet growth, mix, and long end of rates.
",61.29,0.72920626
jpmc,q4,2018,"The increase is related to investments weÂre making in technology, marketing, real estate and front office, as well as revenue-related costs including growth in Auto.
Revenue of $111.5 billion is also record and was up nearly $7 billion or 7% year-on-year, $4.3 billion of which was higher net interest income on higher rates with growth and Card margin expansion being offset by lower markets NII.
At the end of the year, the adjusted expense was $63.3 billion, up 6%, which brings our overhead ratio to 57% for the year even as we continue to make very significant investments across the franchise.
For the quarter, core loans were up 5% year-on-year, driven by Home Lending up 8%, Card up 6% and Business Banking up 5%.
Card revenue rate was 11.6% for the quarter and 11.27% for the year as expected.
We ranked Number 1 for the year and the quarter and saw our leadership positions across all products globally with particular strength in IPOs as well as in the technology and healthcare sectors.
Revenue of $3.4 billion for the quarter was down 5% year-on-year with the impact of current market levels driving lower investment valuations and management fees as well as to a lesser extent, lower performance fees.
Expense of $2.6 billion was flat, as continued investments in advisors and in technology were offset by lower performance-based compensation and lower revenue-driven external fees.
For the quarter, we saw net long-term outflows of $3 billion with strength in fixed income more than offset by outflows from equity and multi-asset products.
Net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates and growth but quarter-over-quarter will be negatively impacted by day count.
So, to close, while the markets in the fourth quarter were more challenging, we should not lose sight to the fact that 2018 was a strong year, indeed a record for revenues, net income and EPS, both reported and adjusted for tax reform.
So, the way bank stocks have performed, clearly, investors are starting to worry about revenue trends near-term and of course credit, which you addressed.
IÂm wondering if the revenue trends continue to be weaker than expected, if the overhead ratio of 57% that you posted in Â17 and Â18 is something that you could continue to level off to, or will the investment horizon be more of a dominant factor when weÂre thinking about the overhead ratio.
But that said, we have -- while we donÂt set expense target, nor do we set overhead ratio targets, we have given you some outlook that would suggest that we continue to believe that combination of revenue growth and expense discipline, notwithstanding the investments that weÂve been making, we should see our overhead ratio continue to be stable to trending down to the kind of mid-50, so 55ish%.
And just as a follow-up question, the market is also thinking that the last rate hike from the Fed was December, and I'm wondering how we should think about the dynamics of net interest income and more specifically net interest margin and deposit pricing if December was indeed the last rate hike for some time.
So, if it is a pause because you are going to recession, youÂre going to do trades that obviously is very different than itÂs to pause, economy is strong and they raise rates, you know which one you would choose.
But over the course of the last couple of years as we've experienced that performance, we've done sort of surgical risk pullbacks, and we amended our collection strategy, all of which have led to a charge-off rate for the fourth quarter in Â18 that's down slightly year-on-year and for the year that's a 310 basis points which is reasonably meaningfully below our expectations, even as late as the end of last year.
So, we feel great that that kind of loss trends at that 310, maybe a little bit higher is something we should look forward to at least into 2019.
Just wondering on the markets commentary, obviously super early in the quarter, but you mentioned things feeling better.
And then, also in the fourth quarter, what you saw in leverage lending market, how much do you have to take in terms of maybe marks and leveraged loans and the hung deals?
So, I would say that obviously the fourth quarter was challenging and there was a lot of market moves, a big sort of broad set of.
And at that point, there were elevated concerns around trade, global growth data was causing concerns, there were concerns that the Fed was going to continue to be hawkish and not necessarily as responsive to some of the things the market was worried about.
So, yes, we could see slower growth but still growth in the U.S. and across the globe, a slightly more constructive narrative on trade and that continues to broadly progress we hope and believe in a positive direction, and a more dovish outlook from the Fed that potential for that to be pauses in rates or being relatively supportive.
ThatÂs not to say that there's no deal that has the potential for there to be net losses after fee, but nothing that we would consider to be significant and nothing in the fourth quarter.
I would also say that coming back to the first quarter that actually the market could be quite constructive to fixed income into the third quarter, given a more dovish Fed supporting corporate margin, corporate default rates are going to stay pretty low and we do have time.
So, itÂs no good of a conserve talking about how we think things are going to pan out in time in the first quarter other than just the general comment IÂve already made, which is the environment should be more constructive and weÂre expecting decent volatility in client activity and we will see how that pans out.
And we take the same division, we had strong first half of the year and we said long may it continue but it may not and one quarter doesnÂt make a trend.
So, in that role, what are you doing to help JPMorgan and I guess the other banks in terms of China, the government shutdown, immigration, some of these headline issues that Marianne talked about, having hurt the CIB in the fourth quarter?
And then, my follow-up question is that obviously that capital markets had a tough time but you are wholesale lending, the growth has accelerated quite nicely.
For us in fact, it was largely driven by one investment grade loan that we extended at the end of the quarter but there was a little bit of an uptick and a little bit more in terms of acquisition financing and the balance sheet but nothing I would call -- nothing that I would call unusual or a trend.
But as long as you feel as we do that the decision criteria that we use to determine the investments we're making which we think are strategically important for long-term growth of the company and the profitability of the company, supporting clients, if those are good decisions for long term growth, while we could obviously make changes, we would not look to do that.
We think it sort of differentiates our long term performance and we'd like to continue to do that.
I guess what I'm getting at is, last quarter you had modeled -- I guess what I'm getting at is like, it's -- are we at the point where like just a couple of lumpy loans was going to drive a few hundred million reserve build or is it just -- maybe it's a bit unusual still.
So, there is no doubt that as things continue, if there is a level of anxiety and uncertainty, itÂs just not constructive for confidence and confidence that gets stronger or less strong market.
And I suspect weÂll get more color at Investor Day but just want to get your sense of the sustainability of growth and you mentioned on the commercial side, you maybe scale back a little bit, maybe weÂre late cycle.
So, I think itÂs -- and incredibly nuance question, because in general, home lending has a challenging market backdrop.
So, there is a challenging market backdrop, card was doing well at and itÂs sort factor of all things we talked about, investments in digital product, rewards all of the above.
And in many of our businesses, weÂre going to protect profitability and credit discipline over growth at this point.
Similarly, something like auto lease where we grew our auto lease business, revenues and expenses strongly in 2018 and that will be in our run rate in the first quarter.
So, itÂs fair to say that money market rates traded above IOER throughout the fourth quarter and more pronounced at the end of the quarter.
We continue to have a bit of that mix shift in the first quarter and itÂs a market opportunity.
And then, a separate question on, I know itÂs not a big revenue driver anymore but within mortgage banking, you had a negative gain on sale in the quarter.
And at some point, we would expect both of those things to normalize but we would continue to see solid growth in all of our drivers.
And so, if you look at your at banking system, if you look at the leverage lending bridge book in Â07, it was over $400 billion; today's itÂs number like 80.
Starting on Page 1, the firm reported fourth quarter net income of $7.1 billion and EPS of $1.98 on revenue of nearly $27 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 14%.
Market impacts aside, underlying business drivers remain solid, increasing core loans and deposit growth, consumer sentiment and spending in a robust holiday season, faster market activity and the credit performance continuing to be very strong across businesses.
For the full year 2018, the firm reported revenue of $111.5 billion and net income was $32.5 billion, both clear records even adjusting for the impacts of tax reform.
Non-interest revenue was down slightly, with lower market levels impacting Asset Wealth Management fees and Private Equity losses being offset by higher Card fees and Auto lease growth in CCB.
Non-interest revenues was up $2.5 billion or 5%, driven by CIB Markets and growth in Consumer being offset by Private Equity losses and the impact of spread widening on FCA.
And although we are showing modest positive operating leverage on a managed basis, remember our revenues were impacted by lower growth in Cards given tax reform.
Adjusted for this or looking on a GAAP basis, we delivered nearly 200 basis points of positive operating leverage for the year and well over 100 basis points for the fourth quarter.
Credit costs were $4.9 billion, down 8% driven by lower net reserve build in Consumer as well as the impact in 2017 of student loan sales.
Risk-weighted assets decreased with loan growth more than offset by derivatives counterparty and trading RWA given a combination of seasonality, market conditions and all the enhancements.
Despite volatile markets, client investment assets were still up 3% and we saw record net new money flows for the year.
In Consumer & Business Banking revenue was up 18% on higher deposit NII driven by margin expansion.
And Cards, Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 14%, driven by higher Card NII, although loan growth and margin expansion, lower card, net acquisition costs, principally Sapphire Reserve and higher Auto lease volumes.
Expense of $7.1 billion was up 6%, driven by investments in technology and marketing and Auto lease appreciation partly offset by lower FDIC charges and other expense efficiencies.
On Credit, net charge-offs was down $18 million as modestly higher charge-offs in Card were more than offset by lower charge-offs in Auto and Home Lending.
We maintained our number one brand rank for the year and continued to hold strongly lead-left positions in high-yield bonds and leveraged loans.
Total revenue was $3.2 billion, down 6% reported and down 11% adjusted for the impact of tax reform and Steinhoff margin loan loss last year.
A confluence of factors throughout the quarter including trade, concerns around global growth and corporate earnings, fears of lower mortgage fares as well as other negative headlines caused spikes in volatility which were amplified by markets that assets and liquidity.
And although we saw decent client flow, rates rallied, spreads widened and energy prices fell significantly, all against general market conviction that was anticipating a stronger end to the year.
Weaker performance across rates, credit trading and commodities was partially offset by good momentum in emerging markets.
Treasury services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13%, driven by growth in operating deposits as well as higher rates but also benefitting from fee growth on higher volumes.
Underlying this was strong fee growth and a modest benefit from higher rates together being substantially offset by the impact of lower market levels and the business exit.
Full-year IB revenue was a record $2.5 billion, up 4% on strong activity across segments, in particular middle market banking which was up 8%.
Deposit balances were up 1% sequentially as client cash positions are seasonally highest toward year-end although down 7% year-on-year as we continue to see migration of non-operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives.
Underlying credit performance remains strong with credit costs at a $106 million including higher loan loss reserves, largely due to select client downgrades.
Other corporate saw a net loss of $752 million, including on a pre-tax basis funding our foundation for corporate philanthropy $200 million this quarter, flat year-on-year, and including a $150 million of markdown on certain legacy private equity investments market related.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
Yes. ThatÂs about public policy, thatÂs good for growth of America in total, and so very specifically stayed away from doing about banks there.
Last one, obviously markets all went down in the fourth quarter and we had some freeze-ups if you will in high yield first time in like 10 years.
And right now itÂs good, sentiment in consumer and we just got back some sentiment from I hope small middle market companies that while not at their high, but still very high.
Yes. Based on the prior conversation, it seems like 1Q might be in aberration of mid single digits or should I take that thatÂs kind of the run rate you are expecting for the full year?
Jamie, you did make a comment recently at investor conference talking about how the banking industry is over-earning on credit, not particularly a controversial remark.
I think, I hate to say this because I know that you don't want to wait a few weeks but we'll have a more complete conversation about kind of range of total outcomes on credit at Investor Day but we -- when we gave our medium-term simulation we said listen, we did a 17 return on tangible common equity in 2018 and our medium-term guidance is for 17%.
I think people in general have done a better job underwriting middle market and leveraged up than it did last time.
ItÂs causing changes in that banks now have options other than reserves at the central bank because the two-year and three-year bond yields for corporate -- government bond is much higher, some people are preferring to own that because they think it would be paid better than corporate risk.
Before Marianne answers that question, I just want to do a shout out to Jefferies because we actually look at what everyone does and every investment banking group, and you guys did a hell of a good job in healthcare this year.
And you know importantly if it really is the case that we have to upfront significant amounts of capital for longer term and lower credit quality loans I do really believe even though the cash flows and the economics, secular change, that you might find people less willing to lean into growth for longer duration assets if there are concerns around potential business.
",45.43,0.5926973
jpmc,q1,2019,"In the commercial bank we had record growth IB revenue, in asset and wealth management record AUM and client assets and the firm delivered another quarter of strong positive operating leverage.
Turning to page, two and talking into more detail about the third quarter, revenue of $29.9 billion was up $1.3 billion or 5% year-on-year, driven by net interest income which was up $1.1 billion or 8% on higher rates as well as balance sheet growth and mix.
Expense of $16.4 billion was up 2% relating to continued investments we are making in technology, real-estate, marketing and front office, partially offset by a reduction in FDIC fee charges of a little over $200 million.
Also in the page total assets are up over $100 billion quarter-on-quarter, basically driven by higher CIB trading assets in part and normalization from lower levels at the end of the year given market conditions.
Treasury services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year, benefitting from higher balances and payments volume, being partially offset by deposit margin compression.
Security services revenue was a $1 billion, down 4% as organic growth was more than offset by fee and deposit margin compression, lower market levels and the impact of the business exist.
Revenue of $2.3 billion was up 8% year-on-year on strong investment banking performance and higher deposit NII.
If we look across all of our hotel business, we also show strong growth year-on-year at about 8%, but there are three comments I would make; the first is that there can be reasonable noise in the fed weekly data; second, CIB is a big contributor for us, and CIB loan growth this quarter was supported by robust acquisition financing and higher market loans.
So while itÂs true that the Fed base was showing strong growth year-on-year and apples-to-apples ROE, in the domain stream middle market lending phase we are seeing good, mid-single digit demand in line with our expectation.
Revenue of $3.5 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as lower management fees on average market levels, as well as lower growth brokerage activity were offset by higher investment valuation gains.
Obviously a lot of the investments that we've been making in technology you know are also not only to do with customer service and risk management and revenue generation, but that also has to do with operating efficiency and we would also expect to start to see some of that drive, you know operating leverage.
Yeah, so I mean the first I would say is that you know, we probably said it before and weÂve seen these periods where you get kind of short term fluctuations in the curve is that, itÂs a big dangerous to chase it up and down every month or so.
So there is a little bit of pressure as a result of that, if it is persistent at this level throughout the year, but you know we continue to grow our loans and our deposits and against that, there is a mixed bag of lower for longer.
So while we may not have a tailwind of higher rates, we also may not have the same kinds of pressures that we would see on you know basis necessarily and while now longer and the rates maybe a net small drag in the short term on earnings, thatÂs a credit on the balance sheet and you could argue a patient FED and lower rates for longer may elongate the cycle.
I just Â I was hoping for a little bit more on the why, and to what degree does that reflect your build out of branches, how is that deposit growth going, how much of this is related to digital banking and then how much would be due to simply a perception that you have superior strength, I know that came up during the CEO hearing, the IMS study saying that you get a benefit due to a perception of being too big to fail?
So you record that we build a large number of branches following the financial crisis as we densified our position in new markets being California and Florida and Nevada and the like and so we do have a decent portion of our branches that are still in their maturation phase and so we are definitely seeing you know some growth in deposits there.
Year-over-year I would say you know we are see deposit growth grow exactly in line with our expectations, but this year the slowdowns speaks a little bit more as far as we can see to higher consumer spend and are little bit less to do with deposit flows out to rate-seeking alternatives.
What we are focused on is so both of these businesses that the long term growth opportunities are very big and the organic growth and the underlying businesses are performing well, and even with these revenue pressures we are focuses on continuing to drive efficiencies and these are good ROE businesses, you know above mid-teens.
Besides finding out Jamie's a capitalist, thatÂs shocking news, one of the risks that I think that the group talked about was in the private credit markets and non-bank lending and I just wanted to get a little qualifier of that Â I'm pretty sure you didn't mean the exposure JP Morgan has to those, itÂs just more risk being taken, but if you can just expand on that, that would be helpful.
The comments are really about the percentage of leverage lending or the percentage of some of our businesses that have now been taken outside of the banking market, and while you know we wouldn't say necessarily that that's systemic, being not systemic and suggesting that there won't be problems are two different things.
Net-net, it doesn't change our point of view that as we're at 12.1% CET1 right now, so arguably little bit above the high end of our range and continuing to grow earnings that we ought to be able to distribute a significant portion of earnings, but we always invest in our businesses first.
And then a separate question in the mortgage banking; it looks like gain on sale margins were at a high point as over the last five years this quarter.
My question is on the Treasury Services, year-on-year the growth going from double-digit you just grow to 3% where apparently the volumes remained healthy, but the margins started to deteriorate.
I just wanted to follow up on the net interest income, and it came in a lot better than expected this quarter.
Because if you annualize it, you're already above the full year target of $58 billion plus and obviously there's day count drag this quarter and really just puts and takes with rates and balance sheet growth, but it seems like the guidance is conservative versus where you're at right now.
You clearly seem more positive on the macro and obviously things can change there, but are you approaching from the balance sheet management a little bit differently, given may be more positive macro outlook?
It turns out that all the central banks are pointing to being a little bit more dovish, which couldn't generally be constructive for the environment and for credit risk on the balance sheet.
And so that's the environment that we look at to determine what's happening, and you know you've seen naturally over the course of the last couple of years as rates have been rising that we've seen flows of deposits to higher yielding alternatives, whether it's investments or whether it's more recently in CDs, and that may continue; we'll continue to watch that.
And my follow-up question is, we heard you loud and clear during your prepared remarks that the increase in wholesale non-accruals was idiosyncratic, and I'm wondering as we look at a tick-up in non-accrual loans in the Corporate & Investment Bank for the past two quarters, are we just in the part of the cycle where we're just growing from a low base or should we expect a step-down in the second quarter in non-accruals similar to how we saw last year?
Marianne just if I could ask you, you mentioned that there are some signs that the economy is strengthening, and I wanted to just ask you to Â can you split that between just what you're seeing on the consumer side versus the wholesale corporate side in terms of, the spend numbers are obviously still double-digit year-over-year, some others have talked about a little bit of a slowdown, you are just still saying quite good.
Yeah, I mean I think that as it relates to U.S. and in particular looking at the U.S. consumer, you've got all of jobs more recently, Auto, Housing, spend, all generally encouraging and holding up well and robust and whether it's double-digits or whether it's not, we're continuing to see that - and can see the confidence by the way, which is still very high and has recovered from any sort of hangout from the equity market actions over the four quarters.
We do still expect, as Dimon mentioned at Investor Day, that while we feel great about our positioning in investment banking in the first quarter.
First I want to ask as going to CCAR, now we're getting into that season again, one of the things that I think has an impact is that, what we had was a significant 30% plus growth in earnings last year.
So quarter-on-quarter Â and I think I mentioned a couple of these things, but across our businesses for a variety of reasons on an end-of-period basis loans are down.
But just underlying core business demand for bank balance sheet lending, you know I look at the middle-market space and say, we're still seeing solid demand.
We saw record client investment asset in consumer of over $300 billion and record new money flows this quarter, and double digit growth in both card sales and merchant processing volumes, up 10% and 13% respectively.
Non-interest revenue was up slightly as reported, but excluding fair value gains on the implementation of a new accounting standard last year, NII would have been up 5%, reflecting auto lease growth and strong investment banking fees and while market revenue was lower, there were other items more than offsetting.
RWA is up primarily due to high accounts cost of credit on trading activity, but notably this quarter being offset by lower loans across businesses on a spot basis.
Moving to Consumer & Community Banking on page four, CCB generated net income of $4 billion and an ROE of 30%, with consumers remaining strong and confident.
Revenues of $13.8 billion was up 9%; Consumer & Business Banking revenue up 15% on higher deposit NII driven by continued margin expansion; Home Lending revenue was down 11%, driven by net serving revenue on both lower operating revenue and MSR, but notably while volumes are down production revenue is up nicely year-on-year on disciplined pricing.
And product Merchant Services & Auto revenue was up 9% driven by higher Card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and higher auto lease volumes.
Fixed income markets revenue was down 8% adjusted, driven by lower activity, particularly in rates and in current fees and emerging markets, which normalized following a strong prior year.
Equities revenue was down 13% adjusted, seeking more to the record prior year quarter and this quarterÂs performance, which was still generally strong across products.
Finally, expense of $5.5 billion was down 4% driven by lower performance based compensation and lower FDIC charges, partially offset by continued investments in the business.
Finally credit costs of $90 million was predominantly driven by higher reserves from select client downgrades and net charge offs were only 2 basis points on strong underline performance.
Expense of $2.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year but continued investment in our business, as well other headcount related expenses were partially offset by lower external fees.
For the quarter we saw net long-term inflows of $10 billion with strength in fixed income, partially offset by outflows from other asset classes.
AUM of $2.1 trillion and overall client assets of $2.9 trillion were both records of 4% driven by cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long term products and with third quarter market performance nearly offsetting fourth quarter declines.
Underlying drives across our businesses continue to propel us forward and in March and coming into April the economic backdrop feels increasingly constructed, client sentiment has recovered and recent global data shows encouraging momentum.

About $100 billion of that is squarely within our existing buyback, so you can think of this as highly targeted to high quality existing customers, and for the first time, weÂre actually seeing loan growth in cards as the majority of it coming from existing customers versus new customers, and so weÂre really shifting the paradigm there and we feel great about being able to harvest the opportunity that we talked to you about at investor day.
And so, we continue to focus on optimizing the balance sheet across capital and liquidity and so looking at loan sales and thinking about de-risking the portfolio from a servicing perspective, so good quarter on the back of the rally but it doesnÂt change the overall structural challenges.
If we had to say what it is today for next year, itÂd be something like $11.5 billion, and I think itÂs always becoming more efficient, but what you really have in tech is some things are becoming cheaper all the time and then youÂre also investing money all the time, which weÂre going to do regardless of the environment, so weÂre not going to cut things weÂre trying to build, like My Rewards programs and Chase My Loan and the credit journey because thereÂs a recession or something like that.
ThatÂs right, and our investments in technology create capacity in terms of productivity to continue to invest, and we talked a lot about AI and machine learning - itÂs early innings there and thereÂs a lot that weÂre going to be able to do to invest there and become more productive, and then cloud, developers can become more productive using the cloud.
You mentioned You Invest, you look at our client investment assets grew 16%, a portion of that was You Invest, and obviously You Invest cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build, so youÂve got to put all those things in perspective about how you start making decisions going forward.
Those things may be a little bit higher now than normal, but what I think we see is global growth is north of 3%, you kind of expect the United States to be 2.5% this year.
Importantly, as we always say, loan growth is an outcome, not an input, and we feel good about the loan growth that weÂre seeing in terms of the areas where weÂre investing, and for the full year you can think about a number if you adjust for the loan sales and ex-CIB of 2% to 3% full year.
We are still seeing some migration from non-interest bearing to interest bearing, but largely weÂre seeing those balances stabilize, and then we do of course have continued growth in the consumer bank.
In other words, if we think about if the ongoing rate and curve environment persists into next year after the two or three cuts this year, are we looking at a billion or is it way too complex to over-simplify like that?
Just given the range of outcomes are as broad as they are, and importantly if weÂre looking at cuts that are insurance cuts that sustain the expansion versus cuts that may be in response to a broader economic slowdown, there are other things that we would be talking about, so weÂre not going to give further guidance on 2020 until we know more.
No one wants to, a, [indiscernible] terrorism or criminal activities, and thatÂs going to be true for everybody involved in this, and thatÂd be banks even doing [indiscernible] for a long period of time, and those [indiscernible] I think will just become for everybody at one point, and they should.
WeÂre always going to want to have a management buffer, because as I had said, our first priority will always be to invest and grow our businesses, and then of course there remains a lot of uncertainty in terms of the regulatory capital framework.
I just want to remind you all that the nine quarters after Lehman, the real stress event, we made $20 million to $30 million, and CCAR assumes youÂre going to grow your balance sheet, it assumes youÂre going to continue your dividend and stuff like that.
So right now, itÂs for bank wholesale use to have immediate information, we all have the same information, you can move things; but eventually, youÂll be able to move money quicker with data, so yes, weÂre optimistic about that and weÂre going to roll that out as soon as we can and constantly test it and make sure itÂs secure and all that.
YouÂve got to look at the problem youÂre trying to solve, but people legitimately said, well, you didnÂt have real time payments - that was true, and now we do effectively sell from P to P, and we do effectively [indiscernible] real-time payments in TCH, so we are building the things that the future is going to want - APIs, Blockchain ledgers that have much more data, real-time moving of money that also goes through floor checks, etc.
Always remember, thatÂs who weÂre here to serve, and someone is going to pay eventually for services provided, but people like their credit cards.
So weÂre going to take and give our clients more and better and faster and cheaper all the time, and now we package that with [indiscernible] banking and [indiscernible] card, or discounts on mortgages.
Are you considering that, because IÂm just thinking about where fintechÂs is trying to exploit you, and I know itÂs a catchphrase - under-banked, that is being used by [indiscernible], doesnÂt necessarily seem like itÂs solving anything for them, but maybe youÂve got a better solution that we just donÂt focus on.
Then we have a product, which really is great, called Secure Banking, and think of it as a card but itÂs the full thing.
I think thatÂs going now 25% or--and weÂve kind of pushed that a little bit more, so weÂre always trying [indiscernible].
But weÂre not going to change the way we run the company because of the rate environment, weÂre going to continue serving our clients, investing with discipline, and managing the balance sheet across all dimensions, that being capital, liquidity and duration.
Then in terms of expenses, again weÂre not going to change the way we run the company because of an interest rate environment, and IÂll just say again that the range of outcomes are very broad here and so if we end up with insurance cuts, itÂs a temporary headwind, and if we end up with cuts in response to a broader economic slowdown, there will be a lot more to talk about.
There are also huge opportunities to spend your money wisely, so the Sapphire card was birthed in Â09 and you could imagine that--you say okay, we have this great opportunity but weÂre not going to take it, and so I think youÂve got to be very careful.
As you know, itÂs over four quarters and so we have time to think about it, but obviously pleased to have the flexibility.
Underlying performance for the quarter was strong with highlights including client investment assets in consumer banking up 16%, largely driven by net new money flows; in card, 11% growth in sales and 8% growth in outstanding; number one in global IBCs year-to-date, gaining share across all products and regions; steady results in the commercial bank with net income of $1 billion while continuing to invest in the business; and in asset and wealth management, record long-term inflows, AUM and client assets.
ItÂs important to note here that these variances include the impact of loan sales in home lending as we continue to optimize our usage of capital and liquidity across the firm.
Credit performance remained strong across businesses and we delivered another quarter of positive operating leverage.
Excluding that variance and the other offsetting notable items I mentioned, non-interest revenue was about flat with strong performance in consumer across auto lease, home lending production, and consumer and business banking, offset by lower markets revenue and IBCs as previously guided.
Expenses of $16.3 billion were up 2% related to continued investments in our businesses partially offset by a reduction in FDIC charges of approximately $250 million.
In consumer, credit costs of $1.1 billion were flat as higher net charge-offs were offset by net reserve releases.
And in wholesale, credit performance remained favorable with a net charge-off rate of 8 basis points, which was fully reserved for in prior quarters.
Home lending was down 17%, although excluding the MSR adjustment I just mentioned, revenues would have been up 4% driven by higher net production revenue on better margins and higher volumes, largely offset by lower NII on spread compression and lower balances.
Excluding the previously noted rewards liability adjustment, revenue was up 11% driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion and the impact of higher auto lease volumes.
Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 4% driven by continued investments in the business and higher auto lease depreciation, largely offset by efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.
Fixed income markets were down 3% on an adjusted basis with relative weakness in EMEA partially offset by increased client activity in North America rates and agency mortgage trading, due to the changing rate environment.
Finally, expenses of $5.5 billion were up 2% compared to the prior year with higher legal expenses partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense.
Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 5% year-on-year predominantly driven by lower investment banking activity due to our outperformance last year and lower NII on slightly lower deposit balances.
Also worth noting here, gross IB revenue of $1.4 billion was up 8% year-to-date on strong syndicated lending and M&A advisory activity, and we continue to progress solidly toward our long-term $3 billion target.
The story here remains unchanged - we saw solid growth in areas where weÂve been investing, including expansion markets in specialized industries, offset by lower acquisition-related and short-term financing activities.
CRE loans were up 2% with modestly higher activity in commercial term lending, where clients are taking advantage of lower long-term rates, offset by declines in real estate banking where we continue to be selective, given where we are in the cycle.
Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 1% year-on-year as continued investments in advisors and technology were partially offset by lower distribution fees.
AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, both records, were up 7% driven by cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products, as well as higher market levels globally.
Revenue was $322 million, up $242 million year-on-year due to higher net interest income driven by higher rates and balance sheet mix, partially offset by net losses on legacy private equity investments versus net gains in the prior year.
I noticed that card loan growth was particularly strong this quarter.
Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
Just going back to JimÂs question, I noticed that investment securities balances continued to go up and mortgage loans were down another 5%.
Good morning, thanks for taking my questions.

jpmc,q3,2019,"Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.1 billion and EPS of $2.68 on record revenue of $30.1 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 18%.
Underlying performance continue to be strong with highlights including client investment assets in Consumer Banking, up 13%; strength in our consumer lending businesses, in particular on higher origination volume in Home Lending and Auto; and healthy growth in sales and outstandings in Card; number one in global IB fees year-to-date with over 9% wallet share and record growth IB revenues in middle market; and in Asset & Wealth Management, we saw record AUM and client assets.
Record revenue of $30.1 billion was up $2.2 billion or 8% year-on-year as net interest income was up $293 million or 2% on balance sheet growth and mix, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates.
Noninterest revenue was up $1.9 billion year-on-year or 14%, driven by strong performance across Fixed Income Markets and consumer lending, which included a gain on mortgage loan sales of approximately $350 million.
Expenses of $16.4 billion were up 5% on volume and revenue-related expenses as well as continued investments, partially offset by lower FDIC charges.
CCB generated net income of $4.3 billion and an ROE of 32% with continued deposit growth and total loans down 4% year-on-year.
In Consumer & Business Banking, we saw strong deposit and investment growth year-on-year with deposits up 3% and client investment assets up 13%, reflecting continued growth across both physical and digital channels.
Home Lending revenue was up 12% on higher production volumes and margins, partially offset by lower NII on lower balances, which were down 12%, reflecting loan sales.
With regards to these loan sales, it's important to note the net impact to Home Lending revenue is minimal with the gain on sale being offset by a funding charge from Corporate.
And in Card, Merchant Services & Auto, revenue was up 9%, driven by higher card NII on loan growth and margin expansion as well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes.
Expenses of $7.3 billion were up 4% year-on-year, driven by continued investments and higher auto lease depreciation, partially offset by expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.
This quarter, CCB had a net reserve build of $50 million, which included a build in card of $200 million, largely offset by releases of $100 million in Home Lending and $50 million in Business Banking.
It was a record third quarter for investment banking fees, driven by strong performances in debt and equity underwriting, partially offset by lower advisory.
However, the pipeline remains healthy as strategic dialogue with clients is constructive, equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the lower rate environment has made debt issuance more attractive.
This quarter was characterized by strong client activities across the board with outperformance in agency mortgage trading and improved flows in rates and commodities.
Equity derivatives performance was challenged by lower client activity and unfavorable market conditions, but prime remained strong and cash outperformed relative to the prior year.
Expenses of $5.3 billion were up 3% compared to the prior year with investments and higher revenue-related expenses partially offset by lower litigation and FDIC charges.
And finally, credit costs were $92 million, driven largely by reserve builds on select emerging market client downgrades.
Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year with lower NII, driven by lower deposit margin, partially offset by higher noninterest revenue due to strong investment banking performance.
Gross Investment Banking revenues were $700 million, up 20% year-on-year on increased M&A and equity underwriting activity, and we saw revenues increase for both large deals and flow business with a record quarter in middle market.
Expenses of $881 million were up 3% year-on-year as investments in the business were largely offset by lower FDIC charges.
And in CRE, although there was higher origination activity in Commercial Term Lending, it was largely offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle.
Finally, credit costs were $67 million with a net charge-off rate of 9 basis points.
Expenses of $2.6 billion were up 1% year-on-year on continued investments in technology and advisers, partially offset by lower distribution and legal fees.
Credit costs were $44 million, driven by net charge-offs as well as reserve builds on loan growth.
AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets was $3.1 trillion, both record, were up 8% and 7%, respectively, driven by cumulative net inflows into long-term and liquidity products as well as higher market levels.
Revenue was $692 million, up $795 million year-on-year, primarily due to higher net interest income driven by higher balances and balance sheet mix as well as the funding offset from the lower mortgage loan sale that I mentioned earlier, all of which was partially offset by lower rates.
Our next question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Could you give us a little bit more color on how you're expecting those dynamics to play out, particularly given slightly lower core loan growth this quarter and 22% increase in investment securities balances?
And even though the deposit margin is higher year-on-year, not surprisingly, it is down 13 basis points quarter-on-quarter given the current rate environment.
Investment Banking revenue of $1.9 billion was up 8% year-on-year in a market that was down.
And for both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, we ranked number one in wallet share for overall ECM and IPOs. We expect fourth quarter IBCs to be down both sequentially and year-on-year driven by strong performances in the third quarter and prior year.
Fixed Income Markets was up 25%, a good result, which also benefited from a comparison to a somewhat quiet quarter in the prior year.
Revenue of $3.6 billion for the quarter was flat year-on-year as the impact of higher average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were offset by deposit margin compression.
And curious if you think we need changes in the structure of the market to function better on a go-forward basis.
And I think it's up to the regulators to decide they want to recalibrate the kind of liquidity they expect us to keep in that account.
But I think the real issue when you think about it, is does that mean that we have bad markets because that's kind of hitting a red line in that checking account.
But in terms of 2020, the way I think you can think about it is we've given you full year 2019, which implies a fourth quarter just under $14 billion.
But the fourth quarter of '19 in terms of run rate is not a bad place to start.
I know, as of the end of June, it showed that you had bumped up into the next GSIB bucket, and I wanted to understand how you're thinking about managing that as we go into year-end.
Is there anything that you would be looking to doing to get there that might reduce your positioning in some of the businesses that you're involved in, for example, things like derivatives, et cetera?
As you think about the cross current of resolution planning, LCR, and liquidity stress testing, could you help us -- what is the level of excess deployable cash at JPMorgan?
And as my follow-up, Jen, if -- you said something about the offset to the 2 Fed cuts that are in the forward curve would be balance sheet growth and mix.
But in terms of balance sheet growth in 2020, you can think about largely in deposits.
In terms of investment securities, when you look at the increase this quarter, there's a few things going on.
So there's a few things going on in investment securities this quarter.
And we're a little bit higher than what we said earlier in September at Barclays, and that's because we got a little bit of a tailwind on the 10-year and some balanced growth and 1 less cut in December.
First of all, broadly speaking, on expenses, I would say we remain committed to what we said at Investor Day in terms of the cost curve flattening from here.
I'd like to just -- and then our call centers, Mike, we don't necessarily think about it just in terms of the number of people.
So on client sentiment, I think it's fair to say that perhaps the marginal investment is being impacted by trade fatigue in terms of the uncertainty.
And in fact, quarter-over-quarter, we saw rates paid in the consumer businesses tick up a little bit on slight migration that we continue to see into interest-bearing.
First, is if you look at the balance sheet, security yields came down pretty significantly this quarter.
Because I think we've pointed out, if you had built the securitizations, you have a healthy mortgage market, you keep some on them on your balance sheet.
But with all this mixing into your last point there about where the deposit margin pressure comes in, do you expect the constitution of deposit growth to change at all, whether it comes from the consumer business, wholesale or the Wealth Management complex?
Look, I think it's difficult to know.
So at Investor Day, we said that the card revenue rate would be 11 50%, plus or minus.
Just I just want to follow up on -- you talked about the fourth quarter net interest come just under $14 billion, and that's not a bad place to start for next year.
So I do think -- and so as a JPMorgan matter, we're going to grow our businesses and serve our clients as best we can whatever the environment is.

jpmc,q4,2019,"Starting on Page 1, the firm reported net income of $8.5 billion; EPS of $2.57 and revenue of $29.2 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 17%.
Deposit growth accelerated in the fourth quarter across consumer and wholesale with average balance up 7% year-over-year.
We saw solid loan growth with Card and AWM being the bright spots as average loans across the company were at 3% year-on-year excluding the impact of home lending loan sales in prior quarters.
And expenses of $55.5 billion were up 3% year-on-year driven by continued investments as well as volume and revenue related costs, partially offset by lower FDIC charges.
On the page is the CECL adoption impact, an overall net increase to the allowance for credit losses of $4.3 billion which is at the lower end of the range we've provided.
In the fourth quarter, CCB generated net income of $4.2 billion and an ROE of 31% with accelerating deposit growth of 5%.
For the full year, results in CCB were strong was $16.6 billion of net income, up 12% and an ROE of 31% on revenue of $65.9 billion, up 7%.
In Consumer and Business Banking, revenue was down 2% driven by deposit margin compression largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher noninterest revenue on the increasing client investment assets as well as accountant and transaction growth.
For the fourth quarter, CIB reported net incomes of $2.9 billion and an ROE of 14% on revenue of $9.5 billion, a strong finish to the year.
Total revenue was $5 billion, up 66% year-on-year driven by record fourth quarter revenue in both fixed income and equity markets.
Expenses at $5.2 billion were up 12% compared to the prior year with higher legal volume and revenue related expenses, as well as continued investments.
Fourth quarter revenue of $2.2 billion was down 3% year-on-year with lower deposit NII on lower margins largely offset by higher deposit fees and a gain on the strategic investment.
The CRE loans were up 1% where we continue to see higher origination in commercial term lending driven by the low rate environment, offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle.
Revenue of $3.7 billion for the quarter was up 8% year-on-year as the impact of higher investment valuation and average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were partially offset by deposit margin compression.
In fact, there from a rate paid perspective we continued in the fourth quarter to see rates pay pick up a little bit on migration from savings to CDs. And then on the wholesale side, we did see rates paid come down as you would expect and we could see betas accelerate after the second cut.
And then I would just say in terms of the outlook with the Fed on hold, the implies do still have one cut later in 2020 and based on the latest implies we'll give you more detail at Investor Day as we always do, but I would say NII for the full year of 2020 flat to slightly down as a headwind from rates will be offset with balance growth.
And so we saw sentiment improved a bit which I think contributed to the overall success of the fourth quarter and then certainly there are some puts and takes.
Obviously, labor market is very strong and the Fed and the ECB on hold and then capital spending is still a bit soft, but sentiment is at least certainly better than it was six months ago.
I guess on the provisioning side my question is more just on an ongoing basis is the mix changes more towards higher loss content lending which obviously have higher margins and higher profitability through the course --over the course of the loan in theory but like in that context I would --is it fair to say you're provisioning levels also could be materially above your charge-offs because I would think that your reserve ratios, your ALLL ratios do have to move up is that mix changes on your balance sheet.
And I think management had gave us in color that you'll continue to invest your efficiencies and initiatives no matter what the changes are in the revenue environment.
So, look, on the efficiency ratio, yes, I would say that like we've run the company with great discipline whether it's relentlessly pursuing expense efficiencies or investing with discipline through the cycle but because the efficiency ratio is an outcome not an input and is about expenses and revenue, we're not going to give a target for any one year.
We think about operating leverage over time and we always say we're not going to change the way we run the company for what could be temporary revenue headwinds.
Two questions, one on asset growth in the last couple of years fourth quarter, you have to go through this exercise of trying to squeeze down to hit the G-SIB target.
So we, I think we ended up at the low end as we through the year continue to get more certainty around what the macroeconomic forecasts were going to look like.
I guess first on expenses, full-year outlook was pretty clear less than 3% growth, but the first quarter seems a little bit higher than the maybe I would have thought up 4% year-over-year.
In the commercial bank, I mean you seen loans come down quarter-on-quarter for end of period and generally modest growth year-over-year.
So there are obviously some puts and takes which I'll run through but broadly speaking I would say what we're seeing is more a function of our own discipline than it is a function of demand and in C&I, we feel good about the growth that we're seeing in the areas where we're focused and specialized industries and market expansion, but of course that offsets partially by the tax-exempt portfolio that's running off and then in CRE good growth in commercial term lending as we continue to have opportunities there given the rate environment.
So obviously the bank has gained share but can you speak to future opportunities and runway and maybe this is more of a question for Investor Day, but specifically businesses like cash management, transaction banking and corporate clients in general.
I think going forward they'll obviously be some rate headwinds there which we think can be offset by organic growth, but given the investments that we have made there, Jamie mentioned InstaMed earlier.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Piepszak.
Client investment assets and consumer business banking were up 27% and asset and wealth management AUM was up 19% reflecting stronger market performance versus the prior year, as well as organic growth.
Revenue of $29.2 billion was up $2.4 billion or 9% year-on-year with net interest income down $220 million or 2% on lower rates largely offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB markets NII.
Revenue was up $7.2 billion, or 6% year-on-year with net interest income up $2.1 billion or 4% on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher average short-term rates, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates.
Noninterest revenue was at $5.1 billion, or 9% driven by growth across consumer and higher CIB markets revenues.
Revenue growth and our continued expense discipline generated positive operating leverage for the full year.
In consumer, credit costs were up $210 million reflecting an increasing card due to balance growth, largely offset by lower credit cost and home lending.
In Card, the increase is a result of moving to less time lost coverage versus a shorter lost emergence period under the incurred model whereas in wholesale modeling changes like using specific macroeconomic forecast versus through the cycle loss rates under incurred result in a decrease especially given the forecast to credit environments.
Home Lending revenue was down 5% driven by lower NII on lower balances which were down 17% reflecting prior loan sales and lower net servicing revenue predominantly offset by higher net production revenue reflecting a 94% increase in origination.
Expenses of $7.2 billion or up went by 2% driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business including market expansion largely offset by expense efficiencies.
This included a release in the home lending purchase credit impaired portfolio of $250 million reflecting improvements in delinquency and home prices, which was partially offset by a reserve build in card of $100 million driven by growth.
Fixed income markets was up 86% benefiting from a favorable comparison against a challenging fourth quarter last year, but also reflecting strength across businesses notably in securitized products and rates driven by strong client activity and monetizing flows.
Treasury services revenue was $1.2 billion down 3% year-on-year, primarily due to deposit margin compression which was largely offset by organic growth.
Gross investment banking revenues was $634 million, up 5% year-over-year driven by increased large deal activity.
Full year IB revenue was a record $2.7 billion up 10% on strong activity across segments with record results for both middle market and corporate client banking.
Finally, credit costs were $110 million with an NCO rate of 17 basis points, largely driven by a single name which was reserved for in prior quarters.
AUM of $2.4 trillion and overall client assets of $3.2 trillion, both records were up 19% and 18% respectively, driven by higher market levels as well as continued net inflows into long-term and liquidity products.
And you guys have been pretty clear that your business decisions are based on economic outcome or economic outcomes and not accounting outcomes and but CECL does materially change the way in which time -- changed the timing in which earnings accrete to book value in capital obviously with a higher upfront hit.
Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
I'm sorry, in fixed income, we call out securitized products and rate which were bright spots but broadly speaking obviously equities got a very strong quarter as well.
So just a question for Jamie because in the first paragraph you mentioned easing trade issues helped market activity.
Our next question is from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
",46.24,0.7034596
jpmc,q1,2020,"Before we get into the first quarter performance, we want to start by recognizing that this is an extremely challenging time for all of us and our thoughts are with those most affected by COVID-19, particularly those on the front lines of this crisis.
But at a high level, these items are, a credit reserve build $6.8 billion; approximately $950 million of losses in CIB, largely due to the widening of funding spreads on derivatives; and a $900 million markdown on our bridge book.
Revenue of $29.1 billion was down $782 million or 3% year-on-year, as net interest income was flat to the prior year due to the impact of lower rates, offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher CIB markets NII.
This quarter, credit costs were $8.3 billion including a net reserve build of $6.8 billion, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 and net charge-offs of $1.5 billion, in line with prior expectations.
Our net reserve build of $6.8 billion for the quarter consists of $4.4 billion in consumer, predominantly in card, and $2.4 billion and wholesale with builds primarily due to impact of COVID-19 as well as lower oil prices.
This reserve increase assumes in the second quarter that U.S. GDP is down approximately 25% and the unemployment rate rises above 10%, followed by solid recovery over the second half of the year.
In addition to these macro assumptions specific to each business, our consumer reserve build reflects our best estimate of the impact of payment relief that we are providing for our customers as well as the federal government stimulus programs.
Going forward, in order to leverage our balance sheet to serve our clients, we are prepared to use our internal buffers, which may mean our CET1 ratio falls below our target range and if necessary, we can also use regulatory buffers to go below our 10.5% minimum.
And lastly on this slide, credit costs included the $4.5 billion reserve builds I mentioned earlier and net charge-offs of $1.3 billion, driven by card and consistent with prior expectations.
Investment banking in the first half of the quarter showed continued momentum from last year, but as the market environment shifted, we saw delays in M&A announcements and completions, postponements of new equity issuance and increased draws on existing lines of credit.
At the same time, the investment grade debt market remained open and we helped our investment grade clients raise approximately $380 billion of debt in the quarter across a wide range of sectors.
And here, itÂs worth noting, our bridge book exposure is about a quarter of what it was, entering the 2008 crisis and is a higher quality portfolio.
ItÂs worth noting that even before the crisis, as we said at Investor Day, markets performance was strong for the quarter.
In wholesale payments and security services, tailwinds from this quarter, like elevated deposit balances, may be relatively short lived and more than offset by the impact of low rates and potentially lower transaction volumes if the crisis is elongated.
Revenue of $2.2 billion was down 10% year-on-year with lower deposit NII on lower rates and the $76 million markdown on the bridge book, partially offset by higher deposit balances.
Credit costs of $1 billion included the reserve builds I mentioned and $100 million of net charge-offs, largely driven by oil and gas.
Credit costs were $94 million, driven by reserve builds and the impact of COVID-19 as well as loan growth.
Based on the latest advice and what we know today, we expect to see further pressure from rates, partially offset by balance sheet growth in CIB markets and NII, which results in NII of about $55.5 billion for the full year.
In addition to the two significant items in the first quarter, these headwinds include a $3.5 billion decrease in noninterest revenue, all else equal, which is also due to the impact of rates and is the offset to higher CIB markets NII and therefore revenue neutral.
Although we donÂt quite know what the path will look like going forward, what we do know is that we will continue to be there for our employees, clients, customers and communities, as we always have been.
But, in terms of what weÂre seeing, those are the numbers, theyÂre still, as I said, relatively small compared to what we think weÂll ultimately see.
And so, we have assumed, as we could, for our first quarter results, the impact of those programs as well as the ultimate impact on payment relief that weÂll be providing for our customers.
And I just wanted to understand your thoughts on balancing, servicing your clients and also thinking about your capital levels relative to those automatic restrictions from the regulators.
And so, we think we have significant room to continue to serve our customers and clients through this crisis, but we are managing it quite carefully and looking at a range of scenarios.
But obviously, weÂre going to protect our company, our balance sheet,, our growth and weÂll be having close conversations with regulators about what that is.
But all else equal, given the deteriorated macroeconomic outlook, we would expect to build reserves in the second quarter.
Just given some of the significant declines at the long end of the curve, Jen, I was hoping you could help us think about where reinvestment levels are today, just compared with the 2.48% yield on the blended securities book?
And with lower rates, as low as the deposit growth that [Technical Difficulty] with the Fed balance sheet expansion, you do see a large increase in our investment securities portfolio this quarter, which makes a lot of sense.
How do we think about it in terms of how much is attributed to sort of mechanistic model related changes, where you calibrate your model for new economic scenario versus actual signs of stress that youÂre seeing your book that maybe arenÂt showing up in credit measures, but that you do think will show up in a reasonably short time period, call it within the next few quarters, how much of its growth, how much of its mix, just if you can talk to that?
And so, weÂre assuming as we think about our own capital plans that we will see revolver draws continue in the second quarter, albeit at lower level than the first quarter.
And then, from a credit perspective, as I said, we could see continued build over the next several quarters, but the way CECL works in theory, again, all else equal, is that that should be -- could be behind us by the end of the year, and we then have those reserves to absorb the losses that will inevitably emerge over the back half of this year and into 2021.
Can you give us any color on what kind of recovery youÂre expecting in the second half of the year thatÂs part of the CECL reserve building?
We know that we have a bridge loan book, because youÂre going to have quarters where things get bad and you might lose some money.
And like Jen said, so far if you look at spreads, itÂs probably a recovery this quarter.
Regarding credit cards, just based on payment rates that youÂve seen so far, and maybe the draws on revolves, how are you expecting card spending and card balances to trend over the next few quarters this year?
Because like I said, all else equal, given the macroeconomic outlook that weÂre looking at that we would expect to have a bill in the second quarter and perhaps, beyond, because as I said, obviously everything is incredibly fluid.
WeÂve mobilized our workforce around the globe to work remotely where feasible, including operations and finance teams, portfolio and risk managers, bankers and traders, ensuring they have the right tools to work effectively.
And while our call center capacity has been challenged, we quickly activated resiliency plans to address customer calls seeking assistance, and weÂve put in place new digital and self service solutions in record time.
For our customers who are struggling financially during this time, weÂre providing relief such as a 90-day grace period for mortgage, auto and card payments as well as waiving or refunding certain fees.
We continue to support our customers and clients by providing liquidity and advice during this challenging market environment.
And for our small business clients, weÂre actively supporting the SBAÂs Paycheck Protection Program.
And to help the most vulnerable and hardest hit communities as an initial step, weÂve announced $150 million loan program to give capital to underserved small businesses and nonprofits as well as a $50 million philanthropic investment.
While the underlying business fundamentals this quarter performed very well, we reported a number of significant items all due to impacts from COVID-19, which IÂll discuss in more detail later.
And on the far right, deposit growth accelerated meaningfully in March, most notably driven by wholesale clients as they secured liquidity and held those higher cash balances with us.
On the flip side, we saw significant net liquidity inflows into our government funds during March, which more than offset prime money market outflows.
Our balance sheet capital and liquidity going into this crisis were incredibly strong, and importantly allowed us to facilitate client needs in a period of stress.
And on the small business side, we saw significantly reduced inflows and merchant processing activities, early signs of pressure on payment and frequency rates as well as line utilization and increased demand for credit.
Average card loan growth was 8% with sales up 4% over the quarter, driven by January and February activity.
Expenses of $7.2 billion were up 3%, driven by revenue related costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business, partially offset by structural expense efficiencies.
Equity underwriting was up 25% versus a challenged first quarter last year and we saw strong activity in January and February before the market effectively closed in March.
As clients focused on preserving liquidity, we experienced higher deposit levels in wholesale payments throughout the quarter, offsetting revenue headwinds from lower rates and payments activity.
Commercial banking reported net income of $147 million including reserve builds of approximately $900 million.
Expenses of $988 million were up 5% year-on-year, consistent with the ongoing investments we discussed at Investor Day. Deposits were up 39% year-on-year on a spot basis and increased about $40 billion during the month of March with about half of that coming from clients drawing on their credit lines and holding their cash with us as they look to secure liquidity.
Higher originations and commercial term lending driven by the low rate environment were partially offset by declines in real estate lending as we remain selective.
Expenses of $2.7 billion were flat year-on-year with higher investments in the business as well as increased volume and revenue related expenses offset by lower structural expenses.
At the same time, we saw $75 billion of net liquidity inflows driven by significant inflows into our industry leading government funds in March, as I mentioned earlier.
AUM of $2.2 trillion and overall client assets of $3 trillion, up 7% and 4% respectively were driven by cumulative net inflows, partially offset by lower market levels.
And we now expect adjusted expenses for 2020 to be approximately $65 billion, largely due to lower volume and revenue-related expenses versus the outlook we provided at Investor Day. It goes without saying all of this is market dependent and weÂll keep you updated at future earnings calls.
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
But the quality of these portfolios looks strong coming in as weÂve done surgical risk management over the last few years.
Jamie talked about an extreme adverse scenario in his ChairmanÂs letter that weÂve looked at assuming large parts of the economy remaining in lockdown through the end of this year.
There will be a point -- and the last question brought it up was where you get below 10% CET1, even though weÂll have almost $200 billion in capital and $1 trillion liquidity, all these other constraints start to kick in, like SLR and G-SIFI, advanced risk-weighted assets that may kind of constrain it.
Banks are very careful to support their clients in times like this.
Is this fair to look at the severely adverse stress cases on a bank-run modeling basis that we have access to and itÂs in line with that kind of level or is this something thatÂs even a little bit tougher, and specifically around like things like commercial real estate?
But IÂm wondering on the commercial real estate side, is there anything we should be thinking about thatÂs different from perhaps what a Fed stress test might have suggested in the past?
Like, you know -- youÂve got to respect the credit card delinquencies and charges will go up that weÂve seen very little bit so far.
But again, itÂs going to just completely depend on whether people are able to remain performing under a payment relief or forbearance program.

morganstanley,q2,2015,"Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
As recent market volatility, particularly driven by events in Greece and China has demonstrated, the near-term landscape can change quickly.
Notable transactions in the quarter include an advisory; Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor to Time Warner Cable on the announced acquisition by Charter Communications valued at $79 billion.
In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley as lead left book runner priced FitbitÂs $841 million IPO.
This transaction highlights Morgan Stanley's continued leadership in transformative technology IPOs. In fixed income underwriting, we acted as lead left book runner on AbbVieÂs sixth tranche $16.7 billion debt offering to finance its previously announced acquisition.
Underwriting revenues were strong at $1 billion driven by a pickup in primary equity issuance and an industry record for quarterly new issue volumes for U.S. investment grade debt, which was aided by an uptick in M&A related financing.
The pipelines are healthy and while the third quarter historically maybe seasonally lighter for capital markets; we think longer-term positive trends remain intact.
Equity sales and trading had another excellent quarter with $2.3 billion of revenue, driven by high levels of client activity across all products.
Other revenues were up versus last quarter driven primarily by fees and marks on our lending and event book.
Lastly, average trading bar for the second quarter was $54 million, up slightly driven by increased client activity and choppier markets.
Asset management revenues were up 3% from last quarter driven by higher fee-based client balances from positive flows.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
James noted the two notch upgrade may help in FIC.
We did benefit from activity levels being higher in China this quarter.
Okay, great.
So we hear some commentary about potential for FIC share gains obviously there was some press a few weeks ago about whether or not there was a strategic change.
That doesnÂt mean we are not going to be more efficient providers and it doesnÂt mean that we wonÂt pick up share and that does mean that as these markets continue to grow relatively low volumes there wonÂt be more opportunity for us on the revenue side.
A $1 billion increase in whatÂs allocated to Wealth Management whether we look at average common equity or common equity Tier 1 linked quarter, whatÂs driving that?
ThatÂs obviously critically important because as you remember from our January presentation where we laid out some illustrative asset yields you saw that our lending products were generating 150 to 250 basis points more of yield than our AFS or cash or short-term investments.
Well, Mike firstly I admire your consistency in coming back to this question every quarter and thatÂs obviously something which remains a focus for us.
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
But right now in terms of our deposit balances we have excess deposits that we can deploy without requiring deposit balance but weÂre going to continue to try to penetrate our client base and grow those deposits with some new products going forward.
Our fixed strategy remains unchanged and we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reshape fixed-income and commodities into a more focused business.
Finally, in Investment Management, we delivered a strong quarter that benefited particularly from investment gains in merchant banking and real estate investing.
The efficiency ratio was 72% in the second quarter and we remain very focused on expense management both in terms of comp and non-comp expenses.
We continue to be disciplined on risk weighted assets in end of the quarter at a $157 billion of FIC RWAs. A meaningful portion of this decline was driven by a reduction in risk as client activity decreased, while Greece dominated the headlines in the middle of June, as well as our continued passive roll off.
During the quarter, consistent with our strategy of exiting physical oil, we also announced the sale of our global oil merchanting business and expect that to close later this year.
Our view remains positive as recovery further plays out in the U.S. We see steady performance in our business with growth coming from our bank strategy and fee-based programs.
Consistent with the execution of our U.S. bank strategy, net interest revenue increased 7% to $737 million, driven by growth in lending and realization of the forward curve in our Investment Securities portfolio.
Wealth Management lending balances grew $4 billion or 10% from the prior quarter.
In Investment Management, revenues were up 12% sequentially driven by gains in the real estate and merchant banking business and total AUM ended the quarter at $403 billion.
And I know itÂs always hard to answer, but between Asian equities so strong and second half usual seasonality in FIC and the big results in merchant banking and real estate, IÂm just looking for any guidance on how much of that we should expect moderating in the second half, just on seasonality?
I think as you said, Glenn, the business was much more balanced in the first half across all of our businesses and all of our products, in all our -- all of our geographies in terms of seasonality.
Yes, I think as you point out in merchant banking and our real estate business, we did see good principal gains in the quarter.
Maybe can you help us understand how much of a tailwind that was and then also given some of the volatility we have seen since the end of the second quarter, how are clients reacting to that and what is your expectation for continued strength in the region?
First I will comment our Asia-Pacific results and business, we are strong across all our businesses, equities, fixed income, and investment banking this quarter.
I would say that was more broadly dominated with some macro headlines towards the end of the year, not just in China, so we did see as we said risk positions come down and client engagement slow down a little bit in the back half of June and early parts of July.
We are clearly focused on improving the ROE in that business and we think weÂve made real progress here in the first half.
And as others have observed in the global FIC investment banking sales trading marketplace, there is clearly more turmoil in other parts of world than there is in the U.S. and we think that there is potential for over a period of time for share gain for our business.
We are more focused on how weÂre moving this business over a four or five year period and obviously the more recent result suggest itÂs moving in the right direction.
So I think in our Wealth Management business the drivers are still pretty consistent with what weÂve seen in prior quarters both in terms of the fee-based businesses as well as the deposit deployment and the improvement in NII.
In terms of our deposit deployment strategy and our excess liquidity in our banks, we still think that has room to play out and that will be a continuation and the primary driver of our NII growth going forward.
We saw $4 billion of loan lending balances increases in the Wealth Management business this quarter.
We saw lending balances increase about $6 billion in totality, so we had about $2 billion of growth from our Institutional Securities client and we see that trends continuing as well.
So again, a nice steady quarter in Wealth Management and weÂd expect those trends to continue.
At the same time IÂm looking at capital balances in institutional and they are down about a couple billion dollars this quarter.
And thirdly what is true is that we have been through that process over the last several years and feel like we have a business right sized where the risk weighted assets have come down from I donÂt know, Guy, about four years ago there were 390 billion I think in FIC and there we just reported somewhere close in the 160s.
Is that as simple as what you talked about in the opening remarks, that the balance sheet was smaller at the end of the quarter and it was going to kind of bounce around that way, or is there something more strategic going on with respect to for example, run-off of some of those legacy positions that you were talking about thatÂs driving down that FIC RWA, that's driving the -- almost $2 billion reduction in capital NIS?
I know you addressed it a little bit at your conference a few weeks ago, but maybe you can talk a little bit about the decline in interest rate sensitivity that was evident in your Q, the degree to which that might have reflected just a difference in asset deployment strategy, securities versus loans, whatever and whether there are any risk management elements that we need to think about with respect to the change there?
First would just be our overall interest rate position and how we think about NII, and then the second part of the question really around the disclosures.
And then lastly just on our overall interest rate positioning, our NII growth and results are in line and consistent with where we were in the beginning of the year in terms of our views.
The second comment about that disclosure is you know itÂs a 12 month disclosure and weÂre clearly focused on a longer term view when we think about our balance sheet and our interest rate positioning.
WeÂre obviously focused on the overall PBT in that margin -- PBT in that business which came in at 23%, which is we said before was up nicely and we continue to hopefully make progress in that going into the future quarters.
So, couple of questions on the longer term prospects of the Wealth Management business.
Firstly the reduction in the comp ratio is overwhelmingly driven by the business mix as in non-compensable for revenues and by the cost structure, non-compensation expenses that we've realized some benefits and scale coming out of the integration a couple of years ago of the Smith Barney deal.
One, we've got a stated target of $180 billion of FIC RWA in that business, weÂre going to clearly operate within that target.
CCAR continues to evolve quarter -- year-over-year, and we're going to continue to do our best to manage our capital ratio so we can return capital to our shareholders as well as continue to grow our business.
So just, when you think about going forward, in a positive revenue environment, I just wanted to get an update on some of the targets that you had for like the comp ratios by segment and probably more importantly on the non-comp side, because that's been fairly well managed, thereÂs obviously been some volatility around legal in the past.
And I think we feel good about the growth rates that weÂve seen and our ability to penetrate our client base.
As I mentioned, we had about $2 billion of growth in the Institutional Securities balances this quarter.

morganstanley,q3,2015,"Please see our SEC filings including this quarterÂs earnings release and financial supplement at www.morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley.
Our wealth management franchise was impacted by a lack of new issue product and a general retail investor step back from markets, given volatility.
Besides the normal summer seasonality, the quarter was characterized by global equity markets trending lower, volatility metrics increasing, spreads widening, policy uncertainty and periodic bouts of risk aversion.
Equity underwriting revenues were $250 million, down 49% versus second quarter, primarily reflecting declines across all products, particularly for IPOs and follow-ons.
Fixed income underwriting revenues were down 29% versus the second quarter driven by decreases in both investment grade and non-investment grade loan and bond underwriting.
Notable underwriting transactions in the quarter includes in equity, Morgan Stanley acted as joint underwriter and joint lead manager on a $3.6 billion rights offering for Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
Coming off of two strong quarters, equity sales and trading again was solid, against a backdrop of significantly more volatility.
Prime brokerage revenues remained solid, although down from a very strong second quarter, which is seasonally high related to European dividend activities.
FX results were up modestly versus second quarter as increased volatility led to continued client engagement.
Asset management revenues were flat from last quarter with higher revenues from fee-based accounts, partially offset by lower mutual fund activity.
Global fee-based asset inflows were $7.7 billion in the quarter, continuing the trend we see toward client demand for managed accounts.
Transactional revenues were also impacted by subdued levels of retail investor activity, driven by ongoing uncertainty and global volatility.
And securities-based lending remains highly over collateralized and continued to perform well despite the quarter's volatility.
Total assets under management ended the quarter at approximately $404 billion.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
We think bringing it together with equities and having one sales and trading business is the most efficient and effective way to serve our clients and we'll come back over time with whatever changes that might imply.
Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC.
Your final question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.
First, and obviously fixed income underperformed in the quarter, largely due to a very challenging market environment, in which we were significantly impacted given our business mix, particularly our focus on credit and rates.
Second, most of the investment management business performed solidly, but the aggregate results significantly underperformed.
Notwithstanding the challenges of the quarter, our core long-term strategy remains in place, namely, a balanced business model in which the consistency of wealth management offsets potential volatility in institutional securities.
Compensation expense was $3.4 billion, down 22% versus $4.4 billion last quarter, driven by lower revenues.
We saw underperformance in fixed income, driven by relative mix of our business, primarily by lower revenue in credit and securitized products in a challenging credit market, in addition to lower activity and rates given investor uncertainty on said action.
Equity sales and trading revenues were strong, as clients remained engaged across regions and products, and in advisory, we had our best quarter in several years, as M&A volumes remain strong.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 15%, driven primarily by increased litigation reserve, I mentioned previously.
In investment banking, we saw strong performance in our M&A business offset by weakness in the debt and equity underwriting markets, resulting in investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion, down 18% sequentially.
The business remained number one in the US, and we believe we continue to be number one globally, driven by our focus on clients and execution, which has led us to our leadership position.
Ex-DVA, revenues of $1.8 billion in the quarter were down 22% sequentially, but essentially flat year-over-year, as clients remained active and engaged.
Cash equity revenues were down versus the second quarter and year-over-year, driven by a more challenging environment, including a lighter primary calendar and periods of risk aversion.
Derivative revenues were down quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower corporate derivative activity, but remained strong and were up year-over-year.
For the quarter, fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenue were $583 million, excluding DVA, down 54% versus the second quarter.
Rates revenues in the quarter were down sequentially, driven by significant policy uncertainty, that led to sporadic client activity and engagement.
Investment revenues were up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by gains on business-related investments.
Over the past few years, our daily revenues are a good indication of the stability and consistency of our wealth management business and they have consistently been between $50 million and $70 million, with no day year-to-date below this range.
Net interest income revenue increased 2% quarter-over-quarter, driven by steady, prudent growth in lending, consistent with the continued execution of our US bank strategy.
Funded lending balances in wealth management grew approximately $3 billion during the quarter and $12 billion year-over-year.
Deposits in our bank deposit program were $139 billion, up $7 billion versus the second quarter, as clients moved into cash and a volatile market.
Wealth management representatives were up slightly versus the second quarter on lower attrition.
In investment management, the quarter was difficult, for Asia valuations in particular in China and monetization events, which resulted in revenues of $274 million, down 64% sequentially.
The vast majority of the sequential declines in revenue could be attributed to the reversal of previously-accrued carried interest in our Asia private equity business and no material gains in our other funds versus last quarter.
This quarter however, we had to reverse more than two-thirds of the carry that our Asia private equity funds had accrued.
I think in terms of our equities performance, as we said, we continued to maintain our leadership position and we are number one.
And then lastly, I think on the repricing question, I would answer by saying that we've been focused on the returns to the prime brokerage business, and we've done that in partnership with our clients and looking at the relationship holistically across the nine boxes that we've discussed before.
We've done this through a combination of better business mix, optimization and wider pricing, and we've seen the revenue per balance sheet usage increase over the last year.
I'll just add a couple of things to what Jon said, Guy. Firstly, if you look at the performance of fixed this year, you've seen three very different quarters.
I think combining the fixed income business with equities under the leadership of Mr. And we continue to watch this space very carefully.
We're by no means complacent about this, and but at the same time, there are elements of our fixed income business which are essential to everything else that we do in investment banking with our wealth management and so on.
We'll give him a little time to get his arms around the business with the management team there, which they will do, and I'm sure in the New Year, we'll be saying a lot more about it.
It is obviously a significantly smaller business for us than equities or wealth management.
What I would say, Mike, is if you look at that line in our supplement there in terms of the investment, it was negative $235 million this quarter versus a positive $232 million in the second quarter.
The two drivers of that is one, virtually all of that negative number can be attributed to the reversal of carry from our Asia PE business, and two, in the second quarter, we saw significant monetization events across the entire fund complex and we didn't see any material monetization events in this quarter.
We delivered 23% margin on lower revenues in wealth management, which is exactly what we said we would do in strategy.
Jonathan, just on the wealth management business, if we look at the transaction revenues not just for the quarter, but even year-to-date, looks like they've been weaker.
But really want to understand the mix of that business, because when we're in more volatile environments, we can see some quarters where some weird things happen.
For the full year, right, there is an adjustment period as the geographic mix, there is the actual mix of earnings based on legal entity versus a managed business, as well as sort of a look forward of what we think that mix is going to look like.
But as Â sort of has been alluded to, equities and wealth management has seemed to have gone well and this is the one business that has continued to draw attention.
Listen, I think we've said what we've wanted to say about this quarter.
One was on the wealth management net interest income, where in the previous couple of quarters, certainly Q2 you mentioned the realization of the forward curve and your investment securities proposal has been a factor.
",46.51,0.88490695
morganstanley,q4,2015,"While weÂve been reshaping fixed for several years, the volatile and shrinking revenue pool coupled with the steady increase in capital requirements led us to take further significant action at year end.
We believe our robust equity base coupled with a derisk balance sheet and a transformed business mix, provides a strong foundation to support our current plan.
Notwithstanding considerable efforts to reduce the capital required to support FIC, further regulatory changes in recent years and a prolonged difficult environment led us to believe that much more radical actions were necessary.
Even closer integration with equities and banking within Institutional Securities, and in partnership with Wealth Management against our core client base, will allow us to enhance asset velocity and ultimately optimize wallet.
In addition to our focus on compensation discipline, we have launched a major company-wide initiative called Project Streamline, an effort lead by our CFO Jon Pruzan, and COO Jim Rosenthal, which is designed to identify and implement significant infrastructure expense reductions by the end of 2017.
Now letÂs turn to Wealth Management on Slide 15.
We continue to see strong high quality loan demand on our Wealth Management client base.
A highly scalable business like Wealth Management enables us to add sources of revenue with lower compensation payouts such as net interest growth.
The challenging fixed income markets against which weÂve carried outsized capital levels.
We continued to see pressure from volatility in fixed income underwriting volumes and revenues were $346 million, down 7% versus the third quarter, driven by decreases in loan fees partially offset by investment grade bond fees.
Fixed income and commodity sales and trading continue to under-perform in a difficult environment, characterized by spread widening in various products and lower levels of client activity.
Deposits in our bank deposit program were $149 billion at year-end up $10 billion versus the third quarter reflecting normal seasonality in deposits as well as clientÂs moving to cash in a volatile market.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
But weÂre setting ourselves up for increasing returns over the next several years at the same time letÂs make investments across the rest of the business.
Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
Last quarter we saw that kind of negative accrual I think on the Asia private equity your Merchant Banking fund [ph], just what type of exposure unit in the investment management business have Â those types of products so we can see those swings.
And then in wealth management I feel like the transaction revenues have been pretty weak for a while and thatÂs more of an industry trend but just wanted to figure out are we stabilizing here, meaning are there pressures there somewhat coming to a slowdown?
Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Good morning, thanks for taking my question.
Good morning, thanks for taking my question.
But I guess IÂm curious how youÂre thinking about what appears to be a greater level of regulatory scrutiny both in areas like leverage lending, but also in commercial real estate which seem Â which where youÂve grown quite visibly over the last two years to three years as youÂve pushed on your bank growth program.
Okay, thanks for taking my questions.
Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
So on the other hand, investment banking has been operating at a high level as you highlighted, a choppy market could impact those businesses.
And then just within the Wealth Management comp target that improvement to less than 56%, is that and entirely driven by leverage off of higher margin revenues like NII or are there other core comp expense reductions that they can occur within GWN, the GWN that we should be thinking about?
Your final question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC.
We acted on those things within our control by initiating a major restructuring affect, conducting a large reduction in force in December, reducing our compensation-to-revenue ratio, launching a large scale firm-wide expense initiative, more on that later, significantly reducing RWAs impact to $136 billion, well below our target of $180 billion, and closing the sale of our oil merchanting business.
In our Institutional Securities business, we have maintained our leadership positions in Investment Banking and equity sales and trading, as illustrated on Slide 4.
In banking, we continue to see strength and finished second in global announced M&A and number one in IPOs. Slide 5 recaps what we laid out last year and our results.
In Wealth Management, we achieved a full-year profit margin of 22%, with pre-tax earnings of $3.3 billion, a record for this business.
We maintained our focus on expense management and achieved a full-year ISG compensation ratio ex-DVA of 37%, below our stated goal of 39% or less.
These include capital sufficiency, expense efficiency, Wealth Management revenue growth and capital returns to shareholders.
Given the cyclical, and in some cases structural challenges facing fixed income, driven by the work Colm and Ted did at the end of last year, we took the decision to downside headcount by 25%, along with our ongoing balance sheet and capital focus.
As such we have set a net target ratio of 74% in 2017, which translates into $1 billion in expense reductions over the next two years.
To be clear, we do not expect the revenue environment to apply, especially given ongoing growth initiatives like Lending and Wealth Management; however, we believe this assumption is appropriately conservative.
In a volatile environment, we benefited from the strength of our equities, investment banking and wealth management businesses.
In a challenging environment for some of our institutional security business, overall revenues ex-DVA were $3.5 billion, up 2% quarter-on-quarter.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 13% driven by lower litigation costs.
Turning to underwriting, equity underwriting revenues were $352 million up 41% versus the third quarter, primarily reflecting increases in IPOs. The fourth quarter was a continuation of the strength we have seen all year in equity sales and trading as clients remained active and we delivered across products and regions in a volatile market.
Given the sale of our two large physical oil businesses, we would expect to see less seasonality in our first quarter FIC results going forward.
In our wealth management business, we continue to see steadiness, for the quarter and for the full-year 2015, we saw average revenues per day of approximately $60 million with no day below $50 million.
Revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion, excluding the impact of differed compensation plan investments in both periods revenues were approximately flat sequentially.
Let me start by saying first, weÂve laid out RWA targets, so there Â for I think the last three years and going back I still remember a number like $392 billion or there about in around the third quarter of 2011 in FIC.
I guess is there any way that we could think about revenue or you could maybe help us to frame how to think about revenue, because obviously if you are going to take that much capital out, right.
You talked about focusing on some of the strengths a few business lines maybe you could help us think about which businesses you are going to be deemphasizing and how much revenue you think realistically could come out as a result of that.
I think the basic position we are in was we had more balance sheet and more capital in the business than we were generating revenues on.
So we donÂt think thereÂs going to be great revenue diminution from this point given where we finished 2015, which frankly as we said we are very candid that was disappointing.
Yes, the one thing I would add is just to give you a better sense of some of the things we are getting out of as James mentioned, most of that is not in the U.S. Things like sovereign CDS, some of the non-core European currencies, Asia distressed trading, some of the bespoke [ph] correlation products as well as all of the work weÂve done on our commodities business in terms of the oil merchanting businesses as well as the announcement regarding our European power and gas last year.
Obviously, itÂs with the appropriate caveat which you would expect if we have a major outsized litigation expense or penalties that are unforeseen if the markets completely collapse here if we have no revenue growth, if the Fed responded very differently to our capital plans than what we intended it gets harder.
We were happy to see the litigation expense go down in the fourth quarter, but in terms of breaking out those individual numbers, we have historically not done that but again itÂs Â it does require no major single individual event.
In terms of the Â what I would say is the slide in the deck is only in the wealth management segment so itÂs not a total lends on the bank.
WeÂll be coming back to you with more detail throughout the year but in terms of the 2016 number that loan growth that you see out of wealth management would be consistent with those targets.
And if we think about a backdrop where thereÂs 4% annual revenue growth, a 74% efficiency ratio, 32% tax rate, and flat preferreds and non-controlling interest, it gets to you about $6 billion of net income to common and if I even take just the low end of that 9% to 11% ROE range, the implied common equity is about $66 billion which suggests payouts in excess of 100% over the next two years.
So as we laid out on the page, first of all the compensation, the billion dollars plus of compensation and non-comp savings are assuming a flat revenue environment so if we get out two years and weÂre flat to today our ratio will be 74%.
As James mentioned we do expect revenue growth throughout this period and therefore the efficiency ratio should be lower than the 74% because we do have operating leverage in the business.
And Jonathan, I think you spend a lot of time talking about capital and obviously itÂs going to be contingent on the feedback you get from regulators and presumably they would be inclined or incentivized to reward actions to reduce your systemic risk footprint or exposure system with more risk intensive activities, based on your discussions have you been given any indication that they would be perceptive to higher payouts for those that are willing to shrink more aggressively in those areas.
No, I donÂt think thatÂs possible but do I believe that weÂre going to be in a position where we increase our returns, absolutely.
WeÂre doing it because we think these businesses should be run with returns at or above 10% and nobody in this world predicted the last four or five years of whatÂs gone in the markets and the amount of capital that would be required to support these businesses when I took this job our capital base was $40 billion, today itÂs $69 billion.
We believe there is revenue growth across many parts of our business over a two year period and we believe we are sufficiently capitalized given the world that we operate in so if you add all those pieces together putting it in terms of a target to help investors have a framework rather than open ended seem to be the right transition point for Morgan Stanley.
James, just on the FIC side of the business, post restructuring, I know itÂs tough to gauge but when you mentioned and you look at the revenue environment and kind of where your run rate now, you wouldnÂt expect much of a drop-off.
No, I think of that in terms of the full year, obviously the second half but our revenue run rates of $500 million were incredibly low.
But we look what the total market size is what our share is, and what our expected share is, and expected market size in the next couple of years and thatÂs why we say we believe weÂre right-sized for revenue rate equivalent to 2015.
This quarter it was $100 million that return to a positive number was driven by all of our Â most of our investing businesses both private equity infrastructure and real estate that was more balanced.
Before getting that page in front of me, I think the results this quarter, we did see Asia was down, but it continues to be a strong and important part of our business.
Just this minute, but that you should also know is managed, the way we look at the business is on a managed basis, and so those revenues donÂt necessarily tied back to the tax rate that I talked about earlier regarding the geographic mix of earnings.
Okay, thank you, and then a little closer to home, how are you thinking, it seems that youÂre assuming that lending both in the corporate side of things, as well as Within Wealth Management is going to continue at what appears to be roughly similar growth rate as you saw this year.
So, Matt, IÂm not sure, I wouldnÂt agree with that statement, I think historically over the last couple of years, weÂve seen good growth in both the ISG lending product as well as the Wealth Management lending product and those have been the key drivers along with deploying our deposits away from securities into these loans.
When we think about the 3% to 5% revenue growth with ROE target, yes, some items like NII should increase without the backdrop changing and hopefully will be above that.

morganstanley,q1,2016,"The securities businesses were exposed to a number of these factors, which led to a more challenging revenue environment than what we have come to expect in the first quarter of the year.
The S&P level at the end of the first quarter will help with asset pricing in our Wealth Management business, where we continue to grow our lending book and see flows into managed accounts.
As part of Streamline, we are reshaping our expense base, and have embarked on an aggressive evaluation of our global infrastructure costs, reviewing each product, business and geography globally to convince ourselves that we need our footprint as it is currently configured.
As James said, the beginning of 2016 got off to a challenging start as negative sentiment and volatility prevailed in the global markets, undermining the traditional strength and client activity we have typically seen at the start of the year.
Advisory revenues for the quarter were the strongest post-crisis at $591 million, up 15% as the deals announced last year continue to close.
Prime brokerage revenues were higher this quarter as we work closely with our clients and continue to focus on the efficiency of our balance sheet and returns.
As a reminder, 40% of our approximately $15 billion funded and unfunded energy exposure is fair value or held for sale, where we mark-to-market daily and have taken markdowns this quarter.
The first quarter for commission revenues were the lowest we have seen in the last five years, reflecting the very cautious attitude of investors in this highly uncertain environment.
Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $526 million, up 5% versus 4Q, reflecting the steadiness of this revenue line, and AUM was essentially unchanged at $405 billion.
Investment revenues in the quarter were a loss of $64 million, driven by volatility and particular weakness in emerging market investments, resulting in mark-downs and some reversal of carry.
Lastly, in the quarter, as you will see in our supplement, we modified our segment common equity allocation disclosure to base it on fully phased in regulatory capital, as the market has focused more on these ratios than the transitional ratios.
Turning to the outlook, across sales and trading, we do not believe that the backdrop we saw in the first quarter will become a permanent state and have already seen some improvement in market conditions.
In Wealth Management, we would expect to see the stability and trends seen in the last several quarters to continue.
So when we think about those targets in that revenue range of up low-single digits to down 20%, how much of the cost structure can be managed, particularly, if we're not Â obviously, not down 20%, but even if we're plus or minus 5% on the revenue base, is that still an environment where, by the end of 2017, the targets are still attainable?
I think it's Â I know we're going to get a lot of calls on this, because that's the perils of putting out a target is you get asked about it every time, every quarter until you finally get there.
We're going to work with our clients to provide solution to their investment needs, and I think, by the end of the day, overall impact to both our clients and our financial results are very manageable.
We've got about $800 billion in managed accounts now, about 40% of our assets, and we think we can continue to grow that.
And then, with respect to trading, particularly in FIC, it sounds like the quarter ended on a better note, so can you just maybe help us think about that as it carry into April and is it Â across businesses and really within credit specifically, it seems like that was one area that was a little bit of a headwind, so how are markets there and how's activity started this quarter?
We did see a pickup towards the end of March that sort of followed through a little bit here in the first couple of weeks of April, although, obviously, the events over the weekend and what we've seen in Asia and some of the commodities is just a stark reminder that we're going to continue to see periods of volatility here.
Obviously, a lot of moving pieces with a weak macro, restructuring that you're doing, but as you think about kind of more of a steady state or a typical first quarter, and I can appreciate it's very hard to frame, but are you thinking leverage of kind of 50% higher from where we are here or how are you right-sizing the cost base?
Since also the first quarter of last year, we continue to restructure and reshape this business both in terms of its footprint and capital intensity.
In the first quarter or at the end of last year, we had about $190 billion of RWA dedicated to the business and, today, that number is closer to $130 billion.
We were going to try to maintain the revenue footprint and, therefore, it was obviously going to improve the overall profitability of the business.
I guess my question on the back of that though is there any change to the expectation that FIC, as a result of the strategic actions that you took late last year, that it could free up more than $5 billion to $8 billion in capital over time?
Listen, I think that the plan that we laid out in January in terms of the actions around the balance sheet and SLR footprint leads to about $5 billion to $8 billion of freed-up capital.
We said in the past that we might reinvest some of that back into other ISG businesses, so that line item might not move as people would expect, but, again, we're going to evaluate all of our businesses and all of our assets and investments to see if we can be more capital efficient.
Maybe a follow-up on that is as the fixed income business continues to evolve, it would seem that it is going to evolve to be more of a digital market business with probably less of a human, but also probably over time still less of an economic capital footprint associated with it.
The speed in which that happens is obviously going to be determined over time, and we do think we are well-positioned given our leadership that we've shown in digital and electronic products in the past.
So, I think we're going to continue to manage it tightly.
I think the fact that we no longer have the physical oil business should reduce the seasonality that we saw in this business, clearly, but also many of the changes that we've made are going to try to hopefully improve the consistency of this business.
This quarter is a decent starting point, because we didn't have the physical oil business in it, but we obviously had a difficult macro backdrop.
We need to get the ROE of this business up, and one of the ways we're going to do that is being much more efficient in our expense management.
But I think the real growth in NII for us within the Wealth Management business is going to come from the fact that we expect the average earning assets to grow probably by Â in the bank to grow probably by $10 billion to $15 billion this year.
Hi, the new CEO letter talks about progress with the business mix, banking equities and other areas, but the ROE, as you pointed out, was only 6% in the first quarter.
But, as I said, and they weren't caveats, they were just reality, they implied that we hit our expense targets on a flat revenue environment, that our total revenues grew somewhere between 3% and 5%, and that we did the right thing around right-sizing our fixed income business and freeing up the right capital.
So, listen, we're making steady progress, we're committed to our goals, we'll continue pushing on expenses, we'll do what we can to free up excess capital, and we believe the environment is likely to improve from where we saw the bottoms of the first quarter.
So in the first quarter of 2015, you saw the 19% Wealth Management ratio, I think the better comparison, the change in any capital allocation, if you look at the middle two columns, the business went from 14% to 12%.
Again, the ROE targets are for the firm Â for all of our capital and, as we've mentioned in the past, we are clearly trying to drive improved profitability in that business by maintaining the revenues, reducing the capital and reducing the costs.
We laid out a plan just this past January that said we were going to try to maintain the revenue footprint that we've seen in the past, reduce the capital intensity and reduce the costs.
Just trying to understand better how we should think about the run rate of the cost line with this Streamline Project coming on.

Good morning, this is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
Markets were challenging, equity issuance was effectively non-existent, and retail activity was extremely subdued, reflecting the many uncertainties with which investors grappled.
These included negative interest rates internationally, questions around the pace of Fed activity in the U.S., the growth rate of the Chinese economy, and growing concerns about geopolitical issues like the migration crisis and potential for Brexit, among others.
M&A was robust, equities once again delivered a strong performance, and Wealth Management generated a pre-tax margin greater than 21% despite market headwinds and fewer trading days.
We made real progress in our expense discipline ahead of our broader initiative called Project Streamline, which, as we said, will play out over the next two years.
In order to drive capital returns to shareholders on a more substantial base than our current CCAR submission is asking for, we must continue to reduce those parts of our business that give rise to the high stress losses and capital deductions and/or balance sheet usage.
During the first quarter, we early adopted the accounting guidance that requires that DVA be presented in accumulated other comprehensive income as opposed to net revenues.
We are building the next-generation Wealth Management desktop and mobile suite for both our financial advisors and clients, while optimizing and automating our operations and work flow.
In particular, there are opportunities across our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management businesses where we have the ability to drive efficiencies while improving collaboration.
Equity underwriting revenues were $160 million, down 55% versus 4Q, driven largely by the significant decreases in IPOs. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $239 million, down 31% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting a slowdown in high-yield and leveraged loan markets.
This translated into ongoing muted levels of client activity across our Fixed Income & Commodities business.
Other revenues were down versus fourth quarter, driven by an increase in our allowance for loan losses for our held for investment portfolio.
Our loan-loss provision on our HFI portfolio of $127 million this quarter was predominantly against our energy portfolio.
Wealth Management revenues for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, down 2% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting muted client activity in an unfavorable market environment as well as fewer trading days.
Funded lending balances in Wealth Management grew approximately $2 billion or 5% during the quarter and $12 billion or 30% year-over-year.
Non-compensation expenses were down 5% versus fourth quarter, driven by seasonally lower expenses in marketing and business development.
The increase reflects a low fourth quarter spot asset level given lower client activity at the end of the year as well as higher levels of liquidity in the first quarter.
Pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $386 billion, down from $395 billion in the fourth quarter.
So making sure we have good products and services across that full spectrum is going to be important and I think the recent hire that we made on our digital strategy to lead that in Wealth Management is really going to yield some interesting innovations going forward.
Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.
Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. I think there's still quite a bit of benefit to come from your initiatives there.
Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thank you very much.
And could you talk about your vision for fixed income now that Ted has been overseeing it for a long enough time to maybe start to think about how it becomes more digital?
And then, thinking about the loan book here, you all saw NII grow faster than loans here this quarter in Wealth Management.
Yeah, sorry.
You had 5% annualized buybacks this quarter, which is decent, but you also mentioned on the call now that you can reduce the impact of businesses with high stress losses.
We made some really good progress against non-comp expenses and maintained comp discipline before we really got into the meat of Project Streamline.
So we think we can build from 13%, but this business does require capital given our lending focus.
Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc. And one of the questions we're getting quite a bit is how we should reconcile the revised fully phased in capital allocations that you have with essentially a CCAR required or spot required capital target; potentially, the minimum level of capital you'll need for CCAR to get through the test unscathed while also supporting higher payouts.
Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc. As it relates to your G-SIB scores, clearly you've made significant progress in reducing your RWAs. And some of your peers have noted they've moved into lower buckets.
It was on the fixed income RWAs. But also recognize that that number might bounce around a bit based on client activity, but we're pretty happy with the progress we've made.
I guess really nice margin expansion in Wealth Management, but organic growth just remains poor or weak, whether measured by fee-based flows or financial advisor head count.
I'm just curious if you think organic growth is necessary for the long-term health of this business?
I just want to understand, specifically within FIC as it relates to your broader guidance, would the business have been profitable at the current run rate of revenues given the expense reduction?
Good morning, thanks for taking my question.
Jon, at what point this quarter, if at all, did you all think about utilizing the de minimis exception to potentially increase your buybacks this quarter since they've been pretty steady at the $625 million level over the course of this current CCAR cycle?
",49.99,0.8363679
morganstanley,q2,2016,"We made particular progress in fixed income and commodities where we generated approximately $1.3 billion in revenue, up significantly from the first quarter.
Profit before taxes for the quarter was $2.5 billion versus $1.7 billion in 1Q 2016 highlighting the operating leverage we have in the business model.
Fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenues were $1.3 billion, up 49% versus the first quarter.
Wealth management performed well in the second quarter with revenues of $3.8 billion, up 4% sequentially.
First just a question on fixed, obviously a very solid result, and you alluded to post Brexit activity, but generally, if you could comment on the ability to produce $1 billion plus quarterly revenue in say despite as youÂve pointed out the sale of the oil merchanting and the 25% headcount reduction, at the end of last year, is there any warning on sustainability here that you want to issue and if not, maybe just give us a sense for how it is that you could have done a headcount reduction that wasn't as significant as it was and still see revenue in that kind of range.
I think as you know when we laid out our plan in the beginning of the year, we talked about being a critical incredibly size fixed income business that was relevant to our clients, but also supported are other businesses.
Year-to-date, our performance is at around $2.1 billion to $2.2 million so it's in-line with that revenue footprint.
Oil prices going from 38 to 48 versus the wild swings that we saw in the first quarter, so broadly a very strong performance.
We made a lot of changes that we think will help this business and this will take time, but we've been pleased with the progress that we have seen to date.
Listen, my view was that there was a general overreaction to the underperformance of FIC and from the middle of last year through the first half of the first quarter and I saw very little downside risk to the business.
And we came to a fundamental view at the end of last year to do two things, one is to realign the staff for what we thought was a $1 billion run rate business and maybe it's more and maybe we're not going to get ahead of ourselves obviously there's more this quarter.
And with that come lots of operational synergies, risk management synergies, overall management client coverage synergies with our SRM our senior relationship management program and I think that wasn't going to evidence itself in the days and weeks following the realignment, but we felt pretty confident in the months and years following it, it would and maybe we're starting to see some of that.
Thirdly just on the particular mix of our business, obviously we're more credit centric to macro, but we do have a very good FX business that benefited, you have seen a lot more volatility in rates and clearly the credit markets as Jon said recovered not just in the core fixed income business, but in commodities.
So, the combination of all of these things said that yes it's a good number this quarter.
And again just to add to this one because it is a critical question, I think that one has to take into account that the wealth management market in this country is actually extremely diverse.
Do you think that that opportunity allowed you to over earn somewhat in FIC this quarter or at least present a more unusual and robust revenue opportunity, which is why you were able to punch above that $1 billion per quarter run rate, and as we think about that run rate seasonally, when we look into the back half, should we think about that being lower or is it going to be less seasonal because of the changes you made to the business?
So, the way we would describe Brexit in the impact, I think in the first quarter if you recall and then through sort of the conference season we said that January and February were very challenging markets.
So good luck with that, but we take a slightly longer term view and again, our base case is billion dollar run rate a quarter we think is what the business should be producing in this time and environment and if it does better than that great, and that's kind of where we are at.
As you think about this business a bit longer term, as well and you think about some of the changes that are coming, from a regulatory perspective, how much do you anticipate your product shelf for commission accounts may be impacted?
And we also saw this quarter some of the streamline initiatives that are ultimately going to help this business.
But we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow this business going forward, even though we have seen lower levels of engagement given the uncertainty in the market.
And then last question, you had a good quarter, but still just an ROE of 8.3%, I think I heard you reiterate the 9% to 11% target for 2017, so what's left.
It feels good in this environment, but the 8.3% also recall as Jon pointed out the tax rate was pretty high this quarter.
Obviously, we have a pretty concrete game plan on the quarter around going forward around what we can do in wealth management where rates ultimately will impact the pipeline that we have in the investment banking calendar, and I think the broader changes going on in the global investment banking industry.
I know you're not going to give us the number, but I'm looking for anything directional on, profitability must have improved a lot given headcounts down 25%, RWA is down a lot and revenues are now well.
Part of that was the commodities business and you have since sold Oil Merchanting, IÂm just curious, not for next quarter, but just as a general comment the pacing of that $4 billion a year target goal, whatever you want to call it.
At the end of the quarter, we saw a spike as you said supporting our clients, a lot of that was in sort of low intensity RWA assets and that sort of drives the discrepancy there.
On the second point, I think the target that we laid out is the 37% - ISG comp ratio year-to-date 36% I think looking over the total year is more important than any given quarter but we are also benefiting from the headcount changes that we made in the fourth quarter.
If we do get some opportunity as we get into next year that you get to release a chunk, when you think about where that ratio is, where your SLR is, and if you are able to release capital from a business mix standpoint, do you feel like you guys are where you need to be and the gist of it is if you are able to release the capital obviously you will see one can come down but your SLR will be somewhat impacted.
You guys hit on cost and the margins, I think James you mentioned in terms of the transaction part of the business, theyÂre relatively low just given retail engagement.
We feel good about the investments that we are making around the GOL but I think itÂs still little early to say.
You have continued good loan growth this quarter, deposits were down a little bit versus last quarter but still up nicely year-over-year.
So as I mentioned, $3 billion of loan growth this quarter, $5 billion year-to-date, continued good growth there and I think we feel pretty good about that trend.
I think the investments that we are making into digital and some of the cash management products make us feel good about our ability to continue to grow broadly our deposit base and again I think the bank strategy has been a real bright spot for us and we would expect that to continue going forward.
May be we could just sort of dig into the RWA decline this quarter, I think you were down $20 billion, FIC was down $8 billion, so you actually had more outside of FIC.
I think the composition of our book as you said we are making some minor, we continue to bring down our FIC RWAs but we made a lot of progress there, so I would expect it to be pretty comparable.
And given the reduction that we've seen over the last couple of quarters and many of your more risk intensive assets, where do you believe the surcharge is today and how you are thinking about managing to that going forward given some of the opportunities not just to mitigate but potentially to even grow in some of the trading areas as competitors return?
As we said in the past, we're going to continue to try to manage and mitigate that if we can.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
IÂll make a few brief introductory remarks and then Jon will take you through the numbers and of course we both as always look forward to your questions.
Our team had several objectives coming into the quarter as follows: managing the uncertain macroeconomic environment; continuing the momentum we are building in fixed income while preserving stability in our other businesses; maintaining expense discipline; and obtaining approval for our capital plan under CCAR.
We saw continued stability and progress in our core businesses with each performing roughly in line with expectations given the environment.
On expenses, we remain focused on our cost discipline but tactically and through project streamline.
As we said publicly, we consider this outcome suboptimal, but it did indeed provide us with a live stress scenario as we endured record high volumes and spikes of volatility, our liquidity remains strong, our systems ran smoothly and our clients access the market quickly and in size.
Commodities benefited from better credit performance and market conditions, specifically a stabilization in energy credits resulting in an increase in client activity.
Other revenues were up versus first quarter, primarily driven by better credit performance for a held for investment and held for sale relationship loans.
Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $517 million, essentially flat versus 1Q.
Investment revenues in the quarter improved to $50 million versus a loss in 1Q 2016, driven by improved performance across a number of funds including private equity and real estate investments.
Investment revenues remained volatile as global markets and asset prices adjust to the changing political landscape and growth dynamic.
As the coming months unfold, we will remain nimble where we see client opportunities, while staying rigorous to our project streamline and other expense initiatives.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski, with Autonomous Research.
Hey Guy, itÂs Jon. I highlighted SBG tightening spreads help, strong performance in agencies, FX was aided by the volatility we saw from Brexit, commodities clearly better credit performance we had a much more stable backdrop.
Okay that answers the question quite robustly thank you.
Secondly, efficiencies around automation; that will be helpful not only from an expense standpoint, but also giving FAs and clients more time to be together and not focus on paperwork and doing other things like that.
Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
Second question, retail clients on the sidelines due to Brexit, have they come off the sidelines what are you seeing among retail investors now?
Okay Jon. 15% year-on-year, but GAAP assets had actually increased, I think in your prepared remarks you said something about supporting client activity related to Brexit, but just curious if you could expand on that a little bit, RWA following GAAP assets up more...
I'm not sure if I caught this right, but on the cash equity business, did you say it was up sequentially, pretty surprising given industry volumes were lower just I was curious if you guys gaining share or any particular initiatives anything you can buck the general industry trends.
And your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
Our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.
But I think the critical point to recognize here is we did increase our capital return this year and our minimum ratios through the stress test actually improved across the board, both the Tier 1 and RWA ratios but also the leverage ratio was up about 30 basis points.
Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Nomura.
Again, I think I tried to answer this question clearly not as well as people had liked.
Thanks, Jon. James, actually at the Morgan Stanley financials conference, you made a comment regarding loan penetration levels among some of your retail clients.
The 16% number actually struck me a bit high and yet we continue to see really strong growth within that channel.
",55.41,0.77332306
morganstanley,q3,2016,"While some of that benefit is related to lower revenues, the vast majority of the 200 expense initiatives identified internally are yielding results and will continue to be carried out through year-end 2017.
We also said we wanted to maintain the revenue footprint while reducing the balance sheet, the capital, the expenses, and the headcount in this business.
If you look not quarter-over-quarter but year-over-year around occupancy, around T&E around some of the professional services that $800 million I'm not going to go line by line there is some benefits from the fact that revenues are down a bit, but we feel confident that we're going to hit both or the $1 billion target which obviously includes compensation savings.
You had a great result in capital return but capitals buildings is this high class problem you have, I think you'd be at the high-end of your ROE target range now if you had a similar capital ratio to the peers and you're above 10 on a tangible so.
We have the GSIB buffer coming into play obviously there is going to be some netting against that, if I read the speeches right around the shape of the balance sheet growth and around whether one is told to buyback commitments for the nine quarters.
But this has been a multiyear restructuring, I don't think any bank has wanted to try and get ahead of the capital ratios given that all of the rules have not been fully baked in as Jon just said we're dealing with the Volcker dispositions that will happen and whatever extensions we get from June 2017 but obviously we got some dispositions going, we've got the GSIB buffer in action, the resolution plans are still working, working their way through, all the banks are resubmitting those, so there is a still a lot of moving parts.
We did take out 25% of the total headcount cost and people in December of last year and we're currently on track for the $1 billion run rate in fact a little above it but again we're not too focused on the quarter-to-quarter moves and I think the question underlying it is, the teams do something on the risk front which was sort of further standard deviations out from what we have typically been doing the last couple of years, I think the answer is clearly no.
And we can, Jon, will take you through some more details if it's more to add to it but this is the business which, as you know, and if you look at the street numbers, I think all of the banks surprised on the upside but it was a better macro environment, there was more volatility post-Brexit, there was more volatility around rates because of the Fed multiple talking voices of the Fed and the credit markets turned out.
Listen I think what we've generally said is that we feel very comfortable with our competitive position, you can see our ranking quarter-to-quarter share is sort of hard to look at because as James mentioned these businesses move around.
So we are seeing the benefit of being the number one in the world and I think you're going to see just like in many other financial services products the concentration of market share among the top players and that's what you're seeing in equity.
So we're going to continue to manage that business, we're going to continue to run those down overtime, and I think we're pretty close to the ultimate targets in that on our balance sheet perspective as it is today.
And at the low-end of the range that is 23.1% -- excuse me 23.2%, you should also recognize some seasonality in this business in terms of the expenses in the fourth quarter but again as James said and I said in my prepared remarks given the flows in managed money given the lending progress that we've made, we feel good about the margins and sort of the progress that we've made here.
And then I think in the past, you guys mentioned that you didn't expect any significant impact on revenue or expense meaning like the margin, so I just wanted to confirm that as we get more information and you guys continue to work on strategy.
Mike as I said, I think the team is going to be saying some here the next couple of weeks, so really to be fit, I don't want to get ahead of it, I will give you a lot of details.
And Mike on the second half of your question obviously there were drafts to the DOL rule out last year so we were informed when we gave you the 23% to 25% margin target.
And so just wanted to get a sense on you have more flexibility in terms of frontloading it and then when I think about I think Glenn had the question on just where the capital ratios and the ROE, you James, having too much capital definitely in this environment is a good spot to be, when you look at the global firms.
So when you look at what you guys are doing strategically in terms of focusing on wealth management, you're taking down some of the risk on the balance sheet is that starting to resonate with the regulators and so did you have the potential to get that CET1 ratio back I guess around the industry average -- versus at these elevated levels?
So for 2017 what James has said and what we said at the beginning of the year is that we were capital sufficient and we would like to try to return capital above the current levels that we have and we're going to continue to do that follow that strategy in '17.
We continue to look at inventories and manage those businesses and try to shrink where we can I mentioned that in my comments.
No again I think the way I would look at it is, we have been able to increase our capital return quite dramatically over the last several years and our ratios in CCAR last year ended up higher than the year before.
But again these things are going to bounce around quarter-over-quarter and we feel very good about the $1 billion target we set for next year.
So if you look at the 9% to 11% target, all right, what is the equity assumption underlying that relative to where we are today, is it continue to capital accretion and net income is just expanding ahead of that accretion or is it some expectation of reduction?
Well again I think when we laid out the 9% to 11% for 2017 in the beginning of the year, we said we had sufficient capital and therefore we wanted to try to maintain that capital level.
May be quick follow-up in the ROE targets the 9% to 11% next year you are sticking with this but as we look at the presentation from January you were sort of under the expectation that revenue growth would be 3% to 5% annually obviously year-to-date that -- we haven't hit those numbers.
Listen, I think we've shown some really good progress against the goals as you do mention the revenues are down '16 versus '15 year-to-date.
As I mentioned some of the flows and where we are in terms of our assets under management and our lending progress helps position our business for '17 continued leadership in equities and IBD where we like our positions in our global footprint.
I think CET1 clearly very strong but the SLR I guess is where if you look at your progress to-date, it's been not as rapid on the RWA side in fixed income is that what's driving the slower progress on the SLR and you still feel confident you can get to the targets?
Fixed income is on course for an annualized quarterly revenue run rate of $1 billion per quarter and project streamlines progress is evidenced in 73.3% efficiency ratio this quarter.
We remain on track to achieve our objective of reducing expenses by $1 billion by year-end 2017 on flat revenues.
Year-to-date non-compensation expenses have decreased by approximately $800 million or 10% versus the same period last year.
Further last year's restructuring of fixed income sales and trading continues to be a tailwind through the overall non-compensation expenses base.
ISG net revenues were $4.6 billion essentially unchanged on a sequential basis.
Compensation expenses were $1.7 billion and year-to-date our ISG comp ratio was 36%.
Revenues were down 12% versus the strong second quarter impacted by a lack of specific macro events, a muted underwriting calendar, and light volumes that are traditionally seen over the summer months.
Third quarter results were driven by continued strength in derivatives as performance was aided by a number of meaningful corporate transactions underscoring the collaboration and cooperation across our investment bank.
Other revenues were up versus the second quarter primarily driven by gains on our relationship and event held-for-sale loans as a result of an improved credit improvement.
Asset management revenues increased 2% quarter-over-quarter reflecting positive flows and generally higher indices.
Transactional revenues of $791 million this quarter were largely unchanged from Q2 but down sequentially when excluding the impact of mark to market gains on our deferred compensation plans as client engagement remains subdued.
Asset management fees for the quarter were $508 million essentially unchanged versus 2Q 2015.
Investment revenues in the quarter were $51 million essentially unchanged versus last quarter reflecting a more stable investing environment.

morganstanley,q4,2016,"The restructure in fixed income made a year ago was consistent with our objective to have a credible and critically sized business that was relevant to our clients and supported adjacencies that exist with our ISG and wealth management franchises.
The FedÂs actions in December and expected rate increased in 2017 and 2018 combined with a more positive investor sentiment lead us to believe there is real upside to the business over the next several years.
As you know, with Project Streamline last year, weÂve committed to reducing $1 billion of expenses by 2017, assuming flat revenues.
All three of our major business lines produced strong results with total net revenues of $4.6 billion, essentially flat to the third quarter.
In investment banking, we generated $1.3 billion in revenue, a 15% increase over the third quarter.
As you pointed out, you met a lot of your objectives for the year, and I guess it points to the question specifically in fixed income, given that youÂve maintained that target at $4 billion, or a billion dollars quarterly, and even in what was a terrible year last year, you managed 4.3, I think, and this year you did 5.1.
By the same token, looking at Slide 13 where you show 23% to 25% margin target in wealth management and then youÂve got a question mark on 2018 and 2019, it looks as if youÂve drawn the 2018 bar a bit higher, though.
Let me try and take that one, Guy. I think as you point out, the wealth business and the NII in that business is clearly the most sensitive to rates.
I think what weÂre saying for 2017 is that we still expect NII growth, albeit at a somewhat slower pace, and itÂs probably going to be more mixed in terms of where that comes from.
I canÂt exactly remember, but in the first quarter of Â16, I think the forward curve was showing maybe one or half a rate increase.
We said a billion dollars of expenses should add about 100 basis points of ROE, and therefore the revenue growth was going to generate the difference.
So again, I think in light of the last three quarters that weÂve put up close to $9 billion and sort of, as James said, on average about an 8.5% ROE, we see a clear line of sight to that 9 to 11, and we feel pretty confident about it.
Just looking at the business, the comp ratio did tick down slightly this year, about 50 BPs, so continuing to grind that lower, but admittedly the mix, particularly towards higher margin NII, would have suggested that maybe we should have seen a little bit more progress.
We would expect to continue to grow NII, not--itÂs obviously a bigger number and so growth rates will slow down, but we feel very good about the margin and the net interest income opportunity, and that will clearly drive an increase in our margin.
So you know, while we could probably accelerate the comp ratio decline, IÂm not sure that would be good for the medium and long-term growth of the business, which weÂre all focused on at the same time.
one of them was 3 to 5% revenue growth, one of them was continued progress on our capital return, because obviously ROE is a function of both the equity and the earnings, and the third was no one-time large enforcement-slash-litigation--you know, financial crisis-type events.
Obviously if thereÂs a very difficult revenue environment this year, we stand by our original predictions that weÂre subject to, and I donÂt think weÂre going to need to be at the 3 to 5% revenue growth to get there, but certainly if we had a negative revenue environment, thatÂd be a different issue.
Then as far as your progress in trading, youÂre gaining market share in equities for sure, and it looks like a little bit in fixed income.
The equity pool in terms of the revenue or the wallet looks like it will shrink for the year - we havenÂt seen everyoneÂs results yet, and we had the opposite phenomenon in fixed income where it looks like the pools have been getting a little bit bigger sort of quarter to quarter.
In terms of where that share is coming from, itÂs sort of hard to discern, but I would say one of the things that weÂve been very proud of and very focused on is keeping the global network intact as we restructured and changed our businesses around the globe, and I think that global network is accruing benefits to us as weÂve seen others around the globe sort of disrupted or distracted, based on the events going on.
So I get it that there is some uncertainty in the revenue environment, but you guys highlighted it seems like momentum continues to improve, specifically FIC looks stable, exceeding targets with lower capital, equities strong, and II starting to benefit from rate uplift, and risk appetite is expanding and transactional revenues are starting to improve in wealth management.
The second point I would make on your Tier 1, I think it was your CET 1 question, itÂs just around we had--our buyback and our preferred and common dividends sort of offset our earnings, and then you saw a movement in our AOTI.
Just a few on wealth management, and some of these are just clean-ups; but I think, Jon, you mentioned some expense items in this quarter.
You will see that in the results in the wealth management business, that weÂve taken that number from under $2 billion a couple years ago to $3.5 billion in NII, and we would expect that to continue to grow, and that will obviously help the margin in that business.
We donÂt think in the certainly short, medium, maybe even long term itÂs going to be a large part of our business - thatÂs not our presumption.
I guess the two parts of my question are, on the one hand, as long as the CCAR process exists, obviously there will be constraints on how much capital presumably can be returned in any given period of time; and on the other hand, youÂve sort of right-sized your fixed footprint and so itÂs now consuming less RWA than it has historically.
Clearly over the last couple years, our balance sheet has sort of been flat to down, but as we see some increased activity and client activity across the globe, there is an opportunity to invest that back into our core businesses, so thatÂs another area that potentially looks like there could be an opportunity this year, whereas I would say last year it didnÂt feel like we were in that same spot.
Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets.
On the beta question, thereÂs obviously been a lot of discussion around betas, mostly because weÂre now in an environment of rising rates where we havenÂt seen one in eight years, so everyone is sort of using models that are based on historical practices, and we obviously have seen also money market reform and some changes in the structure of the markets.
Again, I think itÂs very hard to look at net interest income in ISG, particularly the sales and trading businesses.
WeÂre actually trying to keep common equity flat, as we think we have sufficient capital to run our businesses based on the current size, shape and risk profile of the company.
Yeah, but if interest rates keep rising and if the impact is similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter, your common equity is going to continue to fall.
Our capital--our average equity was down $400 million, I think, quarter over quarter, so again on a roughly $70 billion base, it wasnÂt a dramatic decline.
First of all, Jon, in investment management, obviously the fourth quarter numbers were a little bit skewed by the loss, but first of all, can you tell us a little more detail as to why you took those charges, and in the bigger picture youÂre still above the 40% target for comp to net revenues in that business, and how confident are you, you can get to that by 2017?
They were investments that were made going on 10 years ago when we made the risk decision to exit those positions, and we did and sort of took the charge that you saw in the fourth quarter of $60 million.
In terms of the comp ratio, to be fair, as you know, carry runs through that line item, so the comp ratio target that we put out there, itÂs really quite volatile and I donÂt think weÂre going to--you know, depending on what the investment environment is, it sort of perverts if we have a lot of carry gains.
The one thing I will tell you is that if you look at--you donÂt have the ability to parse this through the different line items, but the non-carry related comp expense is actually down as a percentage of the fee-based revenue, so we are exhibiting good expense discipline in that business, but it will be volatile based on carry and investment gains.
No, IÂm saying weÂre going to continue to try to make progress in those line items, but--and we feel good that there are probably some more opportunities.
We have taken them down pretty dramatically from the 417 into the 340s, so we think there is still some optimization there; but we feel good about the size of this business and the results that its generated.
Good morning, this is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations.
On relatively flat annual revenues in Â16, we reduced non-compensation expenses significantly and continued to exercise discipline on compensation.
We also achieved record pre-tax earnings of $3.4 billion in the face of a number of macro headwinds, including sustained low interest rates and muted retail investor engagement.
Assuming normal market conditions prevail, as they did over the last three quarters when our ROE averaged 8.5%, we remain on target for our 9% to 11% goal for 2017.
This should help us realize the remaining savings potential in 2017 and maintain operating leverage in a rising revenue environment.
This includes deepening our relationships in prime brokerage as well as focusing on providing content, capital, and execution services to clients in flow trading.
Over the past few years, weÂve consistently increased our dividend and significantly increased our total payout to approximately $5 billion while also growing our common equity base.
We have noticeably reduced marketing and business development costs by actively managing discretionary spending combined with price renegotiations.
We continue to benefit from shutting down the two North American data centers and remain on track to close two additional ones last year.
Sales and trading revenues were flat sequentially, weathering seasonal trends, demonstrating strong and consistent performance throughout the quarter.
Revenues in the Americas has particularly strong growth as investor optimism and trading activity improved after the election.
Q4 revenues of just under $1.5 billion were seasonally strong and essentially unchanged from the third quarter.
The business reported asset management fees of $512 million and AUM of $417 billion, both essentially unchanged versus 3Q.
Our capital position remains strong.
We did this by improving our cost discipline and executing strategic initiatives, including our bank strategy and our fixed income restructuring, while retaining leadership positions in areas of traditional strength of equities and investment banking.
Recently, increased investor optimism and more constructive markets are positive signs for our businesses.
Clearly mortgage will probably slow down a little bit given the increase in rates, but SBL and the tailored lending product continues to show good growth, so weÂll see some average earning asset growth that will drive that.
YouÂd previously indicated at the last strategic update that hitting the 9% was really contingent on delivering mid-single digit revenue growth per year, and it looks like consensus is modeling somewhere closer to low single digit, so instead of your 3% to 5%, somewhere closer to 2%.
But given the significant progress youÂve made on the cost side, IÂm just wondering whether you can still hit the 9% even if revenue outlook materializes more in line with consensus.
Just wanted to get a sense as to what factors have impacted your ability to drive more meaningful comp leverage, and maybe how much incremental margin upside we could see from higher rates, alluding to GuyÂs question about the rising column chart in terms of margin progress beyond 2017.
Within that, IÂm curious if thatÂs just all-natural progression as youÂve basically doubled the fee-based assets over the last seven years, and where you think that natural resting ground will be as DOL may be coming into play in a couple months.
I think you did something along those lines in the 1Q fixed income presentation last year, so perhaps you can give an update on that.
Hi. There has been a lot of focus on the asset sensitivity within the wealth management unit specifically, but I was wondering if you could comment on how the overall balance sheet is positioned for rising rates, including the institutional securities unit and investment management.
You guys have made great progress on the FIC RWAs, I think almost at your end state already, well ahead of schedule.
",52.46,0.8377493
morganstanley,q1,2017,"TodayÂs presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
Other priorities included achieving a wealth management pre-tax margin of 23% to 25%, delivering on project streamline and improving results across our fixed income division.
These priorities were consistent -- were contingent upon modest revenue growth, a continuation of our capital distribution plan and the absence of any outsized litigation expenses or penalties.
Wealth management recorded a pre-tax margin well within our target range, and the fixed income division delivered revenues meaningfully north of our $1 billion average quarterly goal.
These public markers, combined with continued strength in investment banking, leadership and equities and improved returns in investment management, all contributed to one of the strongest quarters in recent history.
Given Morgan StanleyÂs very strong capital and liquidity position potential modifications could substantially impact us over the coming years.
Compared to the fourth quarter, non-interest expenses of $6.9 billion were up approximately $160 million or 2%.
This increase was driven by higher compensation expenses, which rose 9% sequentially due to higher revenues and the impact of mark-to-market on our deferred compensation plans across the firm.
Year-over-year revenues were up $2 billion while non-compensation expenses increased by only $100 million over the same period.
Our businesses built on Q4 momentum and produced strong results with total net revenue of $5.2 billion, up 12% quarter-over-quarter.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 7% sequentially driven by lower seasonal expenses, partially offset by higher execution related costs.
The increase was driven by strong underwriting results across both debt and equity, partially offset by a decline in advisory revenues.
Turning to underwriting, continued investor optimism combined with stable capital markets characterized by low volatility and tighter credit spreads, translated into strong underwriting activity in the first quarter.
While equity volumes are still well below peak levels, Q1 represented a more constructive new issue market with low overall volatility and fewer specific risk events.
Against this backdrop and with a strong pipeline coming into the new year, equity underwriting revenues were $390 million, up 73% versus the fourth quarter.
Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 26% sequentially to $531 million, driven by strength in investment grade bond and high yield financing issuance in attractive credit environment.
Now turning to Wealth Management .In the first quarter, we reported record revenues of $4.1 billion, representing 2% sequential increase.
We witnessed increased fee-based asset flows, additional lending, better client engagement and eliminate FA attrition.
Higher asset levels and positive flows were largely offset by the effect of fewer calendar days in the quarter.
The steady increase in fee based assets position us well to build our annuatized revenues.
Market appreciation and equities and fixed income, and positive flows and alternative products, contributed to a modest uptick versus 4Q16.
Asset management fees for the quarter were stable at $517 million.
Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $360 billion, down $10 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by lower operational risk RWAs. The reduction in RWAs contributed to a 70 basis point increased in our pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.6%, bringing it more in line with our pro forma fully phased in Basel III standardized common equity Tier 1 ratio.
Our M&A and underwriting pipelines remain healthy and macro events should continue to provide opportunities for our trading businesses.
May be a quick question on -- you guys seemingly loss but gave up little market share when you trim 25% of the workforce, but it's obviously a strong momentum.
Maybe IÂll try a little bit more color on FIG business, and obviously the great growth over the last four quarters.
In addition to the obvious uncertainties, there are two notable policy areas that could meaningfully affect us in a positive way in the next several years; first, the potential for reduction of the domestic corporate tax rate.
Importantly, we produced results characteristic of constructive markets and we controlled expenses, highlighting the operating leverage in our business.
As I mentioned earlier in the year, we had the capital capacity to increase our balance sheet if the client opportunities and returns justify the usage.
As James said in the opening, the strong results this quarter provide support that our strategy is working.
However, questions around timing and achievability of the new administrationÂs policy initiatives, resulted in more sporatic client activity towards the end of the first quarter.
The 2017 plan is we've had I think four or five years of dividend and capital increases.
On the regulatory front, there's huge moving parts, I mean -- and on fiscal policy; first the corporate tax rate, as we said, we have a large business that is almost entirely in the U.
S. financial system is demonstrably healthier than it was going into the crisis and in the years following, weÂve reached a point where the amount of capital burden and regulatory burden on the system and some of the elements of that and some of the lack of transparency elements are right for real change, and that has been acknowledged all the way from board members of the federal reserves on down.
But I think there are a number of very specific fixes that both relieve the expense and time consumption, now that the plans are relatively mature, without attracting all from the regulatory rigor that is necessary for strong and healthy banking system.
And do you think that that should continue to provide a nice tailwind on to the equities business broadly, just given the non-box approach.
And making it A, more consistent with the Europeans, I think there is also an argument by the way bringing the ratio, which is currently 5% of capital to the growth that balance sheet to the European level, I suppose 3%.
But I donÂt want to predict, and I'm pretty sure Jon doesnÂt either, on how that might affect our equities business and what that implies about our prime, so itÂs a little early for that.
And do you think that momentum in market share can continue given where you are currently?
And I think we feel confident that we will continue to be relevant to our clients, support other ISG businesses.
So broadly speaking, a good quarter for the businesses and the strength was pretty much across all products, except for really FX.
So want to kick things off with a question on CCAR in the capital stack, your CET1 ratio is clearly very strong.
And with the inclusion of the SLR in this upcoming test and also given the latest preferred issuance you announced, I was hoping you could just shed some light on how the introduction of the SLR constraint actually informs your thinking in terms of excess capital; and how we should expect you to manage the capital stack going forward, whether we should see some incremental pref issuance from here.
So I think that change in the second one was the balance sheets grow during the times of financial stress.
I guess the question that I have been now that is what kind of visibility might there be to reducing excess capital over time, quite apart from regulatory change, which is of course hard to forecast at this point.
We did continue to derisk the balance sheet over the course of the year, and fixed income and then you can see the results that we brought down capital in that business.
We increased our investment and the balance sheet this quarter, as I mentioned, in the sales and trading business.
So we continue to see roll down of long-dated stuff, but I think at this point, itÂs not really material and itÂs not really part of the management of the business.
I think if you're looking at the asset sensitivity or the net interest income in our wealth business, which is generally where most of the asset sensitivity is, a couple of things.
What we've seen now that we've been through three, I guess, rate hikes in the last year and change, is that the model data has been higher than what's actually happened, in terms of the deposit base.
But again, it's a model and we haven't really seen that many rate hikes over a long period of time, particularly given money market reform and digital products in terms of deposit behavior.
But our performance in wealth NII is strong and we still feel confident that we can grow that business, because of the lending products that we're offering to our clients, as well as the benefit of the forward curve this year and the potential for future rate hikes.
And we allocate liquidity to those business, so that sort of that dynamic there; but again we're number one; we feel very good about our position; our performance was very strong, particularly in Europe this quarter; its global; weÂve got a good product set and we feel very good about our position and our continued momentum there.
And our next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets.
And ultimately, do you think this kind of a risk for the business or do you see an opportunity for Morgan Stanley to take more market share?
Again, I think as you highlighted, itÂs been a good product and an important product for our clients.
",43.46,0.8663775
morganstanley,q2,2017,"TodayÂs presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
Investment banking showed continued strength, reflecting diversity of our global M&A and capital markets franchises.
Compensation expenses are in line with our stated targets and higher accruals year-to-date reflect higher revenues.
We also saw some seasonal increase in professional services, marketing and business development and higher volume driven expenses.
Net revenues across institutional securities businesses of $4.8 billion were down 8% sequentially.
The trading environment slowed from the first quarter, market moving events were episodic, volatility in many asset classes hit multi-year lows and activity was sporadic.
Turning to underwriting, our continuation of stable capital markets with low volatility and range down credit spreads contributed to another strong quarter for underwriting.
We expect activity levels to remain healthy although near-term issuance windows maybe impacted by macroeconomic uncertainties and a typical summer slowdown.
Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased 5% sequentially to $504 million, a market wide decline in volumes relative to strong first quarter was partially offset by market share gains across both investment grade bond and high yield financing.
In our credit businesses revenues were down quarter-over-quarter driven by lower levels of activity.
These results were achieved despite a normalization in activity following a strong first quarter as retail sentiment reflected the same uncertainties faced by our institutional clients.
Second quarter revenues were $4.2 billion a 2% sequential increase.
The PBT margin 25% slightly above our full-year 2017 target range reflected growth in fee based revenues and operating leverage.
Net interest income of $1 billion was up 2% over last quarter, that benefit a higher rates and lending balances was partially offset by lower deposit levels.
This reduction in deposits reflects both typical seasonal client tax payments and deployment of cash into the markets.
Lower compensation expenses were offset by seasonally higher marketing and business development and professional services expenses.
Annuitized revenue continue to grow with fee based assets and increased loan balances.
overall, AUM grew 3% to $435 billion driven by investment performance with particular strength across our active equity strategies.
We also saw positive flows across our equities, fixed income and alternative businesses with strong capital raising internationally.
First question on wealth management, I noticed the deposits down 7% I think, sometimes its seasonality and then sometimes itÂs cash deployment.
As such depreciate assets run off, new businesses not gathered, it would be hard to imagine in fact during the crisis in the years following of our own balance sheet obviously shrink dramatically both through our actions and through market activity.
Maybe an equity is trading here, weÂre six months away or within six months of method to in Europe IÂm sure there is lot of corporation at the firm right now.
In addition, there are three tailwinds worth calling out, each of which has the potential to impact our long-term performance in a material and positive way, capital, tax reform and interest rates.
Non-competition expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 6% sequentially driven by the UK VAT expense, as well as higher execution related costs due to a shift in business and geographic mix of client activity.
Historically, low volatility, a rally in interest rates over most of the quarter and fewer market events contributed to a slowdown in overall performance, while the revenue showed a sequential decline given the market backdrop, weÂre pleased with the results.
Wealth management lending in the U.S. banks grew by about $3.5 billion in the quarter or 6%, as clients drew on their SPL lines to manage liquidity needs, a trend we often witnessed in the second quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis total spot assets of $841 billion were up $9 billion and average assets were up $12 billion reflecting continued support of client activities within the sales and trading businesses.
After years of headwinds for the industry, we are finally starting to see some tailwinds that can be promising for our business in the long-term including the potential for tax reform, sensible regulatory change and a rising interest rate environment.
So thatÂs been a positive, weÂve also, if you go back to the first quarter, remember what the curve looked like, I think weÂve gotten rate hikes faster than we thought back then.
Can you give us a sense for the different business lines now that the business has been adjusted and can you also - I know you mentioned Jon that commodities were down sequentially, but was this quarter extraordinary from your perspective weÂve heard some mixed things from some of the competitors some additional color there will be great.
You know I think the way I would look at it is the results clearly just reflect the environment that we were operating in.
So, when we look at the individual product mix, as I did mention our rates business given the low volatility is down, yet our FX did a little bit stronger particularly in the emerging market areas.
So we feel good about the business, commodities are also down a little bit, less activity and a tighter trading band there, but the results reflect the moves and the changes that we made and the results reflect that the business is really starting to come together and jelling and I think we feel pretty good about the results in light of the environment.
So, wanted to started up with the question on wealth management and pre-tax margin, certainly encouraging to see that you guys eclipse the 25% target for the quarter.
IÂm just wondering as we look ahead to the second half, given a number of favorable trends for the business that Jon you had cited whether itÂs strong fee based conversions, healthy loan growth and NII expansion.
Right now, with the rates and higher markets those are good trends that will drive our asset base fees as well as our NII, our lending growth has been solid, I think the one area of potential volatility or softening is around transactional.
We saw really nice operating leverage here, we saw really nice growth across all products in the lending book and we feel very good about the results, I mean the PBT at $1 billion plus is obviously a record and itÂs a really important contributor to the overall franchise.
On the first part of the question I think clearly the reform around SLR would be helpful for a variety of reasons whether or not itÂs our binding constraint this quarter or next quarter is certainly not a foregone conclusion.
So there could be some benefit from that but we also think there is just general benefit with that calculation in terms of what it means for their overall sales and trading businesses.
But I do think there are several changes have been discussed or that are being discussed that would clearly help our position including around the balance sheet and how you think about capital actions going forward.
So I think itÂs a little early on 2018 CCAR to sort of have a prediction, but clearly we were pleased with the results, if you look back at year ago where we were versus what came out of the report a couple of weeks ago with a 100%ish payout and a 33% increase in capital return and a clean report weÂre very pleased.
I would just add on the leverage ratio, specifically, we have argued for a number of years and present to regulators for a number of years that the fact that a balance sheet growth during the time of financial stress is hard to understand how that happens.
So the leverage ratio constraint is made more acute by the fact that the denominator is growing at I think itÂs about 4.5% a year for the nine quarters.
But I donÂt think, the point of setting the target to establish, what we needed to prove to ourselves on an average run rate for the business to justify the expenses in capital balance sheet that we put behind it at that level.
You saw the RWAs bounce a little bit this quarter, that was consistent with sensible business growth, there was opportunity clearly Tier-1 capital ratio is another constraint or no way near it.
I think clearly, I think there is a general recognition from the regulators all the way through the treasury that the Volcker Rule as it play out overtime straight a fair bit distance from Paul Walker initially envisaged, which was a simple restriction on the amount of capital put into proprietary invest and proprietary trading and but then frankly constrained on the ability of institutions to make markets and effective market liquidity.
Maybe first here just in wealth management, youÂve recently outlined the digitalization strategy, which was very helpful and with respect to the [robo] (Ph) offering, it sounds like youÂre not going to be able to focus on the children of the existing clients and some lower balance accounts which does seem to mark us with this generation of wealth transfer coming here and where the money is going to be over the next several decades.
So as we think about that process, how do you protect against maybe some cannibalization of existing business as clients look at the lower price point.
You know I guess the question is a revenue opportunity here just much more of an offset or do you just not think this as something that would appeal to some of your existing higher net worth clients for a portion of their accounts, itÂs a just a different bucket.
We had the same issue last year around DFAS and people sort of concerned with our outcome and about 100% payout ratio continue to increased capital return, part of our core strategy.
And our view is that, the way we calculate our capital needs to run our business, we continue to have excess above that, but weÂre waiting for the outcome of the white paper and the various efforts from the regulators to see what changes take place, there are clearly going to be changes.
And the next question comes from the line of Gerrard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
The real story for us is as you mentioned has been in the wealth business as we continue to increase the penetration of our client base with lending products.
And we feel like weÂve got good momentum in the growth last quarter at $3.5 billion was pretty balanced across the business a little bit more skewed towards SPL and tailored versus mortgage given what happened in rates, but again that lending story we feel very good about, our levels of penetration of how many of our clients have lending products is still probably a bit below peer level.

morganstanley,q3,2017,"While the third quarter was impacted by the typical summer slowdown across many of our businesses, our results reaffirmed that we can generate solid returns against a more subdued backdrop.
These investments include not only our digital build-out but also further enhancements to our advisory platforms, lending cash management products and integrated, goal-based planning solutions.
Sales & Trading was impacted by the environment, characterized by a seasonal slowdown, muted client activity and low levels of volatility.
Fixed Income remained above our $1 billion run rate per our average quarterly revenue goal, and Investment Management exhibited steady performance with a combination of positive flows across our actively managed strategies.
Often an underappreciated part of our firm, Investment Management represents a high-returning business with a complementary mix of traditional and alternative platforms.
Incremental revenue is expected to generate higher margins, assuming we continue to manage our cost base with discipline.
Despite this somewhat uninspired trading environment, results remained solid with strong performance in Investment Banking and Investment Management and consistent revenue growth in Wealth Management.
Fixed Income underwriting revenues decreased 12% sequentially to $442 million, driven primarily by lower investment-grade issuance.
High-yield markets have continued to be very receptive to both acquisition financing and opportunistic refinancings, aided by range-bound credit spreads, low volatility and significant market liquidity.
In Sales & Trading, we supported our clients when opportunities presented themselves and prudently managed risk throughout the quarter.
Sequentially, Europe was weaker coming off a seasonally high second quarter, but continued strength in Asia buoyed our results.
And cash revenues remain stable as lower volumes and subdued volatility were combined with a more benign market-making environment.
Our macro businesses were negatively impacted by sequentially lower results in foreign exchange and persistently low levels of volatilities in rates, where client activity remain muted.
Lastly, average trading VaR for the period was $43 million, down versus $51 million last quarter, primarily driven by lower market volatility across both equity and fixed income markets.
Turning to Wealth Management, which reported further growth in both revenues and pretax profits relative to last quarter's record levels.
Our business continues to benefit from a shift towards an advice-driven model with a decreased reliance on transactional activity.
This quarter's results further underscored this trend as growth in asset management revenues more than offset the seasonal slowdown in transactional revenues.
Investment Management witnessed another solid quarter with continued growth in asset management fees and strong investment results.
We will continue to opportunistically evaluate tactical acquisitions across our Investment Management platform as we further grow this high-return business.
Maybe just on the Wealth Management side, you guys had very good growth -- sequential growth in deposits.
We have a relatively narrow but very productive active asset management business on the long-only side.
And when you think about balancing not only the payment for research but also the enhanced liquidity throughout European trading operations, how do you manage the potential impact of spreads through that enhanced transparency?
And maybe a broader question on how you're thinking about capital management and some strategic growth initiatives.
Incremental revenues will continue to drive margin improvement, subject, of course, to decisions to invest in initiatives that have the potential to further accelerate growth.
We continued to see signs of operating leverage across our business model, not just in Wealth Management, where it's most apparent.
Going forward, our focus will be on ensuring that the savings achieved to date are kept permanently out of the expense base in an effort to maximize operating leverage across all of our businesses.
Our year-to-date compensation to net revenue ratio was approximately 35%, in line with our target of 37% or lower.
We expect healthy activity levels in the fourth quarter, subject to issuance windows remaining open, which may be impacted by macro-economic uncertainties, geopolitical events and a typical seasonal slowdown at the end of the year.
We have continued to support our clients and have generated revenues in excess of the $1 billion goal for 6 consecutive quarters against a variety of market backdrops.
Fee-based asset inflows were $16 billion in the quarter, contributing to a record year-to-date flows.
Higher asset levels and strong quarterly flows contributed to asset management revenues of $2.4 billion, representing 4% growth relative to the second quarter.
Net interest income of $1 billion is up 2% over the last quarter, reflecting the benefit from both higher rates and lending balances.
Wealth Management lending in the U.S. banks grew by about $1 billion in the quarter or 2%.
Continued strength in loan production offset the impact of higher paydowns in the quarter.
With year-to-date net interest income of $3 billion, up approximately 19% year-on-year, we remain on our way to generate full year NII growth in line with the guidance we had provided.
This quarter's performance clearly demonstrates the strength of the franchise and the powerful combination of a highly annuitized revenue mix and the operating leverage that comes from a scale platform.
We continued to enhance this business profile by investing in our advisory platforms, digital capabilities and banking and lending products.
Can you discuss where you saw deposit rates in Wealth Management business and how you were able to attract, I think, about $10 billion sequentially on deposit franchise?
So we've built out those products, particularly around our cash management engaged initiatives around savings products as well as CDs and other products to sort of supplement our deposit base.
We did, at the end of the second quarter raise our rates across the platform in the broker deposit channel.
And maybe, just the follow-up, just on your asset management acquisitions, you've got sort of a new tone, I guess, or more aggressive tone about further acquisitions.
I think there are a bunch of areas across the asset management platform we could continue to build out.
So I think what we're signaling, and Jim, you're picking up on it, is we're open for business to find inorganic pieces that can help build out parts of our platform that make sense.
I think in terms of stickiness, as James has mentioned and I have mentioned, we are seeing more of our clients engage with us on the advisory platforms.
Number one, we are the #1 equities business globally with a sort of -- with an integrated platform and a leading research product.
And maybe a question on the margins inside Wealth Management, obviously a big number this quarter.
I guess, that's sort of the early question around, ""Are we going to change our margin targets or whatever?"" Listen, the incremental dollar revenue is coming on with an incremental higher margin than the embedded margin.
And what the management team in that business is doing is looking for ways in which we can drive further growth over the next several years rather than trying to grind out a particular margin in a particular quarter.
We still have some, given that we've just raised the deposit number from the $144 billion to $154 billion, we do have excess liquidity today to continue to fund lending growth going forward.
We do -- we would like to continue to build out this cash management engaged initiative, which should bring in savings deposits, some mix.
And especially in light of DOL implementation likely to be delayed and potentially tabled, how should we think about the pace of fee-based conversions from here as that seemed to provide a nice tailwind to some of the acceleration that we saw in recent quarters?
Number two, as we continue to build out the goals-based platform, as we continue to build out digital and our other services, I think our clients are attracted to the value-added proposition of a managed account and we see that trend continuing.
Well, again, I would say that we've seen continued growth in the lending product across Wealth Management across the 3 products, mortgage, securities-based loans and tailored product.
Based on market data, it suggests that our penetration rates are lower than some others, so we think that we continue to have room both on the SBL and on the mortgage product.
We've hit that each quarter; efficiency ratio driven by Project Streamline of 74% expense to revenue, and we've been below that for the 3 quarters; Wealth Management margin, 23% to 25%, and we're now operating above that level; and the fourth, of course, was the Fixed Income division's revenues, which we thought, given what the team did with the restructuring in the fourth quarter '15, I think it was, we thought that the business model stood on its own with about $1 billion in revenue.
I don't think there's a lot of point in trying to nail ourselves to a specific revenue target for a business as volatile as that.
I guess I step back and I think that your businesses are higher expense-based in general, but you also have leading market shares in a lot of what you do, have been executing well, as you pointed out, in getting the efficiency ratio down, you're exceeding your plan this year.
Wealth Management is obviously higher because of the payout structure in that business, but it's been grinding lower over time as non-compensable revenues come onstream.
The non-comp expenses in Wealth Management, I think, Jon, were down a little bit this quarter on significantly higher revenues.
And I think what you're going to see with every $1 of incremental revenue, you will still see a higher incremental margin coming on even with those investments.
As I said, we saw a lot of engagement with our clients with the cash and money market balances going down.
",45.29,0.8667608
morganstanley,q4,2017,"Page 3 of the strategic update shows our reported results and our results adjusted to exclude the aggregate impact of net discrete tax provision in the fourth quarter that resulted from the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act and other intermittent net discrete tax benefits unrelated to the Tax Act. These adjusted operating performance metrics will be utilized throughout the remainder of this presentation in order to assess our strategic objective established in 2016.
Looking forward, with these targets achieved and a solid strategy in place, our management team will continue to work towards generating sustained high returns by investing for growth while maintaining fiscal vigilance and capital sufficiency.
Slide 9 shows as we look forward and outline areas for organic growth and further operational improvement.
This lending growth is supported by a high-quality deposit base, which is sourced predominantly from our existing Wealth Management client footprint.
At the same time, we continue to optimize our expense base while still investing in future growth initiatives, including our digital offering.
Transactional activity, historically a more volatile source of revenues, has been significantly reduced and offset by growth in net interest income and fee-based revenue.
Slide 13 summarizes the future growth and margin opportunities in Wealth Management.
This target was premised on an expectation that we would be able to grow both net interest and noninterest revenues while maintaining expense discipline.
Achieving this revised target will be dependent on executing on a number of revenue and expense initiatives that are outlined on the right-hand side of the page.
Recall that we expect the margin to be positively impacted in excess of 100 basis points as the Smith Barney retention notes will be fully amortized by January of 2019, also at the same time we will continue to invest for growth.
Investment Banking, it had its best year post crisis, driven by strong performance in all businesses, including our ECM franchise, which ranked #1 globally in a resurgent underwriting market.
Slide 16 outlines our Investment Management business.
As I've noted before, Investment Management represents a high-returning business with opportunities for future growth.
As illustrated, a meaningful portion of our revenues come from businesses such as alternatives, high-conviction equities and emerging markets.
Approximately 2/3 of our 2017 gross sales have come from outside the U.S. Strong positive net flows from these markets represent a differentiated contributor to assets under management growth.
The examples outlined at the bottom of this slide illustrate that funds with differentiated strategies and strong investment performance tend to deliver significant AUM growth.
Optimizing our expense base has been a key driver of this approach as demonstrated by the multiple efficiency ratio targets we have set for ourselves over the years.
The increase in capital return has been executed while we've concurrently invested for future growth and maintained adequate capital levels.
Whereas the impact to the overall economic backdrop and activity levels within our business segments will only become clearer over time, we expect an immediate positive impact to our financial results in 2018.
So Slide 21 summarizes our key strategic objectives over the course of the next two years, and they include, delivering a Wealth Management pretax margin of 26% to 28%; expanding our ISG penetration and leadership across the businesses; positioning Investment Management for growth; and finally, realizing a firm efficiency ratio of 73% or better.
Together with an attractive capital return profile, the fulfillment of these targets will enable us to continue to drive ROE growth higher.
This management team is committed to executing on our strategy while looking for compelling growth opportunities in order to bring these objectives to fruition, which will provide both future profitability and performance.
Corporate clients, however, remained active, driving strong results in Investment Banking.
We have remained disciplined around compensation, achieving compensation ratios for Institutional Securities and Wealth Management below our targets of 37% and 56%, respectively.
Net revenues in our Institutional Securities business of $4.5 billion represents a 3% sequential increase.
Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion, bringing our full year compensation to net revenue ratio to 35%, an approximate 200 basis point reduction compared to 2015.
Looking at the full year, Investment Banking results benefited from the broad-based rebound in underwriting activity.
Our full year revenues were approximately $8 billion despite much of the year being impacted by historically low equity volatility.
Credit results exhibited stability against a favorable backdrop for risk assets, and our lending businesses continued to be a source of stable revenues.
The expense leverage has enabled us to maintain a substantial level of investments into our future capabilities, including our digital, banking and advisory platforms, while at the same time increasing our margins.
Full year NII growth of $576 million or 16% was driven by an increase in average loan balances of approximately $10 billion and higher rates.
In 2018, we would expect NII growth to slow based on our anticipated funding mix and higher deposit betas than we experienced in 2017.
Our AUM of $482 billion in the fourth quarter grew 8% with positive net flows across all strategies, including strong seasonal flows in our liquidity business.
As James discussed, we continue to see increased investor interest for strategies where we deliver differentiated value and strong investment performance.
Or put some numbers around it or somehow help us think about what you're efficiency target means in the context of that change.
You guys have done a very good job in increasing your market shares, particularly in trading and equity trading, even though the total wallet size has declined.
So I think you're right that there are probably a couple of institutions that would move forward in these businesses more aggressively than the last several years would suggest.
And I'm just wondering like as you step back, can you think about kind of the new regulatory environment, global growth picking up, what other areas are you thinking about strategically investing, maybe one you wouldn't before?
Investment Management is still an area that we'd like to continue both organically and inorganically look at opportunities; and if something comes around, like the Mesa West, which was a good cultural fit, good product fit and fit very nicely into the franchise.
But Wealth Management in recent years, it's certainly been helped by your strong expense discipline.
But level of engagement with clients across the complex, as James mentioned, the 10-year now backed up over 20 basis points in the last 2 weeks.
So on the NII within wealth, you -- as you know, we've actually grown that line pretty dramatically over $2.5 billion in the last 5 years, so averaging about $500 million per annum.
As illustrated in this slide, our primary focus in the early years was to put the troubles of the financial crisis behind us and to complete the full integration of the Wealth Management business.
Additionally, we will look for ways to realize the potential of our Investment Management platform, leveraging our attractive business mix, global client footprint and top-tier performing strategies.
We've witnessed material growth in our two main sources of annuitized revenues, fee-based assets and client liabilities, which produces, of course, net interest income.
In Equity Sales & Trading, we maintained our #1 position for the fourth consecutive year, with a wallet share in excess of 20%, allowing us to maintain revenues of approximately $8 billion despite a smaller wallet.
In Fixed Income Sales & Trading, we've gained share while resizing our business to one which is both critically and credibly sized and more appropriate for the wallet opportunity, and it generated more revenues than prior to the restructuring.
Going forward, our goal is to continue to drive efficiencies across the businesses and maintain a ratio below the 73% level.
As a result of our significant U.S. earnings contribution, not least here, our Wealth Management segment, we expect to see a meaningful reduction in our effective corporate tax rate.
That said, given our growth initiatives, maintaining expense discipline and recent changes to U.S. corporate tax law, we are increasing our target ROE range to 10% to 13% from 9% to 11% over the medium term.
For the fourth quarter, total noninterest expense was $7 billion, a 5% sequential increase, driven by higher compensation expense on higher revenues and seasonally higher marketing and business development and other expenses.
The 460 basis point increase in our pretax margin achieved over the 2-year period provides the best illustration of the success of the project.
Fourth quarter revenues were $4.4 billion, a 4% sequential increase contributing to a full year revenue growth of 10%.
Higher asset levels, combined with strong flows, contributed to asset management revenues of $2.5 billion, representing 3% growth relative to the third quarter.
The full year compensation to net revenue ratio was 55.6%, in line with our target.
On a full year basis, asset management fees increased 6%, in line with the growth in our average AUM.
In terms of numerator and denominator, as we said in the past, we think we're capital sufficient, and we'd like to continue to increase our capital return over the 2-year period that we talked about that.
But we're pretty confident, based upon our business mix, our presumed corporate tax rate, taking into account there's still a lot of questions around that, and where the global economic growth is that we will generate above 10%.
Again, it's going to be a function of activity levels and expenses related to deals, which is what's driving the biggest change, but sort of in that 40 basis points, which is about $400 million plus or minus both to the revenue and the expenses.
We got to -- a lot can happen in these markets, and I don't think we serve anybody well by just focusing on our margin.
And I think that's also going to lead to some of the growth momentum that we have in the margin and in the revenues.
So again, I think the betas are going to start to look a lot more like our expected modeled betas of about 50%.
I think -- what I was suggesting was, given what's going on in the business, the bottom end of that range, we think, is very doable and we should achieve it.
In my recollection, and maybe I'm wrong, but I think there's only one firm in the history of the Wealth Management business, and I'm aware of its size, that has generated margin above 28%.
That said, we put the range out there because that's what we think we will achieve over these 2 years.
It remains -- I don't think a lot is going to change in 2018.
And then, yes, if we got some serious change, we think, as an institution, we're over capitalized.
And frankly, on a global basis, I think there's a lot that would support that.
One, that there was a lot of operating leverage built into the system if it began to grow again, and then one that I think James made during the strategic presentation to the effect that -- and it sounded like you believe that, at this point, the wallet could expand, I guess, on normalization of vol or something.
I think what we're seeing in fixed -- what we said in Fixed Income was, if we couldn't generate on average and we fully expected we'd have quotas that wouldn't meet the average, in fact, fourth quarter didn't meet the average, but on average, $1 billion a quarter, we had a real open question about whether we've taken the right strategy when we downsized 25%, was it enough, was it too much, et cetera, et cetera.
On average, for two years now, for 8 quarters, we've generated $1.25 billion, I think, on average.
I think we have one quarter in there maybe a year ago where it's around $1.7 billion.
And we think that in an improving market, which again, early days, if you just look at the 10-year, if you look at rate expectations or [indiscernible], they've all picked up a little bit here.
We think that we are investing at the right level for our businesses, but we don't know that.
If we have good revenue growth and invest behind the business and still keep our efficiency rate under 73%, that would be a terrific outcome.
So just given the range of the 22% to 25%, just -- how are you guys thinking about all that drop to the bottom line versus reinvesting in the business and the employee base over time?
So again, I think people feel pretty good about the global growth picture, and we see significant client dialogues and engagement.
",44.48,0.78069806
morganstanley,q1,2018,"This activity combined with the rise in U.S. interest rates and changes in inflation expectations contributed to strong fixed income results.
Investment management again witnessed net long-term inflows over the quarter as the team continues to produce strong investment returns across both alternatives and public markets.
Global markets were active, our institutional securities businesses benefited from increased trading volumes and a return of healthy volatility across many asset classes, while wealth and investment management businesses delivered solid results weathering softer asset prices.
The increase was driven by a combination of higher compensation expenses and execution related costs associated with higher revenues and business volumes respectively.
Turning to underwriting, new issue market conditions were more challenged during periods in the quarter, despite doubts of heightened equity volatility, rising interest rates and wider credit spreads, results remain solid.
Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 4% sequentially to $518 million.
A combination of higher client balances and increased engagement generated a sequential rise in prime brokerage revenues.
And cash revenues also saw quarter-over-quarter increase benefiting from strong volumes globally particularly in Europe and Asia.
Fee-based assets continue to be a source of long-term organic growth for the business supported by both conversions from brokerage and net new asset flows into the firm.
Net fee-based asset flows of $18 billion were strong.
Asset management revenues were $2.5 billion.
Lower suite deposit balances also impacted NII as retail clients have continued to deploy cash into the market.
Retail engagement was strong in the quarter as investors actively repositioned portfolios and responded to market volatility.
Although we saw outflows in our liquidity business as clients manage their cash balance needs around the turn of the year, our long-term strategy saw continued positive flows.
Invested revenues were $77 million, down by 31% relative to last quarter, impacted by lower market performance in certain private equity related funds.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Nomura.
As a very comprehensive response, I will switch over to the business side specifically wealth management, itÂs certainly encouraging to see continued robust fee-based flows, improvement in pre-tax profitability probably the one area that maybe fell a bit short of our expectation was NII driven in part by slower loan growth.
The good news is that we still capture those assets when they go into advisory accounts and other transaction-related accounts, but it has brought down our sweep accounts and we have replaced those with higher cost deposits and you are seeing that on the net interest expense line item.
So yes, I mean again within fixed income there are lots of businesses macro and micro corporate trading commodities are within our FPG business, a larger percentage of that that line item over time will be coming from these lending activities.
ItÂs been a good risk return profile with healthy yields and very strong credit characteristics.
For the quarter, the combination of continued advisory growth supported by secular trends and the businesses scale driven operating leverage produced record pretax profit of $1.2 billion.
We have often said that wealth and investment management give us balance and our other businesses make up the engine that drives this going forward in more active markets.
In institutional securities alone, the dominance of equities, the strength of fixed income and the breadth of investment banking generated over $6 billion in revenue.
In investment banking, we have generated revenues of $1.5 billion, a 5% increase over a strong fourth quarter.
Our sales and trading businesses produced revenues of $4.4 billion, up 64% quarter-over-quarter, increased market activity, strong client engagement and more favorable bid offer spreads particularly during the first half of the quarter drove the improvement in results.
Turning to wealth management, revenues of $4.4 billion were down 1% quarter-over-quarter as continued growth in asset management was offset by the impact of mark-to-market un-deferred compensation planned investments.
So I was hoping to just unpack James some of your comments surrounding the recent proposed changes to capital regime, as we think about the capital constraints that you are looking to manage to longer term, historically you have been a bit more leverage constrained, we now have this enhanced SLR and SEB proposals that are out there and there are some expectation that risk based ratios could once again become a bit more binding.
Historically, you are right, our constraint has been our leverage ratio itÂs been Â I think are constrained on every tests going back and maybe not the first one, I canÂt remember exactly, but I am pretty sure.
I know you had spoken if some of the factors, including the migration of mortgage originations in-house, but how should we think about the outlook for loan growth in the coming year and maybe against the backdrop of rising funding cost, how does it inform your outlook for the NIM trajectory from here?
I think what we have talked about coming into the Â throughout last year as well as coming into this year was a couple of factors that we suggested would slowdown NII growth in this segment and thatÂs what we obviously saw this year or this quarter excuse me.
So, we will grow probably at a slower pace for the reasons you highlighted the transition and sort of rising rates, but we still think thatÂs healthy growth on a $70 billion portfolio.
Is some of this funding that you are doing for CDs being used to fund some of the institutional loan growth, whatÂs the plan for how long that would stay on the balance sheet and does this provide a pipeline for some DCM activity here in the coming quarters?
So, the follow-up would be then I would expect that at least what was certainly volatility supported some of the trading strength here this quarter, there is also some annuitized component to some of the revenue strength here in trading that sits on the balance sheet and another component which you might not have touched upon, so I want to try and get out it different way, is the CD or is the CD is being used to fund this and are those deposit costs being born in the NII line in wealth, but not necessarily getting the benefit of the NII and so itÂs just a geography issue, so we are all going to Â my focus on the wealth NII, but you really are generating economics this is not pulling through that line?
Just a question historically the whole industry, but Morgan Stanley specifically had big seasonality in the first quarter, I thought a chunk of that had to do with the physical commodities business which is no longer there, but putting aside that this was a more active first quarter in general, you talked about securitized products, you also talked about some structure transactions and commodities, I know itÂs an impossible question, but should we be expecting seasonality of the past given that the higher activity levels and those specific components this quarter?
And generally speaking though, if you look back over 5, 10 years of first quarter has generally been seasonally strong, particularly in ISG sales and trading and whether thatÂs just because people have new money to invest or they are repositioning for the year or the start of the measurement period in terms of their performance, but there generally has been real seasonality in sales and trading.
So, I think the range of this firm is kind of a worst case scenario without the market completely imploding around $7.5 billion a quarter.
So, thatÂs what we are playing for is the sort of balanced and then the speed obviously in a good market, the seasonally strong market, an active market, which we had in the first quarter slightly lower tax rate, slightly lower preferred that we have every other quarter, then you are going to be at the highest end of Â or towards the higher end of your ranges.
The other question I just wanted to pick up on that was something that Jonathan mentioned in his remarks was the concept of the bid offer which was up very strongly in the early part of the quarter, I guess across a wide range of products and I would just be interested in a little bit more color on what you saw, where you saw it and in terms of products and areas and to what extent should we think that this has probably normalized already?
Hi, this question might do on the category of no good deed goes unpunished, but you have the biggest gap between your return on equity and your targeted return on equity, so the fact that you are not raising estimates or targets yet, I guess it could be because itÂs seasonal or you donÂt extrapolate some results because of something you see or because you compete away the tax benefits or you just want to be super-safe especially after your first couple of years and CEO, James, you got started, but you missed a couple of targets and now you are exceeding them and you are exceeding them by wide margin, so why not increased target?
So, when we put in a target range, we donÂt anticipate firstly we would never change it after one quarter and you wouldnÂt expect us do it, so itÂs I think we called it a medium-term range, so I think about those for a couple of years.
Again, I think from the overall credit quality, there is a couple of components, one is obviously mix, a good portion of that or itÂs the vast majority of the wealth management loans, virtually all are secured in one way, shape or form whether that be via house or our bigger portfolios around the security-based lending where we have good LTVs and good data protections.
Jon, can you share with us your thoughts on you talked about the mortgage production and moving it in-house may have contributed to some of the slower growth, but I know itÂs early, but your clients tend to be obviously higher net worth type of clients.
As rates rise, we will also see presumably less runoff, but again we feel good about where we are in terms of the lending growth slower first quarter, but as expected.
Jon, you guys generated good operating leverage in the quarter, comp ratio lower, just on the non-comp side, we expected somewhat with just the activity, but maybe just some color on whatÂs being driven by activity versus what you guys mentioned on the investments in wealth management like what we should be expecting is more ongoing?
And then just as a follow-up on the capital ratios in the stress capital buffer, I just wanted to give or take given that it will be more variable or volatile going forward, do you expect some more transparency in the calculation of the test and if you get that then can you better manage like the current kind of portfolio in the business to maybe navigate that better over the next few years and I know itÂs early, butÂ?
Good morning, just a follow-up on that, you guys, James as you said you have built more stable you think stable kind of revenue producing business model you had when we look at the stress test, you get hit the hardest in terms of starting point to stress minimum in terms of loss rates that seems, it doesnÂt seem to jive with what you have built and just therefore you get hit hardest in this SEB even though you have plenty of capital.
Some of that this year is going to be a function as you know are of significant portion of our revenues in wealth comes from our fee-based flows and if your markets are down 65% and they donÂt ever recover, that obviously has an impact on our business.
On the wealth management side, just want to follow-up on the NII questions, I guess just to wrap it all up, how should we think about sequential quarter progress going forward, should we be thinking about growth for Q1 base and also if you have the deposit, the brokering deposit number for the quarter that would be helpful also?
Sure and again the way I would describe this first of all I think you have heard James talk a lot about this business being balanced, so itÂs not going to move quarter-over-quarter sequentially very much, thatÂs why we like it a lot, it sort of grinds it out.
Just had a quick question on the wealth management space, we saw that the reps were down 1% year-on-year, I mean going forward is that just the right way to think about your advisors in that business, there is going to be a declining based from here or will there be a some point we can actually see growth in advisors?
",35.28,0.6588649
morganstanley,q2,2018,"The segment generated a pre-tax margin of approximately 27%, while continuing to invest in the business.
Going forward, we expect to be able to continue to invest in our business and offer our shareholders an attractive capital return while maintaining a prudent capital base.
Year-to-date revenues were $21.7 billion, a firm record after excluding the impact of DVA in prior periods.
Continued strength across investment banking, equities and fixed income has contributed to year-to-date revenues of $11.8 billion, our strongest first half of the year excluding DVA since 2007 and a 19% increase versus the same period last year.
In investment banking, all products and regions performed well, generating revenues of $1.7 billion.
Revenues were $4.3 billion for the quarter as continued growth in asset management was offset by slowdown in transactional revenues.
Year-over-year, revenue has grown 13%, driven by continued strong investment performance and positive flows, particularly in our active fundamental equity and multi-asset strategies.
All of our businesses are positioned for growth and to support our clients if activity levels remain high.
How about -- on the net issues income front and wealth management, I think down sequentially for two quarters.
So, good growth year-over-year, which I think is a better metric to look at.
And we do expect to continue to grow NII in that sort of 4% to 5% range, which is where weÂve been growing it year-to-date.
Again, certainly in the wealth management channel, the new CD promotional rates and savings rates have been for new money, as you said and weÂve seen really good uptick on that.
So, weÂre going to continue to see this trend of a diversification away from the sweet deposits, which are lowest cost funding source into some of these more higher cost products, and thatÂs what really is going to drive interest expense going forward.
I think itÂs a little premature, I mean, not to duck the question, Guy. But weÂre still on the comment period.
And I think everybodyÂs kind of taken a little pause on that and trying to figure out what is the right level of capital you need in the financial system to fund the economic growth and whatÂs right leverage of the institutions.
So, I think, as I said in the opening comment, weÂre in the transition period.
The bottom line is where weÂre distributing I think thatÂs $6.8 billion of capital through the first six months of this year, I believe weÂve had earnings of $4.8 billion.
I guess, first question here just on the retention loans and wealth management where I think the balance was $3.6 billion at last quarter.
And IÂm just trying to kind of think about the moving part here because I know itÂs important to the kind of the forward margin story.
It sounds like itÂs across the business but just a little bit of more color there and just confluence of moving parts that you mentioned on trade retentions and Brexit.
We have risk weighted assets in fixed income of I think $380 billion; we had a balance sheet of $1.2 trillion; we had capital of $30 billion.
As to where weÂre making changes, obviously, the investment in technology and thank you for the comment about the tech expo the folks did is real.
ThatÂs not trivial; that is a real evolution within both, wealth management, the trading businesses that weÂre very focused on.
The potential for growing revenues in asset management given the diversification of the base, the range of products and the alternative space and the traditional space and the performance of that business is real.
The share gains that weÂre seeing across banking, equities and fixed income is real thatÂs happened last year, and itÂs happening again this year.
All of those things are real, and the bank and what weÂre doing with the deposit strategy and also respecting the questions that came earlier around net interest income, the bank will remain a very important source of growth over many years; and then, our geographic repositioning, particularly in Asia where weÂre investing stronger than we need to for example in the U.S. So, a huge amount going on.
So, if you had 80 years of change in the last eight years, I guess my follow up is your appetite for deals, your appetite to more aggressively reallocate capital to fewer areas, I think youÂve kind of answered that but -- or maybe tax spend, are you looking to ramp up, how much you spend on that?
But the most important thing is we just see a lot of growth across our businesses and a lot of our opportunity for share gain, and thatÂs what weÂre focused on.
Corporate lending is generally a relationship in the bank weÂve seen particularly on the commitment side, continued growth in that area.
But broadly speaking in the ISG business, weÂve seen good, attractive investment and growth opportunities.
But, itÂs not going to be a big area of growth and thatÂs not where we try to generate excess returns.
Just wanted to give your sense, when that starts to come on line, like what youÂre seeing and like what are the goals in terms of bringing in new clients, new assets, improving efficiency over time.
And although weÂve made significant investments and have that lot of technological change within the business, these trends are going to play out over a significant number of years.
And then probably more importantly, just how youÂre thinking about managing risk, because it does seem more consistent than a lot of the peers in the industry?
But I think our expectation is that there will be some changes here coming forward.
Number one, I think Jon hit on something very important that the sort of equities profile of the wealth management business is suggestive that itÂs more volatile than our actual business is because of the scope scale weÂve built in and the other sources of revenue.
I think, you said something like wealth management NII growth, you expected 4% to 5% kind of yearly growth.
So, is the right way to think about that youÂre going -- the capital ratios should be increasing over the year or irrespective of client activity?
And if there are opportunities to support clients and invest that capital into the business at a good return, weÂll do that.
TodayÂs presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
Investment banking and equities reported very strong results and fixed income continued to perform well.
Each year, the test has become increasingly more demanding and in fact has yielded results significantly more severe than what we and many other banks experienced during the 2008 global financial crisis.
Investment banking performed very well as new issue markets remained open and receptive to corporate strategic activity.
Equity sales and trading was buoyed by active global markets and fixed income benefitted from strong client flow.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.9 billion for the quarter, a 4% sequential increase, driven by higher professional services expenses.
The results represented 12% increase versus the strong first quarter.
New issue market conditions remained favorable in the quarter with significant investor demand across both equity and fixed income, supporting strong underwriting results.
Equity underwriting revenues of $541 million were up 29% sequentially as favorable backdrop allowed us to convert a strong IPO backlog and convertible activity also remained robust.
Fixed income underwriting results increased 4% sequentially to $540 million with stable results across both high-yield and investment grade issuance.
Whereas the effects of U.S. tax reform and rising rates have weighed on investment grade flow issuance, this has been more than offset by increased strategic financings.
Prime brokerage revenue saw sequential increase, aided by seasonal factors in Europe and stable client balances.
Fixed income continued to perform well with quarterly revenues of $1.4 billion.
Net fee-based flows remained strong at $15 billion, contributing to record fee-based assets of $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client assets.
Net interest income was $1 billion for the quarter, down 2% sequentially, driven primarily by lower prepayment amortization gains.
This increase was partially offset by outflows in the quarter, primarily driven by tax season and continued market deployment.
Whilst lending in the U.S. banks grew by 2% to $70 billion in the seasonally strong quarter as client choose their SBL lines to manage liquidity through the tax season, year-over-year, loans have grown approximately 8%.
A flatter yield curve has also shifted clients investing into shorter duration products at lower commission rates.
Our sources of annuitized revenues continue to grow with consistent fee-based flows and record balances for both fee-based assets and loans.
Additionally, we believe our investments to create a modern client and FA experience supported by integrated digital capabilities will enhance growth and further operating leverage over time.
Investment management witnessed another solid quarter with a continuation of positive long-term flows.
Our Basel III standardized common equity Tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios are expected to increase to 15.8 and 6.4% respectively as we accredited capital in the quarter.
Our first half results have been strong with two consecutive quarters with revenues greater than $10 billion.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore.
And itÂs generally been redeployed mostly back into their investment accounts in both fixed income and equity.
WeÂre out testing a new every day cash management product right now in a few complexes.
You had some really good loan growth in the institutional securities bank data on slide 12.

morganstanley,q3,2018,"Investment banking benefited from continued strategic activity and new capital formation globally.
Wealth management delivered another solid quarter and investment management saw continued positive long term net flows although investment results were impacted by weaker emerging markets.
Investment banking reported revenues of $1.5 billion down 14% relative to the second quarter reflecting a normal seasonal slowdown in activity.
New issue market conditions remained favorable in the quarter supporting strong underwriting results.
Activity remained healthy across products and regions with particular strength in IPOs. Americas were strong throughout the quarter while Asia and Europe saw some seasonal slowdown in August before a strong September.
Increased results in investment grade issuance partially offset a slowdown in high yield financing relative to a very active second quarter.
Event driven transactions remain a significant driver supported by the active M&A backdrop and our ability to leverage our global franchise to provide holistic client solutions.
Fixed income revenues of $1.2 billion were down 15% versus the second quarter.
Total client assets of $2.5 trillion is up $85 billion or 4% compared to last quarter as markets showed gains and clients continued to add new money to their accounts.
Net fee-based flows also remained strong at $16 billion contributing to 3% growth in fee-based assets which now stand at $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client assets.
In addition to the traditional decline in retail engagement during the summer months, we saw clients continue to focus more of their fixed income investing into shorter duration products at lower commission rates.
Investment revenues were $40 million down 27% sequentially impacted by continued market volatility in FX and emerging market equity performance.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
There was a comment in your press release on institutional securities that the other sales and trading net losses were down quite a bit versus year-ago reflecting lower net funding costs and I was just wondering, I mean it was a big enough numbers that itÂs meaningful and it sounds like a great thing but how do you reconcile that with higher interest rates?
Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
The first half of the year was characterized by strong market environment and increased levels of client activity.
Year-to-date revenues of $16.7 billion are up 17% versus the same period last year benefiting from active global markets, increasing revenue pools and stable to improving wallet share.
Sequential revenues declined across each business line as the quarter was characterized by low market volumes and more subdued volatility compared to the first half of the year.
Year-to-date results demonstrate that we can steadily grow this business while continuing to make investments into tools to support asset growth, increase client engagement, and improve cost efficiencies.
In investment management, we saw continued positive long-term flows $3 billion in the quarter supported by strength in overseas distribution.
On a year-to-date basis, asset management revenues are up 13% on strong investment performance and positive flows particularly in our active fundamental equity strategies.
My first one is on deposits, they've been definitely in focus for the wealth management side and I know you gave some comments on that Jon, thanks for that, but we had the first wave I believe of CDs, your CD program that was scheduled to mature over the summer, so it would be great if you could maybe let us know what sort of customer behavior you've noticed with that money and what portion of that cash are you retaining and what kind of products are customers moving into with that cash?
We have seen a little bit more of a shift into the fixed income investing than we did probably what we saw in 2017, but all in all it has been sort of both a nice way to supplement liquidity in the bank, but also bring in new assets to the firm.
It sounds like itÂs off to a good start this quarter, but as you look at the stock it's obviously been under a lot of pressure this year and I think its concern over the sustainability of revenue.
This firm is positioned for resilience through cycles, thatÂs exactly what we demonstrated in this quarter, to deliver $9.9 billion of revenue in a summer quarter that was unheard of a couple of years ago.
But in a normal downtick in the market, yes we pick up some volatility and then over time our revenues would trail off a little bit, but the fundamentals are very strong.
And I think the other concern obviously is the capital deployment and the results from 2018 CCAR, but it seems like youÂre addressing that or trying to building capital, I donÂt know if that was simply the Â what's going on in the market or specifically response to the CCAR results if you could comment on that and then if there is still further optimization that you can do to the CET-1 after going up 90 bps this quarter?
But I canÂt imagine a scenario over the next several years where we donÂt have significant buyback programs just because we are accreting so much capital and weÂre Â and unless you can find ways to invest that in the business to generate those kinds of returns, I think it is shareholder friendly to have a strong dividend, have strong buyback and make the appropriate investments to build growth into the business.
In the fixed income space we have picked up share over the last several years since the restructuring which is why weÂre so confident that the position of the business is in such good shape.
We expect to continue to maintain and grow our share given the stability and the momentum in the franchise and itÂs always going to be a competitive market.
I guess as a quick followup, given the volatility that weÂre seeing in like the EM and Asian markets start 4Q, can you give us an update on what how this impacts your business maybe specifically in IM or itÂs like the investment line?
As I mentioned earlier the investment line was impacted this quarter because of some of the volatility in both the rates in emerging markets.
But I think again thatÂs the sort of the tail on the dog, the primary driver of revenue growth for us in that business is going to be around the fee-based assets and we continue to see continued good flows into our long-term assets.
So, yes I would say, I mean modestly I wouldnÂt there is not some massive jump likely across wealth and asset management in a flat market environment, but there is definitely operational improvements that can be made.
So I just wanted to start off with a question on equity market sensitivity and James it was interesting to hear your perspective on some of the factors weighing on the stock and maybe some of the underappreciated revenue stability.
I mean listen, we had a more challenging third quarter, both from market activity and just seasonal volumes and we delivered an ROE of 11.5% in that environment, so and tax adjusted that's probably [10% to 0.25%] [ph] for what it would have been last year.
So we're not as correlated to equity market movements as I think is sort of believed if you actually look at the stability of the franchise across each of the businesses.
I was just wondering from your perspective, how you think about balancing the need to continue to deliver margin improvement versus some of the higher investment needs as you look out to other growth opportunities?
I mean, there's obviously operating leverage in a business that has the scale that we've got across wealth management, across the prime [brokerage] [ph] space, the core large investment banking businesses the incremental dollar revenue is coming on at a much higher rate than the embedded dollar revenue across all of our businesses.
Under the current thinking around the SEB structure, our balance sheets would not grow, that obviously makes both intellectual and intuitive sense, and secondly I believe that the capital what you would be required to continue to distribute would be just dividends for one year.
If I could just maybe ask one thing unrelated to capital, just on the - I think there has been a lot of concern about NII growth from here, is your sense that at least could you update us on kind of the pick-up in yields in growing the loan book versus the securities portfolio as you kind of see that loan growth, should we expect and margin can continue to move a little higher?
I think the last quarter we mentioned that we saw NII growth in the 4% to 5% range for the year, we are still comfortable with that.
Remember a lot of the young clients don't have as much wealth as our older clients, so it's going to be a slow build, but we continue to make the investments in the digital strategies and the stock plan program to be able to position ourselves to bring in more assets over time.
And then just a followup here would be maybe good to get a little bit more perspective on just the investment banking activity levels in the various businesses and then clearly, some concern in the market just around kind of being late cycle.
That was really a function of just a lot of activity in the third quarter and we expect to continue to sort of rebuild those pipelines and be active in those markets.
We have seen a little bit of consolidation with MiFID going into places people to reduce the number of counterparties they deal with, but I think the general comment was generally the top providers, top three or top four or top five depending on the market where the products have generally been gaining share and we would expect that trend will continue.
",45.93,0.75687027
morganstanley,q4,2018,"Regarding Investment Management, it's fair to say we are positioning the business for growth, but it's still early days.
In the future, subject to regulatory approval, we expect to increase our capital return while simultaneously investing in our business for growth.
We believe that the stability of our team and business model compared to an industry, much of which is still going through change, should enable us to continue to take market share.
Shifting the page to Investment Management, as we noted last year, Investment Management is a business positioned for growth and we're executing on that opportunity as evidenced by strong growth in our asset management fees since we refocused our efforts on Investment Management in late 2015.
Within the year, we saw patches of over-performance as well as underperformance, obviously, in the fourth quarter.
Lastly, while not a point of growth, we reiterate that given our business mix and model and our capital base, we will look to achieve 100% payout ratio going forward, subject obviously, to regulatory approval and any acquisition opportunities that may come our way.
I'm going to now turn the call over to Jon, who will talk about the fourth quarter in detail, the annual results, and then, of course, we'll take your questions.
Our Institutional Securities business reported revenues of $3.8 billion in the quarter, a 22% sequential decline.
Sales and trading and underwriting results were both impacted by violent market swings at the end of the year.
Volatile market conditions, including the severity of intraday and intraweek movements, impacted performance in cash and derivatives in the fourth quarter.
Wealth Management finished a strong year on a weak note, impacted by the decline in asset prices and the impact of market volatility on investment banking revenues.
Over the last several years, the impacts from our employee deferred compensation plans have had limited impact on both revenues and pretax margin, but this quarter, losses on deferred compensation plan investments had an outsized impact of over 5% to the revenue line.
The growth in annual revenues and the limited increase to non-comp expenses while still investing in the platform highlight the business' extraordinary benefit of scale.
Higher asset levels at the end of the third quarter helped insulate these revenues against the market decline in the fourth quarter.
And on a full year basis, Asset Management revenues increased 9%, a function of higher fee-based client assets driven by markets and flows.
Given the number of factors that can distort any individual quarter, we continue to manage this business with a long-term lens.
Asset management fees of $628 million grew 4% versus the third quarter, driven by a significant amount of the year's performance fees being recognized in the fourth quarter.
The first question I wanted to ask was just -- I recognize that, in Wealth Management, there were some moving parts that had to do with two different deferred comp programs, one being the one that affects both the expense and the revenue lines equally, and we've seen that before.
It obviously brings up your comp expense and affects the -- and given that's an adjustment for the full year, the fact is hits in one quarter affects that quarter disproportionately.
And again, over a long period of time -- excuse me, over the annual basis, the deferred comp plans have generally been pretty -- have not really impacted the PBT, but we did obviously see a 14% decrease in the S&P in the quarter.
And within Wealth, based on the mix of how those employees invest their assets and the deferral schedules, you saw a bigger revenue impact there.
In any one quarter -- and I would -- as I mentioned in my script, if you take those as well as the seasonality as well as some of the volatility we saw in the Investment Banking or I guess, in the calendar revenue, which you can see in the supplement, the margin would have been closer to the full year margin, had those impacts not occurred.
So, we plan all of those, and if we can drop in a series of -- sort of string-of-pearl type acquisitions across the platform while we're driving organic growth in the actively managed, which is the higher margin business, get better scale in the fixed income platform and do this over a period of years and not look for a single answer but a series of answers, I think there's a lot of space in there.
You guys referred to this a couple of times, and James, I believe you referenced how you all made a change to the deferral schedule for comp a few years ago, which was also to bring in line with peers.
I think, Brennan, that's a fair question, but to be totally clear, I mean, the change we made several years ago was a big deal.
It's just something that given obviously the disappointing sort of sticker at a price numbers of some of this stuff; it affects things like the margin in Wealth Management because, as I said, $40 million, $45 million is a point of margin.
I certainly don't see it as the B, which is the Morgan Stanley of old, if you will, the sort of episodic volatile shifts, overdependence on propositions, big marks, misplaced trades, major integrations going on at the same time, selling businesses, writing stuff off.
The year averaged at about $1 billion in a quarter, but yes -- no, that was not a good result.
As we said, we put up $5 billion of revenue in each of the last three years in a shrinking market, so it's not the business of old.
As I said, we had good client activity, part of facilitating our market-making businesses standing in between flow.
And again, we think it's a real nice opportunity over the medium to longer term to bring in more clients and more assets into the business.
And then, I guess, specifically within the Institutional Securities, you've had really nice market share gain in the investment bank as well as across the trading businesses the past couple of years.
We make thousands of incremental business decisions that drive expenses every day, and yes, that is something we will be hyper focused on as we get through about the first half of this quarter and get a better sense of where we think things are really heading.
And then with that volatility, as we're entering 2019, it will be great to get a little bit of perspective around the dialogue with clients, either on the equity issuance side, where I think there's been some enthusiasm around potential for IPOs this year and then also on the M&A advisory side as well.
Since some of the volatile like line items -- when I think about the Institutional Business, like the other line that credit flows through, investment line that was negative and then even the deferred comp, was there anything in the fourth quarter that was more like realized losses versus mark to market that if the market continues to stabilize, we would expect some normalization there?
And we just want to continue to build-out and obviously, doing deals in wealth and asset management is a completely different ball of wax than doing them in trading businesses or in banking businesses.
So, I think going into the quarter, we felt very good with the book that we had or the exposures we had.
And we feel very good about sort of that book of business and being able to bring that to market, assuming these conditions continue to hold.
It probably outperformed our expectations a little bit although again our expectations was it wasn't going to have a material impact on the business.
Our clients like most products and we would expect to continue to grow them going forward.
By design, the increased contribution to firm-wide revenues from these sources should help support a base level of profitability during periods of extended market disruption.
Our existing strong footprint in Institutional Securities, coupled with our growth initiatives, will position us to capitalize on this expected regional growth and wealth creation, particularly as capital markets become a more important source of financing.
Scale advantages don't improve the story, resulting in a material increase in average sale in revenues over time.
Higher average daily revenues, supported by scale and the added benefit of U.S. tax reform, have improved the segment's contribution to the firm's net income.
Across our business lines, we're seeing strong investment performance while managing client partnerships and distribution and continued product innovation.
We will continue to focus on driving further operating leverage and increase expense management.
Namely, sharp losses to the investments associated with employee deferred compensation plans had a considerable impact on transactional revenues in Wealth Management.
Although these factors are not material to the annual results, adjustments can be amplified in any given quarter and impact the segments in slightly different ways.
Non-compensation expenses of $1.9 billion increased 8% versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by execution-related costs and seasonality.
Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion declined modestly from the prior quarter, consistent with lower industry volumes.
Advisory revenues increased 44% versus the third quarter.
Sequentially, equity and debt underwriting revenue saw declines, consistent with lower new issue volumes in both products.
Fixed income results for the quarter were weak against a challenging market backdrop.
Both seasonal factors and increased economic uncertainty related to growth and rate outlooks for 2019 and beyond influenced markets, resulting in rapid movements in spreads and asset prices.
Full year results highlight the business' operating leverage.
Asset Management revenues were unchanged versus the prior quarter.
Total client assets of $2.3 trillion in the fourth quarter decreased 8% sequentially, reflective of broader market movements.
Total U.S. Bank deposits of $187 billion increased 7% versus the third quarter, driven by higher deposit sweep balances.
Net interest income of $1.1 billion increased 2% versus the prior quarter and 4% over the full year.
Increased lending penetration, the adoption of digital tools, fee-based asset flows, and minimal attrition indicate an engaged financial adviser population and a business positioned to grow.
Investment Management reported revenues of $684 million, a 5% increase sequentially.
This increase was a result of the revenue recognition accounting rule change implemented early this year.
Other revenues were impacted by an impairment of a legacy, non-controlling interest in a third-party asset manager.
Although the asset pricing witnessed at the end of the year will have an impact on first quarter results, markets have settled into tighter ranges and historical relationships that broke down in the fourth quarter have realigned.
Our first question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.
And then maybe how you think about investing in that business versus say buying back stock at book value?
I heard all your comments on equities, but -- I know we won't get numbers, but in general, could we -- could you comment on like how much client deleveraging and lower volumes impacts things versus trying to stand up and facilitate for clients and just taking some hits along the way when the market is falling like a rock?
Part of reengaging is having products to buy, so new issue coming to market, the banking calendar being a positive.
Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.
Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Why don't I start on this and let Jon talk about how to think about the Institutional Business and expense management versus growth.
Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
I guess first question here just on Brexit and the uncertainty that's been increasing over there and just how we should think about either risks to Morgan Stanley around potentially personnel movements or maybe indirect, just related to kind of how you guys are thinking about the outlook for the institutional business given that uncertainty is pretty high right now.
Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.

morganstanley,q1,2019,"In the first quarter, our business has produced solid results and rebounded from the fourth quarter's market dislocation and idiosyncratic events.
Across the board, ROE, ROTCE, the firm efficiency ratio and Wealth Management margin are in line with or at the higher end of our strategic objectives, ensuring a very solid start of the year.
Institutional Securities generated revenues of $5.2 billion in the first quarter, a 35% sequential increase.
Non compensation expenses were $1.8 billion for the quarter, a 3% decline from the prior year.
In Investment Banking, we generated revenues of $1.2 billion, a 19% increase relative to the fourth quarter, after a slow start momentum and confidence picked up.
Strong non-compensation expense discipline and the benefit of the retention note roll-off more than offset the effect of lower asset values, resulting in a margin of 27.1%.
As we have mentioned before, as a result of the revenue recognition accounting rule implemented in 2018, a significant amount of any year's performance fees will be recognized in the fourth quarter with a small amount being recognized in this first quarter.
And again, we continue to see opportunities and levers if needed, in those sort of more controllable, if you will, line items like marketing and business development and professional services.
We did also see, as you would expect, year-over-year, a decline in some of the execution related expenses given the decline in revenues, but again, a nice quarter for us on the expense side, 71% efficiency ratio, well below our target of 73.
We also then saw over the course of the quarter, increasing build up of the pipeline in the IPO product.
I mean, the bottom line, the business has scale of point margin on $4.4 billion of revenues, $44 million.
And the first quarter was just shows the benefit of scale and our ability to pull levers and sort of manage between growth and investment.
Question on just what to expect, even though you can't expect too much, on fixed seasonality in the first quarter, I'm sure is as strong as ever been, you put a very good result.
And then on the flip side of that, in equity trading, I think public volumes are overall light, but my question is, what are you seeing on reengagement of PB client balances on margin?
As I mentioned in the call, a nice rebound from a disappointing fourth quarter and the business.
Sort of fit into capital, I mean, now that you've kind of taken a look at the new, the fast scenarios, how are you feeling relative to last year with respect to the CCAR submission?
I think you saw in January what we said is, and we continue to say we have sufficient capital, and we would like to return 100% of our earnings going forward.
So again, we feel very good about the mid single-digit guidance on loan growth and NII, even though, clearly, expectations around rates and the forward curve are different than when we started the beginning of the year.
And we -- as you saw what happened in those line items, the second one on other sales and trading you mentioned or just other?
But as James mentioned, this is really a scale business and we have the ability to really manage that expense base tightly.
Again, I'm not, that's obviously huge given just the size of the business, but that may make down some numbers around a little bit over the next couple of quarters.
And one of the real exciting things about the Solium deal is our ability to use those digital investments more broadly with this younger demographic and this sort of emerging investor, demographic, as people build wealth in the workplace.
I mean, it's a -- I think it's a very interesting strategic play that will play out over a number of years and puts us squarely in the space we want to be in, but at a small.
That is the main game, driving the margins in that business, shifting the assets on to new types of platforms, building out the banks and lending products.
I mean, I think, first and foremost, I would just say one of this has been less movement of people both in and out and that's good for stability of the platform, the ability to build relationships and continue to invest, so that's a positive.
And those three lines, other revenues, other sales and trading, investments, I think you have to look at the broadly in context and then we try to call out what we think the biggest drivers of the changes are.
We also saw that's where we have a lot of our hedging activity, and obviously, spreads tighten, so there were losses there on the flip side and the other revenue line.
Obviously, we're just looking at one quarter here, and you're optimistic on the revenue outlook.
On the ISG side, you saw the comp ratios sort of consistent with last year's first quarter.
We want to be competitive in compensation and retain and attract the best people and we think we have the flexibility to do that within the context of the of the comp ratio in that business.
But if again, comparing year-over-year, we've been investing in the business, and in terms of both people and comp levels.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
In our Institutional businesses, client participation and balances steadily improved alongside confidence and asset prices.
Our Wealth business absorbed lower fourth quarter asset levels and delivered strong results.
Broad client relationships have driven net inflows in our global equity strategies, where long-term performance continues to attract investors.
On a year-over-year basis, total non-interest expenses declined 4%, even as we continued our investments.
Consistent with our objective to investment growth, we announced our intent to acquire Solium Capital, a leading global software provider for equity administration, financial reporting and compliance.
Through Solium, we gained a new scalable channel and direct sales force getting us the ability to target another client population, particularly a younger demographic and its wealth accumulation phase.
On a combined basis, we will now have direct exposure over 2.5 million individuals by Solium's workplace services, complimenting the other three million wealth management clients, our financial advisors already served in our traditional business.
As all of you know Colm was the Chief Financial Officer during the global financial crisis and was critical in helping navigate the firm through those challenging times.
Clients took time to regain confidence, and industry volumes declined impacting our ISG businesses.
Lower asset values at the end of 4Q impacted Wealth Management and Investment Management fee revenues.
Revenues of $10.3 billion declined only 7% year-over-year compared against the strongest quarter in the firm's history ex-DVA.
We remained committed to funding investments to tight focus on our more controllable expenses such as marketing and business development and professional services.
Compensation expenses were $1.8 billion, resulting in compensation to net revenue ratio of 35%, consistent with last year's ratio.
We saw an increase in bond issuance volumes across investment-grade and high-yield, while our leveraged loan activity remained muted.
CEOs remain engaged the global equity pipeline has built through the quarter, particularly IPOs, and market volatility is subdued.
Revenues in 1Q were $1.7 billion, more than doubling weak fourth quarter results.
The market was generally characterized by tightening credit spreads, declining interest rates, low volatility and uneven client activity across business lines as well as benefits from structured client activity.
Tightening credit spreads and increased secondary trading activity resulted in higher client revenues.
We saw increased velocity over the balance sheet in the quarter Commodities had strong broad base results with solid trading performance and lower structured revenues in Q1 '18.
Despite lower starting asset levels, the business produced the PBT margin of 27.1% demonstrating resilience despite large market drawdowns in the fourth quarter.
Asset management revenues were $2.4 billion.
Net interest income growth of 3% to $1.1 billion was primarily driven by the benefit of the December rate increase and the corresponding impact on our investment portfolio yields.
Total expenses increased by 3% quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher carry compensation, which offset a decline in non-comp expenses.
Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets of $876 billion increased 3%, driven by client activity primarily in equity sales and trading and ISG lending.
Pipelines are healthy in Investment Banking, and higher asset levels will support fee-based revenues in our Wealth Management business.
James, I know you've referenced it and provided some high level context around how you're thinking about it strategically.
But maybe -- could you help us think about how you see this fitting in a bit more granularity in the different businesses?
I was just wondering if you could provide any inside into how much of that fee strength that we saw in Investment Management, transactional activity in Wealth and other sales and trading is sustainable.
We have a $17 billion revenue business in Wealth Management that has nothing to do with Solium right now.
As you know, most advisors now work in teams, and we've gotten a very good program in place to help them transition their book of business to a younger member of their team and continue to retain those assets, even though people are leaving the business or retiring.
It's a strategic question regarding your technology investment, especially given that you've already locked into acquisitions like Solium Capital.
",54.46,0.8397104
morganstanley,q2,2019,"Our year-to-date efficiency ratio of 71%, below the 73% target, reflects our commitment to managing expenses tightly given the risk to global growth.
While results do have the potential to be lumpy in this business, obviously, to put the growth in perspective, revenues over the last 12 months are up nearly $900 million since full-year 2016.
We continue to invest in the business, and looking forward to sharing more about Investment Management in the months ahead.
In addition to increasing our return of capital to shareholders, we were able to invest in the business and completed the acquisition of Solium in the second quarter.
Focus on our more controllable sources of spend, particularly marketing and business development and professional services continues to help self-fund our ongoing investments, including at the technology, workplace enhancements, and the integration of Solium.
Now, to the businesses, Institutional Securities generated revenues of $5.1 billion in the second quarter, a 2% sequential decrease.
In Investment Banking, we generated revenues of $1.5 billion, up 28% sequentially, with advisory, equity, and debt underwriting all improving versus the first quarter.
We now expect NII ex-prepayments in the third quarter to be largely in line with the third quarter of 2018 with potentially a more material impact in the fourth quarter if the forward curve is realized.
In terms of the actual deposits, remember there are three buckets that sort of impact NII which is really the mix of deposits, the rate profile, and then obviously the balance.
In terms of our deposits we saw about $10 billion of outflows in BDP, some from lager tax payments as we mentioned, some other just as people continue to look at their cash as an investment vehicle and they've seen some higher yielding alternatives, but they are still pretty defensive.
The one thing that we would say on the deposit side that was positive is that the replacement of those $10 billion of deposits, although at a higher rate, were primarily driven from our wealth channel, so we had a lot of demand for our different products as we continue to build out that product set.
We've seen post the tax payments, probably the last five or six weeks of stabilization in those deposit levels, but again customer behavior, the forward curve, what happens to rates and the competitive dynamic will drive ultimately that outcome, but I think we feel very good about the deposit products that we've been rolling out.
Another point that we had -- questions we had heard from investors on the back of the results were around the mark in Investment Management that seemed strong again this quarter.
And so the forward curve has sort of by July 30 basis points, but September I think around 50, and then almost three full cuts by the end of the year.
And what happens to actual betas will be, as I said, a function of really sort of the competitive environment, what alternative investments look like, and what not.
That's not GAAP, it's helpful for the fixed income business, if it improves people's view of the world that there were going to extend the economic expansion, and people want to press that view in the equity markets, it could obviously help in the PB activity levels, it could also lead to repositioning of portfolios, which we haven't really seen a lot of.
My second one, sort of bit of a nerdy accounting question here, but in the release, you kind of mentioned in other sales and trading, revenues increase due to a shift in funding mix and balance sheet composition, I also think in the Q.
And I know we've talked before that James, you can always take it higher, but there's a trade-off between investing for growth and making sure you have the revenues coming in over the next several years?
The reality is, Mike, as you know, the incremental dollar revenue in that business comes on with a much higher margin than 28% today.
So there's almost no way in which you can, if we are growing revenues, you're not going to grow that margin in the business unless you have some sort of, operating issue, et cetera.
In other words, if the stock market stays at this higher level what impact would that have on the pre-tax margin in the third quarter?
Again, we would expect given where the market closed the prior quarter that asset management fees are going to go up in the third quarter.
First question just on wealth management and customer engagement, the transaction activity has been muted even with markets at highs and that's normally not the case.
We are at all-time highs in some -- in the market levels, but I think as I mentioned earlier, there seems to be a lack of conviction around that in terms of both where is it going from here and given all the uncertainty around the rate profile as well as the growth profile, I think the retail investor is inundated with information every day.
And what we've seen in our portfolios is sort of a little bit of a defensive posture in the sense that there is a decent chunk of the investment assets in short dated fixed income securities more so than we've seen in the last couple of years.
And I know on this call and in June you had cited your ability to really support high levels of investment and wealth as you noted and the higher incremental margins that each additional revenue dollar that's coming through all, what that supports in terms of improved profitability.
I guess if I look back over the last five to six years a lot of the pre-tax margin expansion has been facilitated by stronger growth and higher margin NII.
And as we look to NII now becoming a headwind versus a tailwind, do you think beyond 2019 you can still hold the line on that 26% to 28% or does the pressure on the NII revenue source in particular impact your ability to really sustain that level of profitability?
So it's not what drives the numbers it's not just NII, we've had there are lot of moving parts in here more money going to annuitize the accounts, the average velocity on those accounts, I think is about 20 basis points higher than the transaction accounts and that's for both fixed income and equity accounts.
So that is the guidance on the third quarter and as you know mortgage prepayments is going to be impacted by the rates in sort of the five to 10 year shape of the curve and so I just gave you guidance ex-prepay if that those numbers go down dramatically, you'll see the prepayments hurt us and if they go up you'll see a reversal of the prepayment.
And right now it's just some of that's just really a function of whether the assets in each of those accounts are growing faster or slower because the composition of those two buckets are little bit different brokerage versus fee based, but we do still think that that number will increase over time.
Maybe just a quick follow-up on the equity front, I hear that you are number one in maintaining share, but in PB I think you mentioned something -- or actually ask the question of are client balances also muted just because market keep hitting high?
Yes, again I think any given quarter is just a very short timeframe to look at, but I would say our PB business is obviously is very healthy and very strong.
I mean -- well, we have clearly seen lower levels of leverage finance activity which is a higher margin business.
In investment grade, it's a little bit lower but still pretty healthy, but yes, sort of the chunkier, higher margin stuff is really going to be sort of the delta if you will in those numbers.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results to differ materially.
Despite the challenging environment, Institutional Securities' results were solid, with aggregate revenues over $5 billion.
Our Equity Underwriting franchise performed well, and continued to bring new companies to markets.
Higher asset levels and strong loan balance growth more than offset the effects of lower interest rates.
Investment Management had very strong second quarter results.
Moreover, increased net long-term inflows should aid asset management fees going forward.
Despite lower completed M&A industry volumes, advisory revenues increased 25% quarter-over-quarter to $506 million.
Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 3% sequentially to $420 million despite lower industry issuance volumes in investment-grade bonds and leveraged loans.
This represents a decline of 34% from a seasonally strong one quarter which had significant structured activity compared to a more challenging backdrop this quarter and limited structure activity revenues.
While credit complex results declined sequentially, they were strong by historical standards driven by securitized products performance.
Commodity revenues declined quarter over quarter on lower trading results.
Asset management revenues were $2.5 million.
Total bank lending ended the quarter at $74 billion, increasing $3 billion from 1Q on strong growth in SPLs and continued progress in mortgages.
Other revenues were $120 million, increasing 48% sequentially as a result of realized gains from our investment portfolio.
Investment revenues of $247 million were driven by continued strong performance across our private funds including in our private equity Asia, real estate, and infrastructure businesses.
Market-related growth and positive net flows across all of our asset classes drove the higher long-term AUM.
Asset management fees of $612 million were essentially flat to the first quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets rose to $892 million as we continue to support our clients.
Wealth Management's fee-based revenue should benefit from higher asset levels, and investment management remains focused on growth and delivering increased value to clients.
",48.98,0.78140205
morganstanley,q3,2019,"Fee-based client assets and lending balances continue to build in wealth management, contributing to a 28% margin.
A $2.6 trillion of assets annualizing over $17 billion in revenues and margins at historic highs, the business is clearly stabilized in the firm.
This segment made $5 billion in revenues and for the fifth time out of the last seven quarters, and it underscores the strength of our client franchise in all three lines of the business, investment banking, fixed income and equities.
Overall, we remain cautious today as trade talks swirl and interest rate paths continue to be debated, but expect us to look beyond the next few months and focus on continuing to enhance the stability of the franchise and growing the business.
All of that said, I donÂt want to take away from the strength of the quarter and IÂll now turn it over to Jon to discuss the results in greater detail.
As we continue to invest in technology, workplace enhancements and the integration of Solium, we remain focused on controlling more discretionary expenses, particularly marketing and business development and professional services.
The business produced a PBT margin of 28.4%, while continuing to absorb expenses related to technology investments and the Solium integration.
As we look ahead, weÂre cognizant of the seasonal patterns of the fourth quarter, but we are encouraged by client engagement and activity levels and are off to a good start.
What sort of confidence do you have that revenues will grow faster than expenses, if not just for the quarter, but for the next year and how are you thinking about that relationship?
And youÂre right, in any given quarter obviously, youÂre going to see bumps and bounces a little bit.
And while we are having to -- and wanting to spend on some of the new technologies that are obviously coming to the market, weÂre also taking costs out from what has been a legacy system that hasnÂt been terribly efficient over the last 20 years.
So, I think, IÂm not going to give you an expense ratio number now.
And as you point out Brennan, I think,, the commission activity of buying and selling stocks and bonds in our wealth management business is a very small percentage of that business, and obviously, half of that for the whole Firm, given that itÂs less than -- itÂs about 40% of the firm wealth management.
I mean, at the level, the clients are paying, I think itÂs in the mid 70 basis points, Jon will correct me for advice on dollars of assets.
And in terms of the economics and how we think about this business, it was really to get access to a younger and different client base.
I think, IÂve argued for a long time publicly and privately that a simple leverage ratio is a constraint when itÂs not looking at what is the intrinsic quality, and liquidity of the asset on the balance sheet does not make sense, levering illiquid security versus a treasury.
And we think that youÂll continue to see consolidation of share in that business, and thatÂs an opportunity for us.
We were pleased with the flows and we continue to think that weÂre very-focused on attracting both new assets, and weÂre continuing to see that secular trend of people wanting to convert their accounts into the fee-based format because of the services provided and the value proposition.
When we look at the global market, weÂve grown share over the last couple of years and itÂs stabilized over the last year or two in sort of the 21% share type numbers.
WeÂre not going to see the lockstep jump that weÂve seen historically, but there are share consolidation going on, particularly in the cash market.
And I think the build out of the wealth management which is -- was clearly part of that strategy, build out of asset management of strategy and the stabilizing revenues within the institutional business as weÂve gone away from the prop trading and the more volatile parts of the fixed income franchise.
And, I think for 4Q, given that weÂve already had two rate cuts last quarter, the benefits of the higher loan growth -- or excuse me, the higher loan balances as well stabilization of the BDP will be more than offset by where rates are, in terms of the absolute level.
If NII is moving lower, how should we think about, I guess, the comp ratio in wealth management, all else equal, just given kind of the positive comp dynamics that creates?
WeÂre clearly trying to grow assets, both in the investment management and the wealth management business.
Institutional Securities revenues were $5 billion with solid performance across all divisions, despite a mixed trading backdrop and investment management, assets under management surpassed $0.5 trillion as strong performance continues to attract positive long-term net flows.
Further expansion of our services across the wealth spectrum from the highest end family offices to employees service through Morgan Stanley at Work provides us with the potential $4 trillion asset opportunity, also international opportunities, particularly Asia and continued growth of our loan portfolios are among the exciting opportunities that remain in this business.
Finally, our asset management business is well-positioned in the most attractive growth segments in the public and private markets with our leading active equity strategies and significant alternatives and solutions platforms.
One ongoing challenge of our continued pursuit of higher ROE performance has been the amount of equity weÂre required to hold, despite how weÂve repositioned the firm to benefit from the more stable revenue streams.
Despite a mixed market backdrop, revenues of $5 billion were the highest for a third quarter excluding DVA in 10 years.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.9 billion for the quarter, increasing 5% sequentially on higher volume-related costs driven by increased client activity.
In the context of fluid markets including trade and political uncertainty, economic growth concerns and central bank responses, we remain focused on serving our clients, while actively managing our risk.
Investment banking revenues were $1.5 billion, increasing 4% sequentially.
While equity underwriting saw a sequential decline, it was more than offset by the strength and share gains in our debt capital markets business.
Fixed income underwriting increased 39% sequentially to $584 million on the strength across both investment grade and leveraged loan issuance.
Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased 26% sequentially to $1.4 billion, driven by the strength in the credit complex.
Sequential results benefited from increased client activity, including structured transactions.
Commodities revenues improved quarter-over-quarter driven by North American Power and Gas. Investments declined $212 million sequentially.
Asset management revenues were $2.6 billion, up 4% quarter-over-quarter, benefiting from the improved asset levels we saw at prior quarterÂs end.
Seasonally slower client activity, a weaker equity calendar and negative movements in our deferred compensation plan investments impacted results.
The business saw a strong and broad-based positive net flows and assets under management surpassed $0.5 trillion.
Our equity strategies continue to deliver strong investment performance, driving net inflows.
Asset management fees of $664 million increased 8% sequentially.
Total spot assets rose to $903 billion, driven by increased client activity which also drove growth in RWAs. As a result, our common equity Tier 1 ratio declined to 16.2%.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.
You are certainly making progress over time with the ROTCE 13%, but youÂre doing that when you look at year-over-year where expenses grew faster than revenues.
Do you think that might impact a little bit of the potential returns on that investment or was this part of the scenario planning that you guys undertook when you made the acquisition that eventually commissions would head in this direction and competitive pressure would take you there?
And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
I think, fee-based asset flows of $16 billion were pretty strong relative to what we saw at one of your competitors.
And our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research.
We donÂt really look at it that way, because obviously, Christian, as you know very different types of businesses within it, whether itÂs for a $300 million family office, somebody liquidating a large concentrated position or the average investor selling a $1 million of stock or $100,000 of stock or whatever.

morganstanley,q4,2019,"The goal continues to be to shift our business further, emphasizing more durable sources of revenue within institutional securities and from wealth and investment management.
Over the last five years, we have increased the profitability of our wealth management business while still making investments in the U.S. banks and our modern wealth platform.
With combined revenues of approximately $21 billion our wealth and investment management businesses are among the largest platforms in the world and now we have an untapped opportunity to further scale our wealth management channel through our workplace offering.
The significant investments we make in the digital space, the acquisition of Solium position us to efficiently service the mass [indiscernible] population and capture new clients and assets through the workplace.
To-date nearly 40% of those plans on the legacy Morgan Stanley system have been transitioned to Shareworks and the remainder will be accomplished by year end 2020 and by the end of Â21 individual employees of our corporate clients will gain access to financial coaching, exclusive educational content and our self-directed brokerage offering providing them with an introduction to our wealth management services.
Over the next five to seven years we expect to convert over 1 million employee participants to either wealth management digital or advisory channels adding to the more than 3 million client relationships we have today.
The asset management sector is both very large and extremely fragmented lending itself to opportunities for growth in areas where we believe we can deliver differentiated value to our clients and to me one of the most exciting things we've done to capture this opportunity is product innovation illustrated by the number of new products we've developed.
We look forward to the transition to the new capital regime and expect Morgan Stanley will be able to return excess capital to shareholders while continuing to invest for future growth.
On wealth management we're making numerous investments across all of our platforms to enhance the digitalization of our firm and overall technological capabilities given our scale and other efficiencies.
Our institutional securities business reported revenues of $5.1 billion marking the best fourth quarter in over 10 years.
We reported fourth quarter revenues of $4.6 billion and pre-tax profit of $1.2 billion resulting in a PBT margin for the quarter of 25.4% Strong revenues were offset by higher seasonal expenses as well as a $37 million severance charge which had an 80 basis point impact on the margin.
We run the business based upon a myriad of things that we see from global economic growth to market share we have in each of our businesses to the capital we're using to prosecute our earnings in those businesses, our ability to drive efficiencies across the group, net of investments that we're making and we're currently running an ROTCE around 13% and so the two-year objectives feel like there's no compelling reason why we'd go below that.
In any individual quarter of course these things bounce around as you've seen in numbers over many, many years but over that time period we think the 13 to 15 is a very reasonable expectation and assuming normal market condition we would deliver on that.
For the longer-term aspirations really speaking the way we see embedded scale we have in our various businesses what the longer-term growth projections looks like our ability to manage our expenses you will see non-comp year-over-year are essentially flat this year which [immensely] itÂs pretty impressive given that we are investing in lot of parts of the business.
Many many years ago when our wealth management margins were around 10% or 11%, we set a target of 15% and I said publicly, I thought I could get 20% and obviously we exceeded that and the whole transformation business helped on that.
Many years ago we set our ROE target of 10% when I think our ROE was around 2% or 4% and we were constantly asked on this call when are you going to get there like, the kids in the back seat in the car saying when are we going to get there, when are we going to get there and we kind of got there and our feeling now is there's no compelling reason with normal economic growth and good discipline around expense management and the embedded scale in their businesses and the strength of the culture why these return shouldn't be achievable over a longer term period.
Could you talk a little about the market and revenue assumptions embedded within that target and at this point you guys seemed to have implied generally, especially with your comments just a minute ago James that about non-comp, flattening out here in 2019, we should be expecting self-funding of an investment and a more stability in the non-comp as opposed to the growth of prior years.
I can't guarantee where the first quarter is going to be, the second quarter, third quarter but over a full year where [27.2] with normal economic growth what we've done with the business I think that 28% I've been disappointed if we know that that I just put that out there.
So just I appreciate the comment and we continue to give further thought to that but we do give a reasonable amount of disclosure in the [indiscernible] around that we try to highlight it to you when it's a meaningful contributor based on meaningful swings in the marketplace across all the businesses as I said before the PBT impact is not material generally speaking a dollar revenue versus a dollar of comp expense.
Obviously, the potential for the different dynamics around the size of that client i.e. was whether it's mass affluent versus ultra high-net-worth or high net-worth will have an impact, the asset levels and cash levels and net new assets but again incrementally if we think we can bring on another million customers in five to seven years on top of our current existing base, it's why we're so excited about the opportunity.
Slide 7 through 11 highlight what you expect institutional security, the five-year share gain should continue, wealth management increase clients share by one-third, of the over longer time frame and that's management have new products you have digital initiatives non-comps flat.
I think I'm not sure we've ever had a call when you haven't asked for higher targets and it had to feel defensive when we're talking about wealth management margins above 28% efficiencies at 70% plus and ROTCE at 13% to 15%.
That's sort of it's fun and it's interesting and it's sort of saying what could we deliver aspirationally and that's probably where your head is in the longer term part of that chart the right hand side but in terms of running the business and in terms of thinking to our capital deployment and dividend strategy, compensation all of our investments that we're making we really focus frankly on the two-year objectives and what I've always tried to do with these target is set a range where the bottom of the range is what we should be able to deliver in all normal circumstances.
I get the share gained from the European banks but your expectation for that to continue and then on the wealth management side going to the mass affluent, you're going down market to the teeth of the Schwab's zero commission for wealth and after a number of years of kind of moving back from the lower end clients.
Normal market environment growth that obviously translates into higher revenues and we think there's some upside on share.
On the going down market I think about differently and for sure commission pricing has been going to zero in small trades for a long time and there have been examples of that in the digital space for years.
I realize you don't want to give all the details on the expense of adjustments related the deferred comp but I guess I'm trying to get a sense of the kind of full-year efficiency ratio of 73 as I think about kind of getting the 70-72.
The last time we publicly set a comp ratio goal for ISG I think was in 2015 which was 37% and we've managed in the last three or four years to be under that, sometimes 34%.
We grew revenues by 20% while we managed the expenses tightly, doubled net income and materially increased capital return.
This more fulsome suite of products allows us to deliver services to an even larger base of employees and this will help ensure that our touch points are not limited to stock plan participants.
We've already seen significant contribution from these products generating $19 billion of incremental assets under management and almost $500 million of incremental revenue in 2019 versus 2016.
These strategies continued new product launches and investments in our client franchise more broadly will be a very important component of future growth.
In addition to new private alternative product launches noted on the prior page we're seeing strong organic growth in our existing high-performing private funds.
For example, our infrastructure number 3 fund which closed in the fourth quarter is over 50% larger than infrastructure 2 raising $5.5 billion of institutional capital versus $3.6 billion respectively.
Our alpha products across both private and public markets as well as our world-class global solutions capabilities will be critical contributors to investment management's revenue growth.
Our public active equity strategies has strong performance and global client footprint has driven robust net flows.
In the fourth quarter severance expenses of $172 million related to a December employee action and intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $158 million largely offset each other.
Non-compensation expenses were essentially flat to 2018 at $11.3 billion demonstrating our ability to self fund incremental costs related to absorbing and integrating Solium and increased technology investments through continued discipline over our more controllable expenses particularly marketing and business development and professional services.
Prime brokerage performed well as client activity rose during the quarter with equity markets trending higher and derivative revenues declined sequentially as lower volatility weighed on results.
We continue to invest in our secured lending businesses which perform well and witnessed increased client interest from commercial real estate products.
Macro results declined versus the third quarter due to lower client activity.
Asset management revenues were essentially flat versus the prior quarter.
On a full year basis asset management revenues were also flat as a large market decline in Q4 2018 impacted first quarter results.
Total clients assets of $2.7 trillion increased 5% sequentially and 17% versus the prior year reflective of broader market movements.
Performance fees for the quarter were driven by strong results in our core real estate strategy and management fees increased on higher average AUM.
This line is primarily driven by carried interest which is earned from clients who are invested in private funds.
We entered 2020 with asset levels at new highs, healthy pipelines, constructive markets, engaged clients and a right sized expense base.

Our business mix and strategy, which emphasizes more durable sources of revenues, supported our results during the recent market disruption.
During this period, the firm extended credit and intermediated trading, responding to client needs and supporting open and functioning markets.

Given the S&P index declined 20% in the first quarter, the negative revenue impact was elevated.
Higher asset levels at the beginning of the first two months of the quarter helped insulate these revenues from the subsequent market decline in March.
Our smallest portfolio, the $14 billion tailor book is also performing well with just a handful of special mentioned loans.
The benefits of higher lending and the $31 billion increase in BDP balances were more than offset by lower interest rates and the resulting higher projected moorage prepayments.
Investment Management reported revenues of $692 million in the first quarter.
We had extensive engagement with our global clients throughout the quarter and the business continues to see strong net flows, despite the challenging environment.
The second half of the year remains uncertain and the path of the economy will be driven by the time it takes to resolve the health crisis and the impact of the unprecedented fiscal and monetary response.
And you're going to take them whether it's in the margin book, whether it's in the asset management portfolios, whether it's in the trading businesses and how did all of that look.
And for this fund, weÂve come through that and generated $9.5 billion of revenue, and that's net of the deferred compensation plans, which actually puts us a bit over of $10 billion in revenue, effectively flat to a year ago.
I know, coming into the second quarter, weÂll have less market volume, we have lower interest rates, we have lower asset prices at the moment.
I think, our BDP, which is our cheapest source of deposits, which currently have a cost of 1 basis point is now about 65% of the portfolio.
And I think, our deposit costs at the end of the quarter were about 56 or 57 basis points, and those should come down a little bit as we've just repriced our savings product down in light of the rate environment.
We increased for the quarter to bring our reserve level on funded loans up to 1.7 there.
I really appreciate that, Jon. So, another question and my follow-up, you committed, James, that there is not going to be any risk this year, which you can appreciate the idea that this would reassure your employees in extremely challenging time.
I think, our non-comps will be lower through the year and get back to sort of reasonable levels.
So, I wanted to start the question on the loan loss provision.
When we got to the end of the quarter, in light of what was -- what we were seeing in the rapidly changing sort of economic outlook, which at this point I would say, and James has mentioned it a couple of times.
And we looked at the downgrades, we looked at what loans we thought would be downgraded, the stress draw scenarios, we did some loss given default sensitivities, we looked at criticized asset trends, and we factored all of that into our analysis that ultimately led to the $350 million reserve build on the entire portfolio or a 74% increase from our day one CECL.
Our retail and wealth business had very little reserve build, given the performance in that portfolio in the Company.
You spoke of some of the risks to the target that you laid out at the start of the year, certainly not surprising given the world, using some of your words, is anything but normal.
And I wouldn't describe the -- some of the losses that we took in the derivatives -- trading businesses related to the degrossing that we saw going on.
As you obviously saw during the quarter, there were significant volatility in certain indices and indexes, there were historical relationships that totally broke down, and went in different directions.
As James said, you're going to take and businesses where you trade and put with your clients the potential to take losses.
It's not really a linear relationship, but I would say, we have -- our equity clients and many of the hedge funds and quants actually performed reasonably well in this environment despite the volatility, we have seen some of the gross balances rebound from the lows that we saw in the end of March.
And obviously the higher market levels helps to gross balances.
I know, we got to deal with lower rates and lower asset levels going down.
Guys, we're going to take just one more question I think, because we're running -- we've run over time and we've given you long answers.
Jon, can you share with us, I think, you've mentioned that coming out at the end of the quarter in Wealth Management, 23% of your customers assets were in cash.
That's a great question in terms of how our retail clients are going to reengage with the market.
Over 90% of our employees are currently working from home as we continue to serve our clients globally.
The quarter was divided in two distinct periods: January and February were characterized by buoyant risk assets, rising markets, and engaged clients; March proved to be unprecedented.
With market function and liquidity essentially restored, clients are weighing the major factors at play, including significant unemployment and economic disruption versus monetary and fiscal actions larger than any others in history.
We tightly managed professional services spend and saw declines in marketing business development, given the global shutdown.
Robust results in sales and trading were offset by markdowns on held for sale loans increased loan loss provision, and lower levels of investment banking activity.
Non-compensation expenses increased 14%, driven by higher BC&E and transaction taxes on elevated sales and trading volumes and an ACL on unfunded commitments of $115 million.
This was partially offset by an increase in accelerated primary offerings and secondary activity as we held clients across the global monetize equity stakes.
Equity sales and trading is number one globally and revenues increased 26% sequentially to $2.4 billion with strong performance across all business lines and particular strength in Asia.
Cash results were robust, reflecting the nearly 50% increase in global market volumes compared to the prior year.
Derivative revenues increased sequentially as we facilitated client needs during periods of severe market dislocation.
In late March, we reached a recent low in balances as market levels declined and we saw clients significantly degross.
Strong commodity results were supported by increased client activity, driven by meaningful swings in energy and metal prices.
Looking across other sales and trading and other revenues, three main factors drove approximately $1.1 billion of losses embedded in these two lines.
While changes in compensation expense related to these investments will generally be offset by changes in revenue, there can be some timing differences due to vesting schedules in a given period.
Client activity was extremely strong, reflecting high levels of engagement throughout the quarter as clients repositioned portfolios and moved into cash and other short-term securities.
Asset management revenues increased slightly from the prior quarter.
Total client assets of $2.4 trillion declined 11% sequentially, largely on market depreciation.
We had fee-based flows of $18 billion and generated strong net new assets at a pace above our historical run rate, highlighting the stability and health of this business.
Total net flows of $57 billion benefitted from a significant new long-term client partnership and our liquidity business.
Total spot assets rose to $948 billion as we deployed our balance sheet to support clients during this challenging period and retail clients saw safety, increasing our deposits by $45 billion.
The increase in RWAs was driven primarily by increased client trading activity and market volatility as well as lending.
Our client-driven model combined with strong capital and liquidity will help deliver relative earnings strength in this uncertain environment.
But, there are several factors that will impact our earnings power in the near term, including lower asset values and balances, interest rates near zero as well as volatility and economic uncertainty impacting capital markets and M&A volumes.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous.
I mean, if you'd said three months ago that 90% of our employees will be working from home and the firm would be functioning fine, I'd say that is a test I'm not prepared to take because the downside of being wrong on that is massive.
Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
We saw a lot of incremental net new assets into the Firm, periods of volatility like this generally we see in our client base look for professional advice.
Yes. Because it's a conservative business to people who are clients of ours who we know what their asset and liquidity picture is.
Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
At Morgan Stanley, my hope is we'd be able to test people to make sure that they're healthy and clean and we bring people back in the staggered way as soon as the government lets us do that.

wellsfargo,q2,2015,"Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss second quarter result and answer your questions.
We earned $5.7 billion in the second quarter, as our diversified business model continued to generate strong loan and deposit growth.
Our growth benefited from the $11.5 billion GE Capital loan purchasing and financing transaction in the second quarter.
Our credit performance continued to improve and our net charge-off rate declined to 30 basis points of average loans, the lowest level in 20 years.
On Page 3, we highlight the year-over-year growth John emphasized in his remarks including revenue, loans, deposits and EPS as well as improving credit.
Revenue increased $40 million from first quarter with strong growth in net interest income, up $284 million reflecting growth in earning assets.
We had linked quarter growth and fee income in most of our customer-facing businesses including deposit service charges, trust and investment fees, card fees, merchant processing, commercial real estate brokerage, mortgage and insurance.
However, non-interest income declined $244 million from first quarter due to lower market-sensitive revenue and lower other income driven by the accounting impact related to our debt hedges.
ItÂs also important to note that we didnÂt acquire these loans until late in the quarter, so while it increased ending loan balances, most of the benefit to average loans and to net interest income will be reflected in the third quarter.
Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $15 billion or 7% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high-quality non-conforming mortgages.
Credit card balances were up $3.9 billion or 14% from a year ago, benefiting from strong new account growth and the DillardÂs portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year.
New originations reflected the strong auto market and were up 5% from a year ago and up 15% from first quarter benefiting from seasonality.
Our earning asset mix results and diversified Â results and diversified sources of interest income, the drivers of our fee generation are also diverse and vary based on interest rate and economic conditions, for example, market-sensitive revenue which includes trading gains from our Â trading and gains from our debt and equity investments declined 21% from first quarter, market-sensitive revenue was 8% of our fee income in the second quarter, down from 11% in the first quarter, however, many of our other customer-facing businesses generated higher fee income.
We grew net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by %524 million or 5% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in average earning assets, up 11% from a year ago.
The $312 million increase in net interest income from first quarter reflected growth in earning assets and one extra day in the quarter.
Net interest income also benefited from increased income from variable sources, lower deposit cost and higher income from interest rate swaps used to convert a portion of our floating rate commercial loans to fixed rate as we continue to add duration to our balance sheet.
The increase this quarter was driven by balance sheet repricing and growth including growth in investments and loans and lower deposit cost which benefited the margin by 4 basis points.
The other non-interest income category was down $426 million in the second quarter driven by the accounting impact of interest rate and currency hedges associated with our long-term debt.
ItÂs important to note that while total non-interest income declined, if you exclude market-sensitive revenue and other income, we had strong diversified fee growth across our other fee categories demonstrating growth from doing more business with our customers.
Based on the current rate environment, the level of our pipeline and the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, we currently expect originations in the third quarter to be lower than the second quarter.
While we continue to invest in our businesses reflected in higher professional services and advertising expenses in the second quarter, we remained focused on operating efficiently as indicated by our efficiency ratio improving to 58.5%.
Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.4 billion in the second quarter, down 8% from first quarter which included the discrete tax benefit.
This strong growth reflects our success in attracting new customers to Wells Fargo as well as the benefit of better retention of our existing households as we remain focused on meeting their financial needs.
For example, weÂve been successfully growing the penetration rate of credit cards to our retail bank households which has grown to 42.6% in the second quarter, up from 39% a year ago and 34.9% two years ago.
This growth in average loans did not fully reflect the benefit of the GE Capital transaction reported late in the quarter.
The strong loan and deposit growth helps grow revenue by 2% from a year ago.
Our credit losses in our residential real estate portfolios declined 22% and non-accrual loans declined $388 million or 4% from first quarter.
Our energy team completed their spring re-determination process during the second quarter and as expected, the drop in energy prices did impact the cash flow and collateral values of a number of our borrowers leading to downward portfolio migration.
The decline in our net payout ratio reflected our strong asset and RWA growth as our first call for capital is for providing credit to our customers.
In summary, our second quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong loan and deposit growth and momentum in non-interest income across many of our customer-facing businesses.
So, there are variety of loan categories that deserves to be mentioned individually, but you know we are aggressively growing the card business with our existing deposit customers and percentage gains there will probably continue to be very strong.
Still a lot going on in commercial real estate and as you mentioned the GE Capital loans helped us late in the third quarter there.
Jumbo loans on the residential side have been growing on the balance sheet at the same strong pace for a long time and we continue to Â we expect to see that there.
I mean, the outcome is what it is and if we had about a $400 million increase to non-performing assets in energy for the quarter, which feels like it makes sense.
So, we are bumping along here at 30 basis points of annualized net losses on the total loan portfolio and as we called out in the past, we shouldnÂt expect releases in any given quarter because itÂs going to Â the calculation heats quarter of the allowance is going to include the observed portfolio of the portfolio is going to include general economic conditions is going to include where the growth is coming from in the mix in the portfolio.
So, I would not model in release of this magnitude going forward and of course, as weÂve said, we keep building our loan portfolio, youÂd expect to see builds often Â things being equal.
And as I said, I would assume that the next couple of quarters how much better than the last quarter in terms of we are still resolving these issues, some of them are just coming to life for certain borrowers but itÂs a very contained portion of our loan portfolio and the aggregate impact should not be material for Wells Fargo.
Just wanted to take a step back, as we enter potentially a rising rate environment in the second half of the year fingers crossed, one of your peers they meant, mentioned, anticipating a significantly more competitive environment for retail deposits given the regulators have essentially said, there are good deposits and bad deposits this time around.
And to the point of entering new markets, well, we adjust our store footprint meaningfully every year by opening and closing stores where we see fit, I think as Carrie Tolstedt has described in our last Investor Day, we believe that we need a certain amount of scale in any urban market before we can really make a difference and we are in most of the markets that we like to be in, and of course we are not going to get there through acquisitions.
So if there were a bigger RWA opportunity, we would measure where we were starting from, we would understand what sort of capital generation was going on at that time and itÂs possible, we would end up retaining a little bit more in order to maintain satisfactory levels while growing assets.
So, I guess the question is, do you think we're at an inflection point where we'll no longer see deposit growth continue to exceed loan growth and if so, does that suggest that that we should begin to see some continued improvement in NIMs going forward?
So, whether we can outgrow or not outgrow, we sure like our opportunities continuing on the deposit side, because after all we are growing net new consumer checking accounts primary by 5.6% and on small business we are growing by 5.3% or 4%.
Talking a bit about the mortgage side, when we saw rates go up, but I think a lot of Â when the volumes have held in very strong, some of that I think is the Â as the refi pipeline coming out of first quarter, but - can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the purchase market world?
I think it's going to stay in the upper part of the range until revenue moves higher, which will probably happen as a result of - or at least most meaningfully over a short period of time because of rates moving higher.
We are spending the money that we think we need to spend to run a great business today and manage risk, as well as invest in the future around things that customers want, things that we need to be a well run, resilient, compliant, risk managed, technologically savvy firm, and that gets us to 58 plus or minus percent, which I would remind you is a very good number for a bank of our size.
We've had a benefit in the past and this time we had a negative and it was driven by a few things, but mostly by the major movements in longer-term swap rates in dollar, Sterling and LIBOR during the quarter.
All of those things are opportunities for us to make the business even stronger and more relevant going forward on top of what we feel is very good performance over the last few years.
And as you know, in our trading business, we have what you are thinking of which is market-making and customer accommodation activity but we also have the impact of our own deferred comp program, et cetera, which makes that line a little bit noisy.
Well, it's going to depend on what happens with deposits versus loan and other earning asset growth primarily.
So, when we use the term duration, we are using it in that context, but not to define a duration of the balance sheet, but really to think about using those tools, the investment portfolio and loan portfolios to impact our overall asset or liability sensitivity.
But as you suggest, itÂs regardless of what's happening with short-term rates and over what period of time that normalization of policy occurs, it's our expectation that the longer-end of the curve, that we are going to be lower for longer than we would have thought six months ago, a year ago, or a couple of years ago and how we are managing the balance sheet is a reflection of that.
Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings; including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.
Let me highlight our growth this quarter compared with one year ago.
Our deposit franchise continue to generate strong customer and balance growth with average deposits up $83.8 billion or 8% while we reduced deposit costs.
WeÂve reduced our common shares outstanding for five consecutive quarters with shares down 105 million from one year ago.
The labor market continued to recover with a record 57 consecutive months of payroll gains and housing activity has been especially encouraging with second quarter position to be the best quarter performance sales since 2007.
John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer will now provide more details on our second quarter results.
Short-term investments and FED funds sold were down $59.1 billion from the first quarter reflecting loan growth, security purchases and lower deposit balances driven by seasonality in our consumer businesses and repricing in certain wholesale businesses.
The decline in ending balances reflected the seasonal impact to consumer balances due to income tax payments and repricing in certain wholesale businesses primarily global financial institutions.
Page 9 highlights our revenue diversification in the balance between spread and fee income which has shifted slightly to more net-interest income as we benefited from strong earning asset growth.
Higher variable income from increased loan fees, semi-annual preferred dividends and PCR recoveries contributed 1 basis point to the margin, customer-driven deposit growth reduced the margin by 3 basis points but had minimal impact to net interest income.
Average loans grew 12% from a year ago with broad based growth across most wholesale businesses.
Average core deposits grew 14% from a year ago and flat linked quarter reflecting pricing actions we took in the second quarter to reduce deposit costs.
Turning to Page 17, our capital levels remains strong with our estimated common equity tier-1 ratio under Basel-3 fully phased in at 10.5% in the second quarter.
Our common shares outstanding declined by 17.7 million shares in the second quarter reflecting 36.3 million shares repurchased and 18.6 million shares issued.
While the current interest rate environment remains uncertain, we are actively managing our expenses while focusing on meeting our customersÂ financial needs to generate growth.

wellsfargo,q3,2015,"Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions.
We earned $5.8 billion in the third quarter, as our diversified business model generated growth in revenue, loans, deposits and net income compared with a year ago.
Our core loan portfolio increased by $73.4 billion, or 9% from a year ago reflecting both strong organic growth and the benefit of the acquisitions we have completed over the past year.
Increasing the number of household reserve, adding commercial relationships, deepening consumer and commercial relationships and growing loans and deposits, this focus will benefit our long term growth while we continue to meet our customers financial needs and navigate the challenges of todayÂs economy.
On page three, we showed the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted including revenue, pre-tax, pre provision profit, loans, deposits, net income and EPS and we reduced our common shares outstanding by 106.5 million shares over the past year.
We grew total assets by 7% from a year ago and 2% from second quarter with growth in loans, short term investments and investment securities.
Turning to the income statement overview on page five, revenue increased $557 million from the second quarter with growth in net interest and non-interest income and we generated positive operating leverage as expenses declined.
Our core loan portfolio grew by $73.4 billion or 9% from a year ago and was up $17.1 billion from the second quarter.
C&I loans were up $38 billion or 15% from a year ago, the growth was diversified across our wholesale businesses with double digit year-over-year growth and asset backed finance, corporate banking, commercial real estate, structured real estate and government and institutional banking.
Commercial real estate loans grew $12.8 billion or 10% from a year ago and included the second quarter of GE Capital transaction and organic growth.
Credit card balances were up $4 billion or 14% from a year ago benefitting from strong new account growth, more active accounts and the DillardÂs portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2014.
We had record new originations in the third quarter up 10% from a year ago reflecting the strong auto market while we have remained disciplined in our approach.
We grew net interest income $516 million or 5% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in loans and securities and by adding duration to the balance sheet.
The $187 million increase in net interest income from the second quarter reflected growth in investments and loans including the benefit from the GE Capital loan purchase and financing transaction related to commercial real estate assets that settled late in the second quarter.
As a result, weÂve been adding duration to our balance sheet, however our balance sheet remains asset sensitive and we are positioned to benefit from higher rates and we expect to be able to grow net interest income over the long term even if the rate environment continues to be challenging.
Total non-interest income increased $370 million from second quarter, driven by higher equity gains, other income, deposit service charges and card fees.
Non-controlling interest reduced the impact of the equity gains through our net income and increased $120 million from the second quarter.
Origination volume of $55 billion was down 11% from the second quarter reflecting the expected seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, but was up 15% from a year ago benefitting from a stronger housing market.
We are focussed on managing expenses, partially reflected in the 27% reduction in travel and entertainment expense from a year ago as we reduced non-customer facing travel, however we expect to operate at the higher end of our target efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2015 and until our revenue benefits from higher rates we expect to remain at the upper end of that range.
Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.7 billion in the third quarter, up 7% from a year ago and up 10% from second quarter.
Despite a challenging equity market environment, wealth and investment management earned $606 million in the third quarter up 10% from a year ago and up 3% from the second quarter.
These results reflect a strong balance sheet growth and net interest income growing 18% from a year ago.
Retail brokerage and managed account assets were flat from a year ago and down 6% from second quarter, the length quarter declined reflected the weak equity markets.
In summary, our third quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong growth in loans and deposits and revenue growth reflecting higher net interest and higher non-interest income.
This agreement provides us with a unique opportunity to add relationships and earning assets in businesses where GE Capital was an unequivocal market leader and where we either have meaningful experience or in the case of commercial distribution finance is a strong compliment to our existing capabilities.
Similar to the GE Capital transaction related to commercial real estate assets that closed in the second quarter, the loans releases roughly 90% based in U.S. and Canada will be recorded a fair value inclusive of a life time credit loss at close, including transition cost related to integrating these businesses we expect this acquisition to be neutral to modestly accretive to our 2016 results.
Just to summarize the timing related to our GE transactions, our results this quarter include the impact from the GE Capital transaction related to commercial real estate assets that closed in the second quarter and we expect to close in the first quarter of 2016 the GE railcar transaction and the GE Capital transactions we announced yesterday.
So with respect to the first part of your question, Joe the businesses line up well as we said the commercial distribution finance business is an asset based lending business that operates between OEMs on the one hand and the distributors on the other.
We're going to be adding these incremental assets that we talked about in connection with the GE portfolio, some of which are leases, so you think of them as a little bit longer term and fixed rate which will have the same impact as adding securities.
Just to put an emphasizes on that Mike, expenses get a lot of discussion around here and we are keenly focus on them, because as John mentioned he saved Â and we think of it in ways of what will the customer pay for and what makes us a stronger long term provider of services to our customers and to be a more relevant company to all our constituents.
And as John mentioned depending on the macro environment not all that shows up in that value creation the next quarter, but over the long period or even the interim period that is Â the best way we think to successfully grow and add to the things that are customers and our shareholders value.
We've been saying for a few quarters that what's going to happened, subsequently it's going to reflect loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic outcomes.
But it should, if we grow our portfolio and the new assets look like the assets that we already have that we'll begin providing for those which could become more of net outcome as we're already had a generational low in terms of charge-offs which means that credit performance can't really improve meaningful from where we are today.
I don't think if it is a reversal, but every quarter our employee benefit expense on the one hand and our trading results on the other hand reflect the outcomes from our deferred comp approach.
John, when you did the initial GE portfolio acquisition I guess that was couple of quarters ago, you said that you were going to continue to look at assets at GE and obviously you did.
Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth with total deposits reaching a record $1.2 trillion up $71.6 billion or 6% from a year ago and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.8%.
Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs of only 31 basis points of average loans and we operated within our targeted ranges for ROA, ROE, efficiency and net payout ratio.
Core 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $15.3 billion or 7% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality non-conforming mortgages.
We continued to successfully grow our primary consumer checking customers which were up 5.8% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers increased 5%.
Our total market sensitive revenue which includes trading and gains from debt and equity investments increased $210 million from second quarter but was down slightly from a year ago.
Lower income from variable sources also reduced the margin by 3 basis points, these decreases were partially offset by balance sheet growth and repricing driven by security purchases and higher loan balances which benefited the margin by 5 basis points.
Operating losses were stable from the second quarter but they remained higher than the five quarter average as we continued to have elevated litigation accruals for various legal matters.
We are growing our credit and debit card businesses through new customer growth and increased usage among existing customers.
Loan growth was driven by an increase in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans and security based lending.
The length quarter decline was driven by lower non-interest income primarily as a result of lower equity investment gains and reduced sales in trading and investment banking activity reflecting market volatility.
This growth benefited from the GE Capital loan purchase related to commercial real estate assets that closed last quarter and also reflected broad based growth across most wholesale businesses.
Treasury management revenue continued to grow up 9% from a year ago driven by new sales of treasury management solutions.
Our net charge-off rate was 31 basis points of average loans, up slightly from second quarter primarily from seasonally higher auto losses.
Future allowance levels whether they are higher or lower will be driven by a variety of factors including loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions.
As John mentioned earlier, operating from a position of strength allows us to make quality acquisitions that help us serve more markets and meet more of our customerÂs financial needs.
This transaction involves 77,000 railcars and just over 1000 locomotives as well as associated operating at long term leases that will be added to our existing First Union Rail business, making us the second largest railcar and locomotive leasing company in North America.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.
But any color on maybe what's a good run rate there or just maybe market sensitive revenues overall, recognizing they were down a couple hundred million this quarter?
Yes. We've talked about our real estate strategy we where shrunk by 20 million square feet over the last few years and still have more to go.
Hi. Obviously it seems like the biggest contributor as a revenue driver is asset growth stemming in part from these acquisitions, but given sort of NIM commentary and the efficiency ratio commentary, should we expect positive operating leverage into next year or more basically zero?
So it sounds like than its basically top line led operating leverage stemming in part from continued shift in mix of revenue sources, is that fair?
My second question would be whether the integration of this latest large business from GE is basically going to preclude you from looking at other possible asset portfolios et cetera at other companies due to the funding issues?

wellsfargo,q4,2015,"Our contribution to the real economy in 2015 was broad-based and included originating $213 billion in residential mortgage loans, $31 billion of auto loans, almost in $19 billion in new loan commitments to our small business customers who primarily have less than $20 million in annual revenue, $34 billion of middle market loans and $29 billion of commercial real estate loans.
Our financial strength and competitive position have enabled us to capture opportunities for loan growth organically and through acquisitions, with average loans up $51 billion from a year ago, a 6% increase.
Our deposit franchise once again, generated strong customer and balance growth with average deposits up $80 billion or 7% from a year ago and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.6%.
Our credit results continued to be very strong, with our net charge-off rate declining to 33 basis points for the year.
Finally, the building blocks of our long term growth, increasing our customer base, deepening relationships and growing loans and deposits continue to be the foundation of our success.
While our fourth quarter earnings were the same as a year ago, the fourth quarter of 2014 had the benefit of a credit reserve release and the gain from the sale of our government guaranteed student loan portfolio, our results this quarter demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business drivers.
Compared with a year ago, we continued to have strong loan and deposit growth throughout our diversified commercial and consumer businesses.
Credit quality remained strong, with net charge-offs of 36 basis points of average loans and we continued to have strong liquidity and capital levels.
On page 3, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including growing revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans, deposits and earnings per share.
Turning to the income statement overview on page 5, revenue declined $289 million from third quarter, as growth in net interest income was offset by lower non-interest income primarily due to the higher level of equity investment gains in the third quarter.
As shown on page 6, we had continued strong broad-based loan growth in the fourth quarter.
Our core loan portfolio grew by $62.8 billion or 8% from a year ago and was up $15.4 billion from the third quarter.
As highlighted on page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $67 billion or 6% from a year ago.
We demonstrated our ability to grow net interest income which was up 4% from a year ago through balance sheet growth, even in the challenging rate environment during 2015.
On a full-year basis, we believe we can increase net interest income in 2016 compared with 2015, in part due to the December rate increase and also from anticipated balance sheet growth.
We had linked quarter growth in a number of our businesses including investment banking, card fees, commercial real estate brokerage and mortgage banking.
Origination volume of $47 billion was down 15% from third quarter, reflecting the expected seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, but was up 7% from a year ago benefiting from a stronger housing market.
Turning to our business segments, starting on page 13, community banking earned $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 1% from a year ago and down 7% from third quarter.
Wholesale banking earned $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, stable from a year ago and up 9% from third quarter.
Revenue also benefited from continued balance sheet growth, with average loans up 13% from a year ago, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth.
Revenue reflected strong balance sheet growth, with net interest income up 15% from a year ago.
Net charge-offs increased $128 million from third quarter, reflecting $90 million of higher losses in our oil and gas portfolio which totaled $118 million in the fourth quarter and seasonally higher consumer losses.
The performance of our consumer real estate portfolios which are 36% of our loans outstanding continue to benefit from the improving housing market.
We didn't have a reserve release or build in the fourth quarter, as the improvement in our residential real estate portfolios was offset by higher commercial reserves, reflecting the impact from our oil and gas portfolio.
However, as we've mentioned in the past, it takes time for losses to emerge and at current price levels, we would expect to have a higher oil and gas losses in 2016.
In summary, our fourth quarter and full-year results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model, with strong growth in loans and deposits and consistent earnings.
So if that continues to be true, that's probably a continued tailwind, in terms of some of the drivers of the estimation of embedded loss on the consumer real estate side of the loan portfolio.
And so, the rate of change of how loans actually move to loss, reflects a lot of things and it's not just price.
But it's going to be a function of organic loan growth, closing on our GE portfolios that we've been talking about and then the number of hikes that come and when they come.
And having said all that, what we're really focused on is growing dollars of net interest income and the balance sheet structural issues, as we have rapid deposit growth or funding activity, etcetera, have an impact on the margin, but it's about dollars for us.
We'll probably focus more on that and the other targets that we give you in our May Investor Day. There's a little bit of time between now and then to really set the course for the next couple of years, that reflect the environment, that reflect the balance sheet structure that we have, that reflect our expense profile.
But I still feel like it's appropriate to think about the higher end of the range, so the 57% to 59% for this year, unless it rates really, really begin to move which seems hard to imagine sitting here at this moment.
I'm wondering, did you get enough color back from your regulators, in terms of how oil and gas losses were stressed in the 2015 CCAR and how that level is comparing to the base case right now that's embedded in your reserve?
I mean, it's made a little bit more complicated by what's going on -- in these couple of weeks, in terms of just with respect to the impact of asset-based fund or fee type arrangements.
I think it's David's expectation to continue to grow the business by adding new customers, to encourage customers to stay invested, if that's appropriate for where they are in their investing life cycle, to use these as entry points for people who have more money to put to work and longer term goals.
But I think what we're talking about in revenue terms, even with the type of pullback that we've had in the first quarter is call it, hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of net income sensitivity, if we weren't to recover from here and if we didn't have meaningful new customer -- new client growth over the course of the year, so.
And what's just your expectation, if it's different than just kind of the MBA, Fannie, Freddie for what you think the mortgage market does in the year ahead?
In terms of servicing retrenching, it's -- we'll get to a more normalized level of defaulted loan workout activity over the course of the next couple of years, as that -- the full crisis era inventory works it's way off.
We think of it more as more of a purchase market as we go forward, especially if rates increase, although they're going the other way right now.
So I wonder if you could comment, like when you just talk to that kind of industrial component of your customer base, who maybe is a more exposed to cutbacks by the energy industry and the strong dollar, do you think it's possible we actually are in an industrial recession right now?
But I think more broadly, at least as it reveals itself in our own customer activity, people who are more reliant on exports have been -- were hit early and hit hard by how strong the dollar has become over the course of the last couple of years.
But you've seen the growth in our commercial loan portfolios which reflects people doing business.
I think we've got 4 basis points of loss, something like that coming through that portfolio.
Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.
While falling energy prices have hurt certain sectors of the U.S. economy, most consumers and many businesses are benefiting from lower power costs which results in more discretionary cash that can be used for other purposes.
The housing market also continued its steady improvement, with price appreciation of 6% helping homeowners build equity and improving the credit quality of our consumer real estate portfolio where net charge-offs were down 44% from a year ago.
I am excited about opportunities to continue to build on these growth drivers in the year ahead, as our team members remain focused on satisfying all of our customer's financial needs.
Turning to page 4, we grew earning assets 3% from third quarter with loans, short term investments and investment securities all increasing.
The debt we issued during the quarter had a weighted average maturity of about eight years, at a cost of approximately three-month LIBOR plus 70 basis points.
Core 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $15.9 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality nonconforming mortgage loans.
Commercial real estate loans grew $13.6 billion or 10% from a year ago and included the second quarter GE Capital acquisition in organic growth.
Credit card balances were up $2.9 billion or 9% from a year ago, benefiting from new account growth and strong growth in active accounts as we experienced better activation rates on new accounts and more active users among our existing customers.
This relationship focus has resulted in strong primary customer growth, with the primary consumer checking customers up 5.6% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers up 4.8% Primary customers are over twice as profitable as non-primary customers.
Over the past year as we benefited from balance sheet growth, we've been able to grow net interest income by 4% while noninterest income has been relatively stable compared with a year ago.
The $131 million increase in net interest income from third quarter reflected growth in earning assets and higher income from variable sources including periodic dividends, loan recoveries and fees.
These benefits were partially offset by reduced income from seasonally lower balances of mortgages held-for-sale and increased interest expense from higher debt balances.
Income from variable sources improved the margin by 2 basis points, but was offset by customer-driven deposit growth which reduce the margin by 3 basis points, with a minimal impact on net interest income.
All other repricing growth and mix reduced the margin by another 3 basis points, driven largely by increased debt balances including the funding related to the GE Capital transactions that I mentioned earlier on the call.
The volatile markets we've had so far this year could also impact our results in capital markets related businesses, including investment banking and trading and may also affect the asset-based valuations and transaction volumes in our market-driven businesses including retail, brokerage, asset management and trust.
Other income declined $214 million from third quarter, driven by the impact of higher period end interest rates on our debt hedging results and the sale of Warranty Solutions last quarter which benefited third quarter income.
Operating losses were down $191 million from third quarter from lower litigation accruals, while foreclosed asset expense declined $89 million due to commercial real estate recoveries.
We continue to grow the number of retail bank households we serve and we're focused on building lifelong relationships with our customers by providing them with exceptional customer service.
The increase in fee income was driven by investment banking and gains from the sale of equity fund investments driven by Volker, as well as commercial real estate related businesses such as Eastdil Secured, our commercial real estate brokerage and advisory business, Multifamily Capital and structured real estate.
Retail brokerage managed account assets were up 3% from third quarter and down 1% from a year ago.
The decline from a year ago reflected lower market valuations which were partially offset by positive flows.
We continue to work closely with our customers and are monitoring market conditions and we have reset borrowing base determinations twice since energy prices started to decline in late 2014.

And while I'm sure it'll change a little bit over time, it's not going to behave like balance sheet first mortgage loans did pre-crisis, because there was just a different appetite for the types of loans that banks might hold.

wellsfargo,q1,2016,"Thank you, Jim. While the persistent low rate environment, market volatility and continued weakness in the oil and gas industry provided some near term headwinds, our long-term results continued to be driven by our focus on the real economy.
While deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove a $200 million reserve build, the rest of our loan portfolio continued to have strong credit results with our total net charge-off rate remaining near historical lows at 38 basis points annualized, reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio.
For example, while low energy prices have negatively impacted the oil and gas industry, the U.S. is still a net energy importer and the benefits of falling prices have outweighed the costs for consumers and most businesses.
So while the start of 2016 has shown that the economic recovery remains slow and uneven, we remain focused on the long term drivers of our success, namely: increasing customers, loans, deposits and building capital.
We have now generated quarterly earnings of more than $5 billion for 14 consecutive quarters, one of only two companies in the country to do so, demonstrating the strength of our diversified business model and our consistent risk discipline.
The deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove the $200 million credit reserve build in the quarter also.
On Page 4, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including increases in revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans and deposits.
Revenue increased $609 million from the fourth quarter with growth in both net interest and non-interest income.
As shown on Page 7, we had continued strong loan growth in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and 3% from the fourth quarter.
Commercial loans grew $31.6 billion from the fourth quarter, including $24.9 billion from the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth.
We grew net interest income $79 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in earning assets, including the partial quarter impact from the assets acquired from GE Capital, the benefit from higher short-term rates and disciplined deposit pricing.
We grew net interest income in the first quarter by 6% from a year ago and continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full-year basis in 2016 compared with 2015 even if there are no additional rate increases.
The non-interest income also benefited from the increase in lease income related to the GE Capital acquisitions we completed in the quarter, which also included related lease depreciation expense.
As I highlighted at the start of the call, the increase was primarily driven by $752 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter.
Net charge-offs increased $55 million from the fourth quarter, including an increase of $87 million from our oil and gas portfolio.
While our oil and gas portfolio remains under stress due to low prices and excess leverage in the industry, the rest of our loan portfolios have performed well.
Non-performing assets increased $706 million from the fourth quarter, we had $1.1 billion in higher oil and gas non-accruals and $343 million in nonaccrual loan from the GE Capital acquisitions which was within our acquisition underwriting assumptions.
Since first quarter 2015 we have released $1.8 billion of allowance that was allocated to our residential real estate portfolios while providing $1.4 billion of additional allowance allocated to our oil and gas portfolio, demonstrating the advantage of our diversified loan portfolio.
We had $17.8 billion of oil and gas loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, up $474 million from the fourth quarter, including $236 million in loans acquired from GE Capital.
Reflecting the downward credit migration, our allocated allowance for the oil and gas portfolio increased $504 million to $1.7 billion.
In summary, we are actively monitoring the impact from the disruption in the oil and gas industry in all areas of our business and we're working closely with all impacted customers.
While the level of losses we have in our oil and gas portfolio will continue to be impacted by the volatility and stress in the industry and it will take time to move through this part of the cycle, the experience of managing through many cycles will continue to be beneficial to our overall performance.
In summary, our first quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model as we continued to produce strong financial results in an environment that included some near-term headwinds.
Now weÂre analyzing the reserve every quarter and to the extent that there's continued improvement in consumer real estate in particular, itÂs certainly possible that that produces incremental benefit that absorbs some of what's happening on the oil and gas side, that's been true for a while and it may continue to be true for a while.
But I'd be hesitant to tell you that this was the big quarter, or this was the quarter, things will unfold as they're going to unfold depending on what happens with what prices, both spot and forward and the pace of restructurings of services and E&P companies.
A lot of clients, a lot of questions that I have been getting is that yeah, energy, a lot of people might be reserved good for energy, but the second or third derivative of energy was a lot of the growth of this economy over the last year or two, and since energy is starting to struggle, that the economy's got in a recession, I know you've heard of it.
There are obvious pockets of strength around the country but when you move out of oil and gas, we're in the same low growth, better consumer, strong employment environment that we've been operating in for a couple of years, not enough to make it feel like rates are going to move as a result of it but not enough to feel like we're stalling either.
We're going to have to put some of it to work, weÂre very cautious about what it means entering at these levels in terms of capital impact in the future, if a subsequent rate rise does occur that's obviously a big issue for us.
Well, weÂve Â I think we've been pretty public with the fact that we're going to hold our ground with respect to what we think our quality loan terms and borrower profile, and we've actually seen our share slip a little bit as the overall size of the auto finance market has kept pace with the sale of autos, new cars in particular that has been at a record level now for a few years.
Some of the things that feel a little bit different right now, I mean seasonally obviously we're in a better place in Q1 than Q4 just because those loans behave that way, collections and losses are lower in the first quarter than they are in the fourth quarter.
Where we've always had our eye on the elevated level of used car auction prices, the Manheim Index in particular is evidence that we point to get a sense for whether loss given default is going to be worse in the future than it is today or in the recent past and that index has been down I think 3% linked quarter, 2% year over year.
We've allowed our market leading position to slip a little bit, let other people buy the loans that don't make sense for us, itÂs still a great business for us and has been for a long time.
I guess the other question was just, wondering if you could talk a bit more about the Â how the GE Capital business integrations are going and how are you feeling currently about the potential for cross selling or revenue synergies.
So I think you mentioned 25% of your loans went through the redeterminations process in the quarter; is that right?
But it's the tradeoff between foregone earnings, capital sensitivity and a handful of other things that we're having to assess and we're doing it with our best estimate of where we think rates are going and what happens if they don't go there.
And so the long and the short of it is I don't think that we're going to continue to build cash balances like we did in the first quarter.
John, lastly trying to climb into your head a little bit, as you were looking at the first quarter and you had the gain from selling the crop insurance business and rates were going down and you had so much market disruption, were you kind of thinking, since I have this gain over here, I don't really feel comfortable putting my liquidity to work because of whatÂs going on in the market.
We continued to grow our customer base both organically and through acquisitions and February was the strongest month for retail bank household growth in five years.
Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth with average deposits up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5%.
This improvement has continued to benefit our consumer real estate portfolio where net charge-offs were down 41% from a year ago.
Commercial real estate also remained strong with vacancy rates low in apartment, industrial and retail sectors and our CRE portfolio continued to generate net recoveries.
While earnings declined from a year ago, our results in the first quarter last year included a discrete tax benefit of $359 million or $0.07 per share and a $100 million dollar reserve release.
Our revenue benefited from the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business resulting in a $381 million gain recorded in all other non-interest income.
All other income also included $379 million of hedge ineffectiveness primarily on our own long-term debt hedges reflecting the impact of lower rates and foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter.
Short-term investments and Fed funds sold increased $30.4 billion reflecting growth in deposits, long term debt and our disciplined approach in managing liquidity and investment securities during the quarter.
Consumer loans declined $923 million from the fourth quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto and securities-based lending and student lending was more than offset by reductions in junior lien mortgage and seasonal declines in credit card.
Our total average loan yield increased 8 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the GE Capital acquisitions as well as the benefit of floating rate loan repricing.
The benefit of our strong balance sheet and industry expertise enabled us to add these high quality businesses, including talented new team members and valuable customer relationships.
We completed the GE Railcar Services acquisition on January 1, which included $918 million of loans and interest earning leases and $3.2 billion of operating leases reported in other assets.
C&I loans were up $50.5 billion or 19% from a year ago driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth.
Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $17.3 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans.
Commercial real estate loans grew $15.8 billion or 12% from a year ago, benefiting from the second quarter GE Capital acquisition and organic growth.
Credit card balances were up $3.1 billion or 10% from a year ago, reflecting new accounts and increases in active accounts.
These increases were partially offset by reduced income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and loan fees and one less day in the quarter.
While linked-quarter trends in deposit service charges and card fees were negatively impacted by seasonality, both of these fees grew 8% from a year ago driven by account growth.
Origination volume was $44 billion, down 6% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality but purchase originations were up 13% from a year ago, reflecting a stronger housing market.
Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability declined $107 million from fourth quarter, which also contributed to lower production revenue.
Servicing income increased $120 million from fourth quarter, from higher net MSR servicing hedge results and lower unreimbursed servicing costs.
We continued to successfully grow retail bank households and increased our primary consumer checking customers which were up 5% from a year ago.
Investment banking declined on overall market weakness and some of our commercial real estate related businesses had weaker results coming off a very strong fourth quarter performance.
Average deposit balances declined $3.7 billion from a year ago, reflecting lower international deposits from market volatility and the competitive rate environment.
The year-over-year results reflect a strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up 14% offset by the impact of weak equity market conditions on fee income.
Balance sheet growth remained strong with average deposits up 8% from a year ago and loans up 13%, the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth with continued growth in non-conforming mortgage loans and securities based lending.
Credit results continued to benefit from our diversified portfolio with only 38 basis points of annualized net charge-offs.
As I mentioned earlier, we had a $200 million reserve build during the quarter as continued improvements in our residential real estate portfolio were more than offset by higher oil and gas reserves.
Our total oil and gas loan exposure which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding was down $1.3 billion or 3% from the fourth quarter with declines across all three sectors.
Our consistent focus on executing on our vision continued to benefit our fundamental drivers of long term growth, including adding customers, loans and deposits while maintaining our strong capital position.
That's part one, and then part two is in terms of broader M&A, because of your size and favored nation status you're the kind of preferred name for news reporters and others that speculate on M&A for big financial companies, and since a lot's changed around the environment the last few years, can you just remind us your strategy around M&A, maybe how it's different than when you were smaller and how Dodd-Frank and Too Big To Fail might affect your view on acquisitions going forward?

wellsfargo,q2,2016,"Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions.
Our diversified business model and continued focus on meeting our customer's financial needs drove our performance in the second quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion.
We produced strong performance during a period that has had - has included persistent low rates, market volatility and economic volatility, and we did it by focusing on the core building blocks of long-term shareholder value creation, that is growing relationships, loans, investments and deposits.
However, compared to our large bank peers, it should have a much lower direct impact on our long-term business drivers because as you know we are largely a US centric company and many indicators point to continued relative strength in the US economy.
Compared with the first quarter, we had strong loan and deposit growth, we increased net interest income by growing earning assets.
While our earnings were down $161 million from a year ago, our results in the second quarter last year included a $350 million reserve release while this quarter we had a $150 million reserve build primarily due to loan growth in commercial, auto and the credit card portfolios.
With the expectation of rates remaining lower-for-longer, we grew our investment securities portfolio by $18.5 billion, with $38 billion of gross purchases in the second quarter significantly higher than the $5 billion repurchases last quarter and higher than the $26 billion of average quarterly purchases last year.
As we highlighted at Investor Day we expect that we will need to increase our portfolio of qualifying TLAC by approximately $50 billion in order to be compliant including a 100 basis point buffer which we plan to complete through measured issuance over the phase-in period of approximately five years.
We grew net interest income $66 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by long growth including the full quarter benefit of the assets acquired from GE Capital.
The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the first quarter primarily due to growth in long-term debt and deposits and reduced income from investment securities.
We grew net interest income in the second quarter by 4% from a year ago even with 11 basis point reduction in NIM.
While total non-interest income decreased $99 million from the first quarter, we had growth in many areas that reflect our focus on key business drivers including increases in service charges on deposit accounts, brokerage fees, trust and investment management, investment banking, card fees, gains on mortgage loan originations, trading gains on higher customer accommodation activity, and lease income reflecting the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition.
Total mortgage banking revenue which includes both the gain on the sale from originations and servicing income declined $184 million from the first quarter.
Since Brexit and the related decrease in mortgage rates, weÂve seen refinance activity increase with our retail application volumes up approximately 15% to 20% in recent weeks and we currently expect origination volume to be somewhat higher in the third quarter compared with the second quarter.
The decline also reflected the gain from the sale of the crop insurance business recognized last quarter and the gain on the sale of our health benefits services business in the second quarter with a net impact from these sales of $91 million lower other income compared with the first quarter.
This line highlights just a few examples that weÂve recently announced, weÂre working on additional products and services within our innovation group that are scheduled to be released over the coming quarters that we believe will add tangible long-term value for our customers and shareholders.
Turning to our business segment starting on page 14; community banking earned $3.2 billion in the second quarter, down 1% from a year ago and 4% from the first quarter.
Average deposit balances declined $6.6 billion from a year ago, driven by lower international deposits from market volatility and our pricing discipline in the competitive rate environment.
Net charge offs increased $38 million from the first quarter including an increase of $59 million from our oil and gas portfolio which was partially offset by $46 million of lower consumer real estate losses.
As I mentioned earlier, we had $150 million reserve build during the quarter primarily related to long growth in the commercial, auto and credit card portfolios.
Overall the performance of our oil and gas portfolio in the second quarter was consistent with our expectations and our experience of managing through many cycles will continue to benefit us and our customers as we move through the remainder of the cycle.
The headwinds from a flatter yield curve and a lower-for-longer rate environment creates challenges for all financial institutions but we will continue to focus on what we can control earning lifelong relationships with our customers which drive our long-term growth opportunities.
Is it continued balance sheet growth, is it even more disciplined expense management, is it growth and fees in businesses where you don't have scale yet, just trying to figure out, Wells always have as a reputation for pulling on levers to support EPS growth and I'm wondering as we look out over the next 12 months what you think are the most impactful ones are?
I think it's all of the above Erika, you mentioned in broad terms the likeliest sources, if rates are going to remain lower, we will work hard at earning asset growth.
Let me just drill down a little bit on the expense side Erika, we operate within our 55% to 59% range on the efficiency ratio, which is, you know that's either at close to or at the top of our industry surely for our large bank peers, weÂve spend a lot of money in the last couple of years around things like compliance and risk management and so forth.
John also mentioned that we continue to look to simplify our business to get more standard and frankly a lot of the investments weÂre making on customer service and consumer convenience has a front-end cost component but a back end benefit.
So it's a good question, and the things that we're balancing are - and readjusting constantly are expectation for what rates are going to do next and whether today is a better or worse entry point then waiting a quarter or waiting longer.
So it's a delicate balance going on all the time, but I would say that weÂre relatively convinced that we may not be this low forever but like we said a year ago our expectation is lower-for-longer at the curve and we're going to keep putting money to work.
WeÂre looking at the total output every quarter we got a laundry list of things that might be seasonal that might be episodic, it could be gains from securities portfolio, weÂve been selling a handful of non-core businesses and some of them have given rise to gains.
But my laundry list is what you guys see back which are market sensitive items that you often call out as unreliably different from quarter to quarter, some of the mortgage activity which can be a little bit more episodic, mortgage hedging activity, this is what some analysts refer to as things that they have a hard time modeling, I mentioned gains on the sale of debt or equity securities.
I look at the last seven, eight years here since our merger our Wachovia, the time of the merger we had something less than $800 billion of deposits, now we are over $1.2 trillion, we've grown deposits even after run-off of those high-priced CDs by $400 billion or $500 billion, weÂre up maybe $100 billion on loans during that period of time, so deposits are far outstripped loans in fact, if you believe lower-for-longer there is going to be a hunger for earning assets.
And while our quarter two might look different recently, if we look at, in our last year, the growth of $51 billion of deposits versus $80 billion of loans if you strip out some of the loans that we purchased, if you look on organic basis weÂre still growing deposits faster.
How do you think about the appropriate level of reserve coverage in auto and card, and do you think the current environment is supportive of a path where charge offs and reserves in those businesses can grow on-line with loans such that the consumer credit provision is not a headwind to your earnings growth.
As we mentioned, we added a little bit to our allowance this quarter and in part it was from consumer credit but that's based on the growth in the portfolio not because of any meaningful change in underlying behavior.
Now we've said earlier that we are happy to provide more reserve more allowance when weÂre growing our loan portfolio thatÂs because it was going to happen as we came out of the period of releases and are moving into a period of net provisioning and growth.
As Bill asked, I don't know if that makes it a real headwind, I think that means the expected case is probably a little bit lower ROI than the existing case for most people who have been benefiting from the best of times in credit but not so meaningfully that it causes us to want to curtail growth based on the way we approach the market, as I mentioned we are happy with our auto growth, weÂve maintained our pricing and our risk discipline.
And John, the 28 basis points John just mentioned to you, there is a lot of Johns here, but for this quarter ex-oil and gas is equal to what it was a year ago.
For non-HQLA, the limitations are different because you are losing the benefit of that liquidity and we've continued to mention the ability to move out of cash or HQLA into risk assets, all things being equal, based on a snapshot as tens of billions of dollars of activity.
We actually went out and did a little bit of incremental funding in the marketplace to have that liquidity set aside and that weÂre allowing that to run off, it was relatively short-term, but it makes sense for us to have ready access to something, some, call it, $200 billion worth of instant liquidity at any point in time.
So itÂs still our plan and our goal and what weÂre telling you is that we intend to grow net interest income, even if there are no rate moves and we're doing it by adding -- by redeploying cash into HQLA and other earning assets, by looking everywhere for customers where we can make quality loans and those are the big items.
And John, the biggest influence that Brexit had on our company was not on, frankly, a direct impact on the way we do business or customer strengthen like that, it really was the big move down in long-term rates.
In regards to your servicing results within the mortgage bank, were there any changes in the way youÂve hedged that asset this quarter or was there something just specific around the rate curve and the movement in the yield curve in the second quarter versus the first quarter that would have caused the hedging gains to be less than expected?
Well, I think we're talking about a couple of hundred million dollars of unreimbursed direct costs in the second quarter and the run rate is probably half of that, looking back over the last several quarters.
What I would point out is that weÂre amortizing premiums on mortgage securities in particular that are highly prepayment sensitive and in this quarter, the net interest margin or net interest dollars negative impact of getting premium book value bonds called away at par was, I think the number is $100 million.
And then on commercial real estate, I mean, I guess letÂs think about both your commentary and data as well as like what the OCC is saying, et cetera, there is just kind of general concern around underwriting standards, but at the same time, the current data around loan growth is pretty good and on charge-offs, kind of bouncing between zero and net recovery.
WeÂre the best frankly in that business and there is a lot of knock-on benefit in terms of the financing that we do, investment banking that we do for those customers, but it is cyclical and it'll follow patterns like the ones that we just talked about in terms of what's going on in different markets.
But as was mentioned earlier by Erika in terms of what might happen or what has to happen, as we grow in the future, it will be earning asset growth, loans and investments, it will be how efficient we are on the expense side of things and then the whole spectrum of non-interest income generating possibilities.
There are more assets changing here, and things are freeing up a little bit and that's going to help with resolutions and weÂve captured the benefit of that in our analysis for what our exposures are, but itÂs true and it was less true a couple of quarters ago.
Net charge offs remained near historical lows at 39 basis points annualized reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio and continued underwriting discipline.
Mary is a 32-year veteran of the financial services industry and has a diverse mix of experiences including retail banking, which will serve her well as she takes the reign of this key business.
Thank you John and good morning everyone.
My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on page 2, then John and I will answer your questions.
Period end commercial loan balances grew $6.3 billion from first quarter, remember the GE Capital acquisition only impacted average loan growth this quarter.
Consumer loans increased $3.6 billion linked quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit card and securities-based lending was partially offset by declines in junior lean mortgages and seasonally lower student lending.
Credit card balances were up $3 billion or 10% reflecting new account openings and increases in active accounts.
Our average deposit cost was 11 basis points, up 1 basis point from first quarter and 3 basis points from a year ago reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain wholesale banking customers.
Our market sensitive results in the second quarter which included strong gains from trading and debt security gains was partially offset by lower equity gains.
Production revenue increased $306 million or 41% reflecting higher originations.
Partially offsetting these declines was an increase of $186 million from outside professional services after typically lower expenses in the first quarter.
While total expenses have increased, weÂve reduced expenses in many categories even as we've grown the balance sheet by acquiring businesses and adding new customers.
We remain focused on providing outstanding customer service and achieved record store customer loyalty scores during the second quarter and the highest year-to-date retail banking household retention in four years.
P2P payments are not new to Wells Fargo with our customers conducted over $10 billion in P2P volume through our SurePay service in 2015.
Credit card purchase volume was $19.4 billion, up 10% from a year ago benefiting from 8% active account growth.
However charge offs for wholesale banking are still historically low with only 27 basis points of net charge offs annualized in the second quarter.
Turning to page 17, credit results continue to benefit from our diversified portfolio with only 39 basis points of annualized net charge offs.
Criticized loans which include non-accrual loans were down $1.7 billion or 17% from first quarter reflecting paydowns, borrowing base upgrades and net charge offs.
Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Yes. We have a reasonably large allocation to single-family home loan real estate -- residential real estate today because of our jumbo portfolio, which we continue to want to make room for as we serve those customers going forward.
Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.
Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.

wellsfargo,q3,2016,"Thank you for joining our call today where our President and CEO, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions.
We have a specific action plan in place to lead our company forward during this period, which is focused on outreach to everyone who has been impacted by retail banking sales practices, including our customers, our team members, our investors, our regulators, elected officials, and the communities that we do business in.
And let me clarify that these accounts had a de minimis impact to the retail banking household cross-sell ratio that we report on a quarterly basis with the maximum impact in any one quarter of 0.02 products per household or 0.3% of the reported metric.
We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of doing what is right for our customers and the elimination of product sales goals has been positively received by both our team members and our customers.
WeÂre reaching out to all retail and small business checking, savings, credit card, and unsecured line of credit customers, and weÂre asking them to contact us if they have any concerns about their accounts or any aspect of the relationship with Wells Fargo.
For consumer credit card customers identified, over half have closed their accounts, in part reflecting the passage of time as some of these accounts were opened five years ago.
For example, if the loan was from Wells Fargo, and the customer was impacted by a lower FICO score, we will adjust the line size, modify pricing, and refund any additional costs incurred.
Our deposit customers continue to use their accounts with balances up $6.5 billion in September compared with August and debit card transactions up 9% from a year ago.
We continue to see increased usage among our customers with active cards up 9%, balances up 10%, and transaction volume also up 10% from a year ago.
Overall, we did not see any meaningful change of business trends in wholesale banking late in the quarter and deposit balances were up 4% during the month of September and loan pipelines were in line with the second quarter.
And last year, we invested $300 million in team member training in credit, risk, technology and customer service.
I want to start on page 13 with a few key takeaways from our third quarter results, which reflect the benefit of our diversified business model and the momentum across many of our businesses.
The slight decline in non-interest income was driven by a $303 million reduction in market sensitive revenue, which is at its lowest level in the past five quarters and a decrease in other income reflecting the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business last quarter.
As highlighted on page 19, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the third quarter, up $62.6 billion or 5% from a year ago and included 8% growth in consumer and small business banking deposits.
The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by growth in long-term debt and deposits, partially offset by the benefit of earning asset growth.
Non-interest income declined $53 million from the second quarter, which included a $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business and declined $42 million from a year ago, which included $780 million of higher gains from equity investments.
Across a number of our fee businesses, we had the best results in five quarters, including deposit accounts, trust and investment, mortgage banking and lease income.
Turning to our business segments starting on page 25, community banking earned $3.2 billion in the third quarter, down 9% from a year ago and up 2% from the second quarter.
Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, up 6% from a year ago and down 1% from the second quarter.
Revenue was $7.1 billion, down 2% from the second quarter due to the gain last quarter on the sale of our health benefits services business.
Revenue benefited from record net interest income, up 4% from second quarter and 12% from a year ago.
WeÂre working closely with our customers, our regulators and our team members to move forward and make things right.
However, our board is conducting an independent investigation into our retail banking sales practices and related matters and weÂre not in a position to discuss those topics today.
First, in our retail banking business, weÂll continue our outreach efforts to our customers and focus on making things right.
And third, as youÂve heard on the call today, weÂre committed to being transparent regarding business trends and you should expect updates on these activities during the quarter.
Matt, the blurb really reflected the fact that weÂre moving approximately 2,000 of our team members that are in risk and control positions within our business lines to our corporate risk functions.
So, I guess, the broader question is, thereÂs going to be some cost impact of the sales practice issue, probably some revenue impact as well.
The bigger picture, of course, some people have asked is, what will the business model feel like in community banking with a more service oriented culture rather than a more sales oriented culture.
ItÂs our intention to to be successful in providing all of our customers with what they need in terms of financial products through a service oriented model.
And then it will work its way in over the course of the coming quarters, but itÂs a question that people have asked and itÂs one that weÂll provide a lot of transparency around, so that people can understand the impact of that change as itÂs being made.
And I guess, really what the question is, is given the uncertainty of the community bank impact on revenue and expenses going forward, are there other levers within Wells Fargo in that you can deliver that 1.1% to 1.4% ROA within the next two years and can you grow earnings without any help from macro next year despite this uncertainty?
But as John indicated, it's a little bit sooner to rate in terms of what the impact, the longer-term impact of the sales practices issues are going to be within community banking.
And, of course, now in addition to what we just talked about with Matt about compliance costs, weÂre going to have incremental operating losses as a result of this litigation etc.
And my second Â my follow-up question, part of your stockÂs appeal has always been the dividend and the overall capital return, and I'm wondering if some of the overhang from these issues from litigation, from potential DoJ investigation impact how you think about capital return going forward?
Betsy, I saw an executive with decades of experience in the financial services industry and decades of experience at Wachovia and Wells Fargo, who's been through a variety of challenges in her career and who is an incredibly effective leader and somebody who I believe in, and our entire senior leadership team and the board believe, that who can effectuate the change that is needed on our retail banking platform.
And that change, I think, I want to just reinforce is very important because what we've done is we've brought together all of the payments businesses, how so many of our customers, both retail and commercial, interact with us every day, we brought them all together.
One of the benefits that we have at Wells Fargo is that we have these diversified set of businesses, and so frequently in our list of 90 different businesses, not every one of them is necessarily material in any one quarter to the impact of the company.
But weÂre going to work hard to make things right within the company to earn that business back over time.
And then separately, the offsets that could come on the expense side to those types of items, I believe you allude to branch consolidation potential later on in your slide deck as well as the travel that you flagged on your comments, so wanted to see how we could think about the timing of that type of relief from those items.
So think about our bankers being incented to provide good service, and so weÂll be measuring that on an independent basis, to think about our bankers being focused on helping our customers do more business, but being measured on product usage and activity as opposed to individual product sales and also about an overall growth in assets and balances and also think about it being much more driven to a team approach as opposed to just on an individual basis.
And then, so a follow-up for John, on the net interest margin and net interest income, when we try to assess the impact of what a potential rate hike would do, one rate hike, itÂs hard to discern what happened after the December hike last time because the first quarter, you had a few moving parts.
I guess, a follow-up, this is a long wind-up here, but itÂs a little frustrating not getting that retention [indiscernible] the customers that were impacted the most, whatÂs been your retention rate.
And thatÂs one of the reasons why we want to accelerate the timing of our investor day because we want to provide increased transparency which weÂve done today and we want to provide a more continuous updates as to how we are operating the company.
I think, overall, in the wholesale businesses, as you said, every quarter can be a little bit different in terms of loan growth.
Having said that, like all facets of our retail banking business, weÂre going to review those.
I think credit cards it's a little bit tricky just because over the last few years weÂve seen such gross in our credit card business in terms of penetration and our usage numbers have been good.
And, again, as it relates to the deposit accounts Â and, John, jump in here if you feel differently Â weÂre so new into the impact.
And then not to Monday morning quarterback or rehash what you've done in the past, but, Tim, I really wanted to ask you, what, in this experience, has changed the way you think about the role of CEO, as you now assume it, and Wells Fargo as a company or a culture?
When I think about the retail sales practices issues weÂve had at the company, I wish that the business had escalated the issues sooner.
And I highlight that because I think that one of the lessons that I've learned Â one of the lessons the entire company has learned and one of the reasons that weÂre organized the way we are today and weÂre making many of the changes that weÂve talked about are that we've got to escalate issues wherever they occur within the company sooner.
I think I mentioned earlier, in CCAR, our own stress analysis, we concoct and imagine outsized op risk outcomes to demonstrate that weÂve got the capital and earnings power to overcome them and the magnitude of what weÂre talking about here frankly, Â while itÂs significant, is modest in comparison to what you can imagine in stress, both in our own scenario as well as in CCAR.
ItÂs the month when our team members were probably the most uncertain in terms of what the go forward model is going to be as we pivot toward service.
We want to arm our team members with the right incentives and have them work together and provide a good advice and service to our customers and make sure that weÂve got great products out there.
ItÂs absolutely appropriate to step back and think about all aspects of how we provide product and service and convenience to our customers.
I think this year, in fact, thereÂs going to be a reduction unrelated to what weÂve talked about here.
But, look, the company Â when I think about the company that I joined 29 years ago, itÂs so different today.
So, no, fair point that itÂs probably a little bit more tactical and strategic, but over time you'll see some updates and we'll talk about those over the next few months and I'm sure we'll talk about some of that at Investor day next year.
But I really want to thank all of you for your thoughtful questions, the discussion I think has been incredibly helpful for both John and me and we look forward to continuing to provide additional disclosure to you as we move through the quarter.
[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations.
This action demonstrates the dedication John has had to Wells Fargo throughout his 34 years with the company, including successfully leading us through the financial crisis and the largest merger in banking history.
Effective October 1, we eliminated product sales goals for our retail banking team members; and next year, we will introduce a new performance plan based on updated metrics around customer service, growth, and risk management.
There are a lot of reasons why customers don't activate their cards, so weÂre trying to contact all unactivated credit card customers with open accounts to confirm whether they want their credit cards.
WeÂre also focused on determining potential additional impacts that the identified consumer and small business deposit and credit card customers may have incurred.
WeÂre working on determining potential financial impact for customers who obtained a loan with Wells Fargo or another company during the 12-month period where their FICO score may have been impacted by the credit inquiry.
When analyzing these trends versus the prior month, itÂs important to remember that September had two fewer business days this year than August.
While it is too early to determine the long-term impact, and weÂre prepared for things to get worse before they get better, here's what weÂve observed so far.
The drivers of lower banker interactions also resulted in new consumer checking account openings declining 25% in September compared with openings in September a year ago.
Lower referrals, marketing and product offerings also impacted credit card applications, which were down 20% in September compared with September a year ago.
Applications were down 77,000 from a year ago compared with 7.8 million total active cards.
September closed referred investment assets Â these are the referrals resulting from the Wells community banking partnership Â were more than $1 billion, in line with prior trends.
We are also assisting former team members who left retail banking due to sales performance and who remain eligible for rehire and applying for available positions at the company.
Mary Mack, who was the new head of community banking, has met with team members in ten cities so far to gather ideas, concerns and questions from frontline retail managers at all levels to help inform the go-forward strategy for a service-driven community bank.
Many of our businesses had their best non-interest income results in five quarters, including strong mortgage banking results.
Credit quality improved including lower losses in our oil and gas portfolio and our capital position remains strong as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders.
Our average deposit cost was stable with second quarter at 11 basis points and up 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain wholesale banking customers.
As shown on page 23, expenses increased $402 million from the second quarter, driven by $243 million of higher operating losses, reflecting increased litigation accruals.
Operating losses could continue to increase related to outstanding legal matters such as sales practice issues as weÂve disclosed in our 10-K filing RMBS.
While our expenses increased this quarter, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth, which we highlight on page 24.
WeÂre also working on creating a simpler and more collaborative way to seamlessly serve customers and team members by aligning similar teams in areas like marketing, finance and operations.
This new group will bring teams from across the company together to accelerate our focus on delivering the next generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings and investing in new customer experiences and products.
This new group includes our innovation, consumer credit card, deposit products, treasury management and virtual channels teams.
WeÂre also making it easier for our customers to open accounts through mobile channels including brokerage, business direct, and personal credit products.
We've already discussed earlier on the call, many of the business trends within community banking, so I'll just briefly highlight that our customers continued to actively use our payment and digital products with debit card transaction volume up 8% from a year ago and credit card purchase dollar volume also up 8%.
Client assets across WIM reached record highs this quarter driven both by market gains and continued positive net flows.
Turning to page 28, credit results improved from second quarter with only 33 basis points of annualized net charge-offs.
Net charge-offs declined $119 million or from second quarter from lower oil and gas, credit card and consumer real estate losses, and continued commercial real estate recoveries.
Non-performing assets decreased $1.1 billion from second quarter with improvement across our consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
As Tim mentioned, weÂre going to have an off-cycle investor day next May. And if we think that those arenÂt reasonable guideposts anymore, weÂll tell people.
Hey, good morning.
Tim, I know it's early here, but maybe you could talk about what factors are you going to be balancing when you redesign the sales incentive scorecard?
Hey, good morning, guys.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research.
I think we have deposits growing by $6 billion when we have new accounts not opening as quickly.
Brian, thatÂs another reason why we want to continue to provide enhanced disclosure because we want to make sure that you are comfortable with how any of the headwinds weÂre facing right now are affecting business.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
ItÂs the month when our customers and prospects are first reflecting their real dissatisfaction with Wells Fargo, all those things put together.
And Tim mentioned that weÂre going to roll this forward probably during the quarter, so people can see whether October looks like September and November looks like October and then we can start to build a projectable impact on the trend.
I think Â weÂre focused less on size because size is ultimately determined by our customers.
Having said that, weÂve looked at across the company and youÂve seen us exit some businesses that we believed would not provide us with as strong return as they might provide another owner.
Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.
Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.
I think weÂre still going to approach every client relationship with an emphasis on every client having a customized plan that guides their investment activity.

wellsfargo,q4,2016,"Our results in 2016 demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with loan and deposit balances at an all-time high while we maintained a strong risk discipline.
On Page 3 we describe the progress weÂve made on our retail banking sales practices remediation plan, including contacting our retail and small business customers and encouraging anyone who has concerns to contact us.
Customers are increasingly coming into our branches including a modest increase in banker interactions which started in the last two weeks of November and continued through year-end.
Our existing customers have continued to use their accounts and weÂve seen higher deposit and credit card balances and increased credit and debit card transaction volume which drives near-term revenue.
As weÂve previously discussed as part of our overall asset/liability management program, we typically swap our fixed rate long term debt to floating rate in order to balance our deposit oriented liability structure and better align with the interest rate sensitivity characteristics of our assets.
Deposit growth was also strong up $30.2 billion from third quarter with increases in commercial, consumer and small business banking balances and our short term borrowings declined $27.9 billion reflecting lower repurchase balances.
Non-interest income declined $1.2 billion driven by net hedging ineffectiveness, accounting losses, as well as lower trading and mortgage banking results which I will discuss later.
Consumer and small business banking deposits increased 8% from a year ago.
Net interest margin increased five basis points from the third quarter driven by growth in earning assets including deployment of cash into investments and the net benefit from higher interest rates.
Mortgage banking results decreased $250 million from third quarter and included a $163 million decline in mortgage servicing income primarily due to higher unreimbursed servicing costs.
As a result we increased our estimated cost to resolve these properties in the fourth quarter, however we expect these actions will reduce unreimbursed servicing costs significantly in 2017.
On Page 17 we highlight the five quarter trend across major fee categories, compared with a year ago many of our fee businesses grew including deposit accounts, brokerage, investment banking, card and mortgage originations.
This page illustrates that while many businesses had above average results in the fourth quarter, total non-interest income reflected below average mortgage servicing income and lower market sensitive revenue which was down $526 million from a year ago.
WeÂve been working on a number of initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion annually by year-end 2018 with the full year benefits starting in 2019.
Let me take some time to discuss our branch strategy in more detail, itÂs along with each and every business within the company as part of our focus on discretionary spending.
We will be providing more details on our branch distribution strategy at our May Investor Day. WeÂve already discussed many of the business trends within community banking, so I won't go into any more details here.
Fourth quarter results reflected strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up 14% from a year ago.
WIM total client assets reached a record high in the fourth quarter of $1.7 trillion, up 7% from a year ago driven by higher market valuations and continued positive net flows.
We once again earned more than $5 billion in the quarter demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model which continued to perform well during a period where we faced unique challenges.

Thank you for joining our call today where our President and CEO, Tim Sloan and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions.
In general, while account openings are still down from a year ago, customers continue to actively use their accounts and many of the trends have shown improvements from the lows earlier in the fourth quarter.
The decline in the rate of new account openings may impact the pace of future revenue growth, so weÂll continue to be transparent regarding those trends.
We had solid underlying performance in the quarter including a record level of loans and deposits and strong growth in net interest income.
It's important to note that our results in the quarter included the loss of $592 million or $0.07 a share from the impact of net hedge ineffectiveness accounting.
Consumer loans were reduced by the $3.8 billion deconsolidation of certain previously sold reverse mortgage loans following the sale of the related servicing in the fourth quarter.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 10, while revenue declined from the third quarter we had strong growth in net interest income up $450 million and our NIM increased 5 basis points.
As highlighted on Page 13, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $67.4 billion or 6% from a year ago with growth in both commercial and consumer deposits.
Net interest income was up $450 million or 4% from the third quarter reflecting growth in loans and investment securities, higher interest incomes on trading assets and higher income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and fees.
Non-interest income declined $1.2 billion from the third quarter including the $592 million of net hedge ineffectiveness accounting losses as well as lower trading and mortgage banking fees.
Net trading activities declined due to a $223 million decrease in secondary trading, reflecting lower client volumes compared with the strong third quarter as well as seasonality, fewer trading days in the fourth quarter and lower client demand as clients adapted to the rising rate environment.
As shown on Page 18 expenses declined $53 million from the third quarter, but our efficiency ratio increased to 61.2% primarily driven by the impact of net hedge ineffectiveness losses on our revenue.
Turning to our business segments starting on Page 21, community banking earned $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter down 14% from a year ago and down 15% from third quarter.
TheyÂre captured in this calculation of our rate sensitivity and so if you think about LIBOR based commercial loans as the hedged item there those wonÂt float up and that incremental benefit won't be passed along in the near term as a result of the choice to fix those out and to earn higher interest income in previous periods and to change their profile.
Things have changed clearly, and expectations have changed, but the efficiency ratio is a function of not only your expense rate, but also revenue growth and we're hopeful that we'll continue to grow revenue overtime as we did over the last year in 2016.
And our guidance is that, in the short term as revenue continues to grow and we continue to have some headwinds from an expense standpoint and the first quarter is going to be a good example of that because we'll have some impact from annual incentive compensation impact and so on, that weÂll going to be at the high end, and again we think about this expense ratio -- our efficiency ratio, excuse me, not on our quarterly basis, but as much year-over-year.
The big sources, setting mortgage aside because we talked about it a little bit in the prepared comments and I think you just nailed it, weÂre in that lower point in the refi cycle.
In our other big sources, deposit, deposit service charges, our customers are using our products more than ever, so weÂve had good growth in debit card and weÂll continue to work there and now we need to continue to attract new customers to the bank in order for that to grow like it has in the past, that is an area of focus for Mary as she launches her new program in community banking and of course a lot of that also comes from the commercial side of things where weÂre a leader in providing treasury management services to our corporate customers as well.
And then with respect to brokerage, obviously weÂre at high market levels right now so we expect good fees from that as well as institutional asset management, but with David CarrollÂs teams focus on meeting the saving for retirement and investing needs of all of our banking customers, my sense is that there continues to be an opportunity there also.
Yeah, I would just reinforce the opportunity we have in wealth and investment management, as John said David and team did a terrific job last year and when you think about growing that business 10% year-over-year and just couldnÂt be more pleased with those performance.
Because you never know where a dollar of revenue is going to come from and especially on the non-interest income side, the mix matters in terms of what itÂs related expenses are and so I wouldnÂt be predicting a couple of years forward what that mix is going to look like or what the associated expense impact is going to look like at the margins from a dollar of one sort of non-interest income versus another, I would think about it as these are undertakings that we have going on to accomplish all of our incremental spending and still stay in 55% to 59% on an annual basis.
I would just reinforce JohnÂs comment, just to think about that 55% to 59% that weÂre going to save a lot of money here at Wells Fargo, and weÂre going to reinvest that business for the long-term that will pay benefits well beyond the next couple of years.
I do think itÂs reasonable though to say to get to the lower end of the range itÂs going to be because of the impact of higher rates on interest income.
There is no question that there have been certain rules and regulations that have been promulgated over the last eight years which have impacted and provided some concern in the industry not just with big banks in terms of how we provide credit, some of it is related to the fact that we all, weÂre part of servicing settlements that went back decades almost and which were a surprise to everybody.
That the volumes has exceeded our expectations and so weÂre just really pleased with the fact that weÂve had a very strong origination year and you know the credit quality within the mortgage businesses has just continued to exceed our expectations.
So weÂre really pleased with the position that we have in the mortgage business weÂre hopeful that the new administration can continue to provide clarification in terms of that business and we look forward to working with them.
Lower turnover means lower training cost, it means a higher productivity because you've got more experienced bankers, tellers, service folks, that are working with our customers, so net-net overtime making this decision we think is a net positive for the company so we really don't look at it as gosh it's going to have this kind of an impact in a certain period of time, because the other outcomes that I mentioned aren't really known until we look back a year from now.
So our strategy is really based upon listening to customers and looking at their habits and how they want to interact with us and based upon that we think it makes sense and MaryÂs has had an opportunity to oversee the business for the last six months and what weÂve concluded is that we should increase the pace of rationalization to about 200 this year.
But, when I think about the fundamentals of the plan, they were reviewed by Mary and team, we had a lot of discussions with the retail folks, we had it reviewed by our risk folks and HR folks and the likes, and just the fundamentals of basing it on customer service, increasing in primary accounts and household growth, I mean those are all measurable items.
Recall that in 2014 we made a number of changes in terms of how we provide information to our customers, how we process payments and deposits and debits and credits and the like, which meant that our deposit or our overdraft income actually declined in 2015 to 2014 and so the year-over-year, again three quarters to three quarters comparison you're seeing '16 to '15 is a reflection of the changes we made in '14, revenue decline in '15 and then growing off that number and the reason itÂs growing is not because there's anything nefarious that we're doing or it's part of any sort of retail sales practices issue.
We think maybe our competitors are making some of the changes that we made a year later and so maybe that's impacting some of their overdraft revenue, but we'll -- I'll be responsive to the letter when I get it and we'll continue to provide the right services to our customer base.

wellsfargo,q1,2017,"Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions.
We generated $22 billion in revenue, reflecting lower fee income from a year ago, which was partially offset by a 5% increase in net interest income.
Cash and short-term investments reached an all-time high of $328.4 billion, up $41.7 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth in deposits and a linked quarter decline in the loan portfolio.
Turning to the income statement overview on Page 7, I will be describing the biggest drivers of revenue and expense growth later on the call, so there was a couple of things Â points I want to make here.
As shown on Page 8, average loans increased 4% from a year ago, but declined $502 million from the fourth quarter as $5 billion of broad based growth in commercial loans was more than offset by declines in consumer loans, primarily in residential real estate.
The benefit from higher rates increased average loan yields 6 basis points in the quarter.
We had continued declines in our oil and gas portfolio, which was down 29% from a year ago and down $2 billion or 14% from the fourth quarter.
Our first mortgage loans declined $946 million from the fourth quarter due to continued runoff of higher yielding legacy portfolios, more than offsetting $4.1 billion of growth in non-conforming mortgage loans.
We will show more Â we will share more about our auto strategy at Investor Day. As highlighted on Page 11, our first quarter average deposits were a record $1.3 trillion, up $79.8 billion or 7% from a year ago with growth in both consumer and commercial deposits.
Our average deposit costs increased 7 basis points from a year ago and 5 basis points from the fourth quarter.
Net interest income increased 5% from a year ago, primarily driven by growth in loans and investment securities and the benefit of higher interest rates.
The net interest margin was flat from the fourth quarter as the benefit of higher interest rates, a reduction in short-term market funding and growth in average investment securities was offset by lower income from trading assets and mortgages held for sale, higher deposit and long-term debt balances and lower income from variable sources.
Non-interest income increased $522 million from the fourth quarter, driven by a lower net hedge ineffectiveness accounting impact in the fourth quarter as well as higher trading gains.
As shown on Page 15, expenses increased $577 million from the fourth quarter and $764 million from a year ago and our efficiency ratio increased to 62.7%.
As we discussed last quarter, we have been working on a number of initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion annually by year end 2018, with the full year benefit starting in 2019.
Turning to our business segments starting on Page 19, community banking earned $3 billion in the first quarter, down 9% from a year ago and up 10% from the fourth quarter.
The decline in non-interest income was driven by the impact from the sale of our crop insurance business last year, which generated a $381 million gain in the first quarter of Â16.
Wealth and investment management earned $623 million in the first quarter, up 22% from a year ago and down 5% for the fourth quarter.
First quarter results reflected strong growth in net interest income, up 14% from a year ago.
The benefit of higher market valuations and continued positive net flows led to another quarter of record WIM total client assets, up 9% from a year ago, to $1.8 trillion.
Non-performing assets continued to decline, down $698 million from the fourth quarter, with improvements across our portfolios and lower foreclosed assets.
Now, as it relates to the $2 billion of reductions that we have talked about previously, again as you highlighted, all those are going to be reinvested in growing the company and making the necessary investments for our success over the long-term.
One thing I would add, I think we will provide some more clarity at Investor Day that the $2 billion that we are talking about reinvesting, we are essentially reinvesting it today, and so there is a little bit ofÂ there needs to be more clarity I think on the Â on just the time element of what happens to the $2 billion to the extent that we are already in an elevated situation.
So where short-term rates are and are going is a big part of it, where long-term rates are matters a lot, because we generate interest income by investing at the longer end of the curve.
Erika, I think itÂs going to be a challenge to do that in terms of averaging that for the year.
When you put all the pieces in, a few moves, loan growth, deposit growth, investment activity, I think that sort of mid single-digit NII growth over the course of the year is a reasonable expectation.
John, my suggestion is we will provide you with more detail on that at Investor Day. I think there is Â thatÂs not a significant part of this $2 billion.
Along the lines of what John McDonald was just asking about, I just want to dig a little bit deeper on that side around expenses, whether it be on the branch side, 200 a year and also just looking at the size of the bank in the different businesses and the different markets you are in.
Yes, John, I would look forward to that at Investor Day. I mean, just to reinforce, right, 62.7% efficiency ratio, even taking out the seasonality in the first quarter is too high.
WeÂve got a $2 billion expense initiative that we have talked about a little over the last few quarters that is primarily focused on reinvesting for the long-term.
In addition to that, we appreciate that we have got to improve our operating efficiency Â our expense efficiency ratio and you will see more about that in Investor Day and you should expect a bigger number.
I had a question last quarter, you mentioned that you had proactively decided to keep I think itÂs the non-bank balance sheet in line with September 30 levels, I am just wondering if you persisted in that this quarter?
So I think we mentioned that in part, our net interest income was impacted to about $100 million for our average trading assets being lower.
I think the way that I would maybe try to categorize things is that the sale Â retail sales practices issues primarily impacted our retail banking business.
But I think the rest of the bank is continuing to perform well and the retail bank business is really performing better than the lowest points in the fourth quarter and the first quarter.
What I am trying to get at is, is there revenue thatÂs being suppressed from all of this, because there is a lot of metrics out there that itÂs hard to translate some of these retail banking metrics into revenues, the existing customer base seems to be performing well, if we look at your credit card balances overall, the fee revenues, so I think part of the pieces [ph] on the stock would be that you are under-earning now because of some of these issues impacting both revenue and expenses and I am just trying to square a lot of disclosures that are out there with that and again, you have provide us some metrics on the revenue expense, which is helpful, but thatÂs really the angle that I am coming from?
So itÂs not Â we donÂt want to get away from that, the fact that we think that we can continue to grow this company.
And then a bigger picture question related to the theme just in terms of how much time is senior management still spending on kind of all of these issues and you can include from a regulatory perspective thatÂs new in the last six months, the sales practices, if you had a percentage that you had to put on how much time you, John and the business has put towards this.
And then the same question for the line staff, because I would think at this point, the line staff is maybe starting to turn the page in terms of looking ahead more, but just trying to get a sense of maybe how things really feel inside at the different layers?
For example, we talked about the fact publicly that we established the rebuilding trust office, meaning that we didnÂt want lots of people to be spending 10% and 15% of their time on some of these issues.
And thatÂs what we are wrestling with, especially now that rates have rallied back and it looks less likely that sort of the investable part of the curve that we are talking about is going to be substantially higher in the future.
But I guess what I am getting at is how you think about balancing all those things in light of the sales fraud issues and the fallout from that and whether you think it is adversely impacting your ability to achieve positive operating leverage in terms of the magnitude and the timing of that in terms of pulling the cost lever maybe a little bit harder doing things like rationalizing branches.
I mean I think that when you step back and you look at the Â how serious the retail sales practice issues were and the reputational impact on the company, you can only reach that conclusion, right.
ItÂs had an impact in reference to MattÂs question about the time that we are spending in various activities, but I think itÂs making us a better company.
Having said that, hindsight is incredibly valuable when you look back at the reputational risk, reputational impact on the company and I think that based on the information that we had at the time, I think we made the appropriate decisions in terms of our disclosures.
But I think that the changes and the decision that we made over last 6 months has reinforced kind of the long-term view of how we manage credit at this company.
John, you spent a lot of time about the OCI and the work you guys have done there, have you had any success in trying to figure out how much, based on what the FedÂs balance sheet is today, $4.5 trillion and the talk of the unwinding thatÂs coming down the road maybe the next 12 months, do you guys have any estimate of what you think the impact on the 10-year government bond yield is due to the daily buying that the Fed does to maintain that $4.5 trillion balance sheet?
Over the long-term, we are going to do that and thatÂs what we will Â we will talk about that efficiency more at Investor Day. You said you are seeing progress in the retail bank, but you are not back to pre-settlement levels.
And so we certainly could imagine an environment where, letÂs say, the rate of new primary checking growth in Community Banking may be lower than pre-settlement levels, but the value and therefore the revenue impact over time might be higher.
It has been 7 months since the retail sales practices settlements, and we continued to take important steps in making things right with our customers and rebuilding trust.
This commitment has been demonstrated through our improving retail banking customer service scores, record client assets in wealth and investment management, including banker-closed referrals once again reaching $1 billion a month, more primary consumer checking customers and industry leading mortgage originations during the quarter.
We will talk more about specific areas of cost saves and reinvestments at our Investor Day in May. March retail banking customer activity is shown on Slide 3, which we have been updating monthly since October.
Starting with customer interactions on an average per day basis, total branch interactions declined 6% from February and declined 4% from a year ago.
And activity among our debit and credit card customers also remained strong, with debit card transactions and consumer credit purchase Â consumer credit card purchase volume both up 5% from a year ago on an average per day basis.
New consumer credit card applications increased 10% from February on an average per day basis, the largest month-over-month increase in September, but were still down from a year ago.
Point-of-sale active consumer credit card accounts were up 4% from a year ago.
We implemented our new retail banking compensation program early in the first quarter and initial survey results from our team members have been positive.
Another important step forward we are making is the launch of a new marketing campaign next week called Building Better Every Day. Also during the first quarter, our board accelerated its ongoing process of board refreshment by electing two talented new independent directors, Karen Peetz and Ron Sargent, to succeed long-serving board members.
We want Wells Fargo to be the financial services leaders Â leader in these six areas; customer service and advice, team member engagement, innovation, risk management, corporate citizenship and long-term shareholder value.
We will share our specific strategies we are taking to help achieve these goals at our Investor Day. There was a lot of economic volatility and uncertainty over this period and these steady results reflected the benefit of our diversified business model and its ability to perform consistently over time.
Period end loans grew 1% from a year ago and declined $9.2 billion or 1% from the fourth quarter.
Our commercial customers are generally optimistic about the current environment and this positive sentiment should lead to more loan growth as business activity and investing increase.
The commercial real estate portfolio increased $189 million in the fourth quarter with growth in the commercial real estate construction, which was diversified across geographies and asset types, partially offset by declines in commercial real estate mortgages, driven by pay-downs.
Our credit card portfolio declined $2 billion from the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonal activity as customers paid down their holiday purchases.
The $1.9 billion decline in our auto portfolio reflected lower origination volumes, which were down 29% compared with a year ago.
The benefit from the interest rate increases as well as growth in average investment securities was offset by lower average trading assets and mortgages held for sale and typically lower first quarter income from variable sources.
Mortgage servicing income increased $260 million from the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower un-reimbursed servicing costs and lower prepayments.
We took actions last year that increased these un-reimbursed servicing costs, primarily in the fourth quarter.
Incentive compensation was up $80 million from a year ago, with approximately 40% of the increase from higher revenue-related incentive compensation costs.
The first quarter included approximately $80 million of expense related to sales practices matters and meaningful spending on regulatory and compliance initiatives, including regulatory and risk data, resolution planning and Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs.
These higher expenses were partially offset by $172 million of lower operating losses on lower litigation accruals in the first quarter compared with a year ago.
The primary driver of our ratio remaining above our internal target this quarter was lower RWA than last quarter and lower than forecasted in our 2016 capital plan, resulting from loan growth trends, continued credit discipline and improved RWA efficiency.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
I just have a clarification question, you both mentioned on the call in the prepared remarks that the 62.7% efficiency ratio is not acceptable, but youÂve also emphasized that the $2 billion currently identified cost savings wonÂt fall to the bottom line and your NII was down in a period where the Fed raised rates in December by 25 bps, so how do we square future efficiency ratio improvement from here when those two big pieces seem to be going the other way?
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
John, I wonder if you could talk more about that OCI risk management and the trade-off between that longer part of the curve, when we saw in your 10-K that the unrealized loss component did go up and it seems like you did reinvest a little less this quarter, can you just talk about like the balance between your decision tree on putting more into the book here and versus balance sheet risk and the decision tree between investment securities and maybe keeping more mortgages?
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.

wellsfargo,q2,2017,"Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions.
While it improved from the first quarter, the efficiency ratio is still too high, operating at this level is just not acceptable and we are firmly committed to the goals we provided at Investor Day. As John will discuss later on the call, we are making progress on our ongoing expense initiatives which target $2 billion of expense saves by the end of 2018 that will support our investment in the business and an additional $2 billion of expense saves by the end of 2019 that is expected to go to the bottom line.
And while we are focused on reducing expenses and improving efficiency, we are continuing to invest in our businesses and in particular technologies that make it easier for our commercial and consumer customers to manage their finances.
We are also focused on improving the operating performance of the Company by increasing our emphasis on core banking products and services that we believe are most relevant for our customers and provide the best financial returns for our shareholders.
Before I turn the call over to John to discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to again highlight the efforts of our 271,000 team members who work hard each and every day to fulfill our vision of helping our customers to succeed financially, which results in such strong operating performance for our shareholders.
We had growth across a number of businesses, including $1.1 billion in Government and Institutional Banking, $605 million in Wells Fargo Commercial Capital, $469 million in Global Banking and modest growth in the middle market.
Commercial real estate loans declined $982 million from the first quarter and while we remain the largest CRE lender in the country, our growth has been modestly below that of the industry for the first half of this year.
Our first mortgage loans increased $1.9 billion from the first quarter, reflecting $7.3 billion of growth in non-conforming mortgage loans, partially offset by the continued run-off of higher yielding legacy portfolios, including the sale of $569 million Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio.
As a result of tightening underwriting standards, the quality of originations has improved with the quarterly average FICO of 719 at origination in the second quarter, up from 696 a year-ago.
We expect auto loans to continue to decline in the second half of this year.
The increase from the first quarter reflected the benefit of the repricing of earning assets due to higher short-term interest rates, which exceeded the associated cost of repricing liabilities.
The rate of growth during the second half of the year will be dependent on a variety of factors including the level and slope of the yield curve as well as deposit betas and earning asset growth trends.
Non-interest income declined $743 million from a year-ago, driven by lower market sensitive and mortgage banking revenue, while non-interest income was down only $16 million from the first quarter.
Deposit service charges were down $37 million from the first quarter, reflecting a higher earnings credit rate for commercial customers and lower consumer and business checking service charges.
Mortgage banking non-interest income declined $80 million from the first quarter, residential mortgage origination volume increased $12 billion or 27% from the first quarter on higher purchase volume, reflecting seasonality and a strong purchase market.
We continue to make progress on efficiency initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion annually by year-end 2018 with the full-year benefit starting in 2019.
Turning to our Business segments starting on Page 19, Community Banking earned $3 billion in the second quarter, down 6% from a year-ago and down 1% from the first quarter.
As we discussed at Investor Day, we're making a shift in how we report activity to highlight metrics we believe best show how we're managing the business today and our most important to our long-term success.
As we show on Slide 20, existing customers continue to actively use their accounts, branch and ATM interactions were up 3% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality and we're down 3% from a year-ago.
Primary consumer checking customers increased from a year-ago, although the rate of growth has continued to slow active consumer general purpose credit card accounts were up 2% from both the first quarter from a year-ago.
Wholesale Banking earned $2.4 billion in the second quarter, up 15% from a year-ago and up 13% from the first quarter.
It's also important to note that prior year results included the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business.
Wealth and Investment Management earned a record $682 million in the second quarter, up 17% from a year-ago and up 9% from the first quarter.
Our consumer real estate portfolios both first and second lien mortgages were actually in a net recovery position in the second quarter, demonstrating the significant improvement in the residential real estate market and the quality of loans we put on our balance sheet.
Well, I think Â Betsy that's one of the reasons why we wanted to provide some additional granularity in the slides in terms of where we're seeing loan growth.
I think the loan growth trends continue to be good with the headwind that we're having just in terms of the absolute number being the run-off of the junior lien mortgage portfolio and then the impact from auto.
I just wonder if you could give us a sense as to how you're thinking about the businesses that you want to retain, attract, invest in versus the ones that you are deciding to move away from because frankly, in conversations with investors, the insurance -- that was a bit of a surprise to people, thought was that it was good for CCAR and ROE, albeit had a higher expense ratio.
And then likewise, on the insurance business, recall a couple Â or three years ago, we sold the non-footprint offices in our commercial insurance brokerage business because there just wasn't much connection there with our existing business and as we looked at the insurance business, again it was performing fine, but candidly I think that that it might Â we thought it might work better with others and we're very pleased with the buyer USI.
So a lot of good details on the expenses, the drivers of Â with the $2 billion net will come from I think it's all very helpful and at the back half of the year commentary I think itÂs positive.
Well, for the reasons we've talked about before, it's tough to give an absolute number, because so much of our expense is driven by the business results that are happening in any given quarter because they are related to production levels, et cetera.
What costs are we taking out because there is non-value added, and we're improving the Company and where we signaling that we're going to run the Company over time, 55% to 59% as opposed to a specific dollar, which reflects more assumptions and it's reasonable to make about what our business mix is at that time what our production levels are at that time.
I think in Investor Day, you're kind of targeting low single-digit loan growth for the year in terms of low single-digits, any change there after the results this quarter?
Yes, well, so there's a lot that's going to happen with NIM trajectory and I'd say the biggest drivers to look for Â part of it is earning asset mix and the rate of growth in loans and of course what kind of loans we put on the books.
But at least in the short to medium-term probably more impactful is what's going on with deposit pricing, because we have been outperforming the beta that we showed to you at our Investor Day by a reasonable amount, especially on the consumer and small business side of things.
And so as we sit around and think about the next six to 12 months and what happens with rates and what happens with net interest income whether or not we continue to outperform our modeled expectations on deposit repricing is really one of the big drivers, obviously deposit growth, loan growth, deployment into securities all matter, but I would focus on deposit pricing in the near-term.
I wanted to focus my line of questioning in terms of the revenue progress thatÂs underlying your goal to get back to your efficiency range and maybe it's good to just jump off from KenÂs line of questioning, you mentioned the betas are going to be a big swing factor, and I'm wondering how you're thinking about the sensitivity of outflow in beta as the Fed begins to reduce their balance sheet and how it would impact you specifically?
Erika, just to reinforce JohnÂs point, I think that's why itÂs really important from our perspective to make sure that we're investing in our products and services convenience as John mentioned for our consumer customers that is Â that when you are in an environment where it is uncertain, I mean the Fed has never had a balance sheet of this size.
And the final question just on the fee side, if you take out the gain on the PCI loans, the run rate is something like $9.4 billion and as we're looking forward to efficiency improvement for the second half of the year from the 61%.
Most of them are in line with the five-quarter averages and I'd say mortgage is probably the item to look at in terms of what's the size of the market, what the composition of the market and what's going on with margins that reflects competition.
I think that you're likely to see a continued decline in the auto portfolio through the second half of this year and my bet is it will probably stabilize sometime in the first half of next year.
I think that we're seeing actually some very good results in terms of customer experience and a continued improvement in customer loyalty.
Yes, I wouldn't attribute any of the decline in sales practices, I think again the second quarter tends to have a lot of seasonality in it particularly on the consumer and the wealth side because folks get their tax refunds and then they use them.
We're not trying to be all things to all people, but gosh, if you look over the last five years or so, I think we've been growing those activities that are kind of mid double-digit rate.
And in fact, one example of that is, you saw the growth and balances in the second quarter of $1.1 billion in our Government and Institutional Banking business.
And our expectation is that we will continue to grow this business in the short term.
We had very strong credit results with the net charge-off rate declining to 27 basis points, the lowest level IÂve seen during my nearly 30 years at Wells Fargo reflecting our consistent risk management.
During the second quarter, we rolled out Zelle, a P2P payment platform for 28 million digital customers, provided enhancements for our Treasury Management customers to streamline and automate accounts receivable, launched a chatbot pilot for Facebook Messenger, began the rollout of new streamlined mobile checking account opening experiences for our customers, and launched a new service for commercial card customers that allows them to upload and manage receipts with their mobile device.
This week, we received preliminary court approval for the $142 million settlement agreement for a class action lawsuit concerning retail sales practices, including providing an avenue for customers whose credit was harmed to seek compensation.
So I'll just highlight the decline of 82 million common shares outstanding over the past year, reflecting our strong capital return through a net share repurchases.
This included discrete tax benefits totaling $186 million or approximately $0.04 per share, primarily as a result of our agreement to sell Wells Fargo Insurance Services.
The growth was partially offset by $620 million decline in financial institutions from actions we've taken to lower exposure in certain emerging markets and decreased demand.
Let me explain the $1.9 billion linked quarter decline in consumer loan portfolio in some more detail.
Our junior lien mortgage loan portfolio continued to decline as expected as pay-downs more than offset new originations.
While consumer loan growth will continue to be impacted by the actions we're taking in our auto portfolio and the expected run-off of legacy junior lien mortgage loans, we are making some modest changes to generate new loan originations, including offering interest-only jumbo mortgage loans to high quality borrowers and testing credit card offerings through our digital channels.
While we've implemented some incremental commercial deposit repricing in line with the market was not made material changes in rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits as we've seen very little market response in these categories.
The net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 2.9% driven by higher short-term interest rates, disciplined deposit pricing and a reduction in long-term debt, which were partially offset by the impacts from lower loan and investment securities balances.
However, non-interest income declined $202 million from the first quarter on lower net gains from trading activities.
$81 million of the decline was from lower deferred compensation plan investment results, which was largely offset in employee benefits expense.
Partially offsetting these increases were $152 million of lower revenue related expenses primarily from lower commissions and other incentives in Mortgage and Wholesale Banking.
The Community Banking team continues to work on making changes that will further improve the customer and team member experience.
We highlighted last quarter then in March; we had our first $1 billion month of closed referred investment assets from the partnership between Wealth and Investment Management and Community Banking since the sales practices settlement.
WIM total client assets were a record $1.8 trillion, up 8% from a year-ago, driven by continued positive net flows and higher market valuations.
Non-performing assets continued to decline, down $827 million from the first quarter with improvements across all commercial portfolios and consumer real estate portfolios as well as lower foreclosed assets.
We shared updates throughout the call today on progress we've made toward our goal of being the financial services leader in six areas; customer service and advice, team member engagement, innovation, risk management, corporate citizenship, and long-term shareholder value.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
I mean I think our general assessment is if they start selling long duration assets, I know that there are people who believe that depositors will rush out of bank deposits and rush into mortgages in 10 years.
Yes. So I think mortgage banking could be a little bit more volatile.
Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.
Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
So it's really going to reflect taking business from other people and getting more than our fair share of new household formation or new bank customer formation as it happens over time.
Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
And couple of years ago on Investor Day, we actually had a mortgage banking Â talk about [indiscernible] finally turn the corner after we come out of this financial crisis.
One more thing IÂd add Marty that doesn't show up in the mortgage banking line item, but we're making non-conforming prime jumbo mortgage loans handover for our best customers and then they show up on our balance sheet.

wellsfargo,q3,2017,"Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions.
While this accrual impacted our financial performance in the quarter, the commitment of our team members to put our customers first and help them to succeed financially remains strong and was demonstrated by average deposits growing 4% from a year ago, client assets reaching record levels in wealth and investment management, debit card purchase volume increasing 5% from a year ago, balances in our consumer and general purpose credit card portfolio also growing 5%.
One reason I am confident that we are on the right path is it in the third quarter total team member attrition at Wells Fargo reached its lowest level in over six years.
While branch customer loyalty and satisfaction with most recent visit scores decline slightly in September after our announcement of the completion of the expanded third party account review, both metrics had reached individual post sales practices settlements high earlier in the quarter.
This quarter we did not have a release as improvements and credit performance in certain portfolios were offset by a $450 million of reserve coverage for potential hurricane related losses based on initial review of our portfolio.
H.8 data continue to indicate that there was softness across the industry, particularly in certain categories like C&I, but they're also specific actions that we've taken, primarily driven by our own risk discipline, which have impacted our growth.
Our credit portfolio increased $944 million linked quarter driven by higher spend per active account.
The net interest margin declined 3 basis points to 2.87% as the impact of lower investment portfolio yields driven by accelerated prepayments, lower average loan balances, growth in average deposits and growth in trading assets and related funding were partially offset by lower average long-term debt and a modest benefit from all other growth and repricing.
Card purchase volume increased but card fees declined $19 million from the second quarter due to higher reward expense.
Servicing income declined $91 million from the second quarter primarily due to higher on reimburse direct servicing cost driven by an increased and estimated cost for aged FHA foreclosures while origination volume increased, residential mortgage origination revenue decline due to a lower repurchase reserve release.
Despite decline in customer trading activity, revenue driven by lower volatility and seasonally lower trading volumes, trading related revenue increased $52 million from the second quarter.
The reason why our 2017 efficiency ratio is now expected to be higher than we anticipated last quarter is due to lower than expected earning asset growth and higher than expected expenses, primarily for cyber regulatory initiatives and data modernization.
As you can see on Page 14, we had linked quarter declines across many of our expense categories except for revenue related expenses and running the business non discretionary expenses which is a category impacted by the $1 billion litigation accrual.
The increase in revenue related expenses was primarily due to higher commissions and other incentive compensation driven by wholesale banking and brokerage.
Third party service expense declined $82 million from the second quarter driven by lower project related, legal and outside data processing expense.
Revenue related expense declined $131 million from lower commission and incentive compensation driven by lower mortgage and wholesale banking activity.
On Page 19, we highlight customers continue to actively use their accounts; branch and ATM interactions declined 6% from a year ago.
Primary consumer checking customers declined modestly from the second quarter in a year ago, while our attrition rates have remained stable, the decline in new account openings has impacted primary consumer checking customer growth.
Customer experience survey scores predictably declined after we announced the completion of the expanded third party review of retail banking accounts at the end of August.
It's more than being nice it's offering the right products and services to meet the financial needs of our customers; it's also about making changes with real customer impact for example empowering managers in the branches to immediately resolve some customer issues such as fees and service request rather than having to redirect customers to a call center.
Turning to credit quality on Page 23, the quarterly loss rate was 30 basis points, up 3 basis points from the second quarter but still near historically low levels.
We did not have a reserve build or release this quarter as continued improvement in consumer real estate and commercial loan portfolios including continued improvement in the oil and gas portfolio was offset by a $450 million of reserve coverage for potential hurricane related losses based on an initial review of our portfolio.
Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.
Yes. We've got different categories of earnings assets they are priced differently investment securities loans, short -term investment et cetera.
Can you just talk about end demand and try to separate end demand and customer growth from perhaps any lagging ramification of retail sales and the slower account growth in terms of how you expect loans to traject going forward?
I think the home equity portfolio will also continue to decline though our expectation is that next year all other things being equal will originate more home equity loan than what we did this year.
Even maybe some granularity there in terms of -- I know the specifics that John mentioned but obviously C&I had slowed overall and what do you just seeing in terms of customer demand and where that growth would come from inside that commercial business ?
If you overlay the current economic environment we continue to believe that losses will probably bounce around at lower rate ex things like the impact from the hurricanes but overall the portfolio has never been in any better shape in my 30 years at the company so we continue to be optimistic.
Your next question comes from the lines of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.
I mean you guys definitely been more aggressive recently than you had been over say the last several years and sort of pairing back where appropriate but I guess increasingly I am finding myself getting questions about why your branch footprint shouldn't be like 1,000 or so branches, if you are just given how many more branches you have been -- the other biggest players in the country so just curious if you could maybe offer a little color on sort of how you are thinking about the appropriateness of the footprint as look you forward and what any additional opportunities might be?
We transaction billions of dollars, billions of interactions each quarter but over 50 millions time a month somebody still comes into our branches and they want to be able to use them.
Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
Is there any possibility that, that type of product whether it was an interest only product for a 10-year term, would those come back when you think about growing the portfolio since they performed so much better than expected.
Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.
Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
In the third quarter, we earned $0.84 a share; including the impact of a $1 billion discrete litigation accrual for previously disclosed mortgage related regulatory investigations.
As we committed to a year ago we reviewed more accounts over a longer period of time and identified additional customers who may have been impacted.
Cash and short-term investments increased to $7.4 billion, reflecting lower loan balances and growth in deposits.
Starting with commercial loans on Page 7, lien utilization rate remain stable at approximately 40% in the third quarter and balance is increased $3.7 billion from a year ago, but declined $5.7 billion from the second quarter.
We provided $6.5 billion of financing relating to our government guarantee student loan sale in the fourth quarter of 2014 which is then securitized in several tranches over the past couple of years with $1.3 billion remaining at the end of the third quarter down approximately $800 million from the second quarter.
We fully anticipated the run down of a couple of loan portfolios we acquired from GE Capital and pay downs have totaled $7.9 billion over the past 18 months including $1.7 billion in the third quarter with approximately half of the reduction in the quarter in C&I and half in commercial real estate.
However, consumer loans increased $200 million from the second quarter with growth in first mortgage loans and credit card.
Our first mortgage loans increased $3.6 billion from the second quarter, reflecting $7.5 billion of growth in non-conforming mortgage loans, partially offset by the continued run-off of higher yielding legacy portfolios.
In terms of credit card portfolio, over the past three years our annual growth rate was the largest among the large banks.
Our auto portfolio continued to decline as expected and was down $2.5 billion from the second quarter as a result of tightening underwriting standards.
Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $252 million from the second quarter driven by declines in personal loans and lines which we expect to continue to decline due to lower branch referrals over the past year.
As highlighted on Page 9, average deposits were $1.3 trillion, up $44.9 billion or 4% from a year-ago and up $5.2 billion from the second quarter.
Net interest income increased $524 million, or 4% from a year-ago primarily driven by growth in earnings assets and higher interest rates.
However, net interest income declined $7 million from the second quarter as the impacts of lower investment portfolio yields driven by accelerated prepayments and lower average loan balances were largely offset by the impact of one additional day in the quarter and a modest benefit from all other growth and repricing.
Non-interest income declined $926 million from a year-ago, driven by lower mortgage banking revenue and was $236 million from the second quarter.
As shown on Page 13, expenses increased $810 million from the second quarter, driven by $1 billion litigation accrual.
The $665 million increase in running the business in non-discretionary expense was driven by higher operating losses reflecting the $1 billion litigation accrual.
It's also important to note that these initiatives do not include the benefit of the expected run-off of core deposit intangibles by 2019 which resulted in $640 million of expenses in the first nine months of the year.
Turning to our business segments starting on Page 18, Community Banking earned $2.2 billion in the third quarter, the impact from $1 billion litigation accrual which is reported in this segment was the primary driver of the year-over-year and linked quarter decline.
While this past year has been challenging, the numbers we've made are creating more consistency -- the changes we've made are creating more consistency and simplicity for our branch team members which will result in a better experience for our customers.
John, I want to try again to ask about the idea of the timing differences between initial $2 billion of expense saves to be realized by the end of next year.
So it's not dollar for dollar if as these things roll off and that first $2 billion gets realized those benefit, but with respect to efficiency ratio we think that will be sort in the -- as I mentioned plus or minus 61% from the fourth quarter and it is definitely our goal to be at 59% or below at some point next year.
My first question is for you Tim. I think that as I speak with your current and prospective shareholders, the biggest sort of question mark in terms of visibility into next year is not really on the expense management side but really on the revenue side.
And again I think wholesale banking performance in the quarter was good and I'd say the same thing for wealth and investment management.
John provided a number of details in his presentation as it relates to some of our consumer businesses but for the rest of the company we are continuing to move forward.
And I am wondering as we think about 4Q, 2019, John, is it a simple as saying okay let's assume a core run rate for Wells Fargo, let's say it's the $13.3 billion this quarter excluding the $1 billion in litigation accrual, assume a growth rate off of that and then deduct $500 million.
We don't know what's going to happen at the longer end but and the big question mark about that is what is the deposit response in retail that bigger banks either cause or impacted by on the next move because we model a reasonably meaningful response and yet we haven't seen what yet so there could be upside to that.
So as we've highlighted for last few quarters, I think it's likely that the auto portfolio will continue to decline over the next few quarters.
Having said all that, the reason we became the largest lender in this country is because we look at the market, we look at our customer demand and we want to make sure we are making good, long-term credit decision.
Oh I think again we called out some specifics for example in this quarter we had a number of larger CRE construction loans that paid off and that's again that's going to be little bit episodic but overall view is that we are going to see growth across the entire portfolio again because we are in so many businesses, each business is going to have a little bit different complexion in the quarter.
And then going forward what you see is a lot less volatility and the reason of course we are adopting it is because we are creating this noise in non-interest income that was bouncing around to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter that was just as a result of different evaluation schemes for the liability lag and the hedge lag and things that were permanently hedged.
So by doing this we think we open up more flexibility for Wells Fargo going forward and as you mentioned the industry got word that there will be instead of an annual cycle, at least this time an extra year and so whether we wait and file at the end of that period or we file at the middle of that period, we haven't really figured out yet but the intention is to move towards SPOE and we thought that the investment community should know that.
And if we think that there is more opportunity from a risk-reward standpoint as it relates to credit and we will take advantage of that but I think the decisions we've made over the last year had really worked because when you look at the average FICO scores of our customers, we did now increase and that's exactly what we wanted.
Even said all that I think you should expect that portfolio -- I am not being negative I just want to make sure you reinforce the comment I made to Ken, you should expect the portfolio even if we turn things up a notch to continue to decline through the fourth quarter this year through most of the next year and probably bottom out again sometime hopefully at the second half of next year.
Don't get us wrong and our expectation is over time we will continue to gain share in that business but right now we are cautious and we got lot of changes going into the business and we got to execute those.
And I'll be quick on this one but the way we should think about with loan growth and the potential impact of the sales practice in card and auto insurance issues that if those issues did not happen at all.
I can't commit to you Matt that we've finished everything because things are still in progress but we are very far along but I think it's also important to reinforce -- our review of all of our policies, procedures, practices is going to continue for a long time meaning that we got to continue to ask more of ourselves everyday.
And if you had to guess I mean how much longer until you can say we've look through everything, this is what we found, we are done and I kind of appreciate that so issues can pop-up at any company at any time but when you kind of put the stake on the ground and say, we've been through everything, it's a big company, lots of businesses, lots of employees and we are moving forward and I kind of 100% guarantee nothing will pop up but like we are essentially on par with everybody else and we are feeling good from here.
And that is really been I think reflective of you wanting to especially with corporate and wealth management customers not giving any other reasons in this period to work anywhere else.
This is about if you are going online, you are Wells Fargo customer, you type in a little bit information like who you are and you want to mortgage and we pre populate your application so that you are not -- we are not asking you and you are not having to give for the 44 time where you live, how much you make and it's using the trusted data that we have here.
The larger originators we would be one and our other bank competitors or the other have just said you know what we are not going to sign up for the fact that 10 years from now somebody could come back and say I mortgage the originated today defaulted at that point in time.
And then just lastly, you guys talked about your expense initiative, of course, and it's $4 billion that you're going to reduce, I think you, John, pretty clear, that the expectations for the reduction in expenses do not include the core deposit premiums that you've been running every year, also the FDIC special assessment and then also expenses associated with businesses that you sold of.
And when you think about what -- how that sales practices settlement and related reputational impact affected our team and our customers particularly in the third and the fourth quarter, and then Mary and team have been making fundamental changes to the business in terms of a new incentive plan, going through reducing a layer of management in terms of new training and just there has been so much going on.
What we are seeing right now in our branches our team members that are so much more confident and working so much better with their customers to provide them with solutions and I think you are going to see that in not only continued improvement in customer experience and loyalty scores but you are going to see that in terms of growth.

wellsfargo,q4,2017,"We believe that using data and technology to help our customers better manage their finances will enable us to grow and build more long-term relationships.
In 2018, we expect additional innovations including instant issuance of debit cards to customers in mobile wallets and control tower, a central hub for customers to view and manage the places where their Wells Fargo cards and account information is stored.
In addition to these innovations, we rely on our team members to help drive an exceptional customer experience and in 2017 we took a number of steps to enhance team member benefits, including adding four additional paid holidays, announcing plans to grant restricted stock rights to approximately 250,000 team members, and increasing the minimum base pay for all U.S. based team members.
While it's too early to determine the full impact, it appears that tax reform will benefit our customers and help grow the U.S. economy and surveys indicate business confidence has increased.
Our efforts to transform Wells Fargo were evident in our results in 2017, including record deposit balances, improved retail banking household retention, increased brand satisfaction with most recent visit scores, which are now back to the levels we had prior to the sales practice settlements, growth in debit card and credit card purchase volume, both up 6% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, record levels of client assets in wealth and investment management, historically low credit losses, exceptionally strong capital and liquidity levels.
Our results also include an $848 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services which benefited EPS by $0.11, and we had a $3.25 billion litigation accrual in the quarter for a variety of matters including mortgage related regulatory investigations, sales practices and other consumer related matters.
If the tax act drives stronger, industry loan growth this year, deposit betas could be impacted somewhat as market demand for deposits increases to fund this growth.
Our full year 2017 net interest income increased 4% consisting with the expectation we provided at Investor Day. Similarly, our NIM was down 2 basis points to 284 as the negative impacts from the adjustment related to leverage leases and growth in average deposits was partially offset by lower average long-term debt and a modest benefit from all other growth repricing and variable terms.
However, it's important to note, that during the extended period of loan interest rates since these swaps we're entered into they generated incremental revenue of approximately $3 billion for Wells Fargo.
Servicing income declined $47 million, primarily from lower net hedge results due to the impact of changes in MSR valuation assumptions, including the impact of increasingly competitive industry pricing, lower carry on our MSR hedge in the flatter yield curve environment and increased customer payment deferrals in areas impacted by recent hurricanes.
The $142 million increase from the third quarter in compensation and benefits expense reflected higher stock award expense, primarily from stock price and performance impacts on prior period awards.
As a reminder the first $2 billion of targeted expense saves by year end 2018 supports our ongoing investment in the businesses which includes a number of key areas such as enhancing our compliance and risk management capability, building a better bank and strengthening our core infrastructure.
I believe the transformational changes weÂre making to better meet our customers financial needs including providing bankers with innovative tools to enable more meaningful financial conversations with our customers not only improves customer service, but will also drive growth.
We're on track to achieve our expense targets and the transformational changes we're making throughout Wells Fargo will help us achieve our six goals and drive our long-term success.

Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
WeÂre not -- we donÂt really normalize our 2017 expenses and I think many people would obviously look to take out their larger operating losses that we experienced.
I would say that we donÂt think that we have to do too much, although again if thereÂs a big cyclical change that causes betas to catch up to where people might have previously imagined they should be, looking at prior cycles of rate increases, then if weÂre looking for a catalyst or imagining one that could cause that, one of the things that could cause it is a big pick up in loan demand, it hasnÂt been there.
But the industry overall has -- should be thinking about whether an increase in loan demand overall changes the calculus for deposit pricing.
Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.
Thank you very much for those comments on CNBC this morning, my mother thinks -- youÂre now her favorite analyst.
Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.
Our next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
I don't think our view particularly as it relates to retail consumer customers has really changed.
But itÂs really some purpose to do more business of various types with those customers by having that deposit relationship.
Our final question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Can you share with us what kind of penetration you have whether itÂs credit cards or other types of consumer loan products that youÂre actually opening up through the online channel versus people having to come into a branch?
Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions.
Our results in the fourth quarter were strong and they included a net benefit from the tax cuts and Job Act. Other items that impacted our results in the fourth quarter included, the gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, and higher litigation accruals.
On page 6, we provide more details on the impacts of the Tax Act. The estimated tax benefit from the reduction to net deferred income taxes was $3.89 billion, was somewhat unique in that the tax effective, our temporary difference results in a net deferred tax liability which is primarily driven by differences between the book and tax treatment of our leasing and mortgage servicing businesses and mark-to-market timing differences.
Our net interest income for full year 2018 will be dependent on a variety of factors including the level and of slope of the yield curve as well as deposit betas and earning asset growth trends.
This increase included the benefit of the $848 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, which was partially offset by a $414 million reduction from impairments on low income housing and renewable energy investments resulting from the tax act.
Deposit service charges declined $30 million from the third quarter, driven by customer friendly changes including the launch of Overdraft Rewind in November which Tim highlighted at the start of the call.
On page 15, we provide details on our trading related revenue, which declined $49 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by declines in customer trading activity from lower volatility and compressed spreads.
2018 revenue which will impact the efficiency ratio will be influenced by a number of factors including the absolute level of rates, the shape of the yield curve, loan growth, deposit betas, credit spreads, cash redeployment and the absolute level of the equity markets.
We will provide guidance on the expenses for 2019 in our Investor Day in May. For the past couple of years, weÂve been taking a hard look at all of our businesses and their contributions and as a result weÂve had multiple divestitures, we thought it will be helpful to share the revenue and direct expense associated with the businesses we sold over the past two years, which we provide on page 22.
As a reminder, Wells Fargo Insurance Services was sold at the end of November and the share owner services is expected to close later in the first quarter.
On page 24, we highlight the customers continue to actively used their accounts, we have strong growth and digital secure sessions up 8% from a year ago and we continue to have declines in branch and ATM interactions reflecting the increased use of digital channels by our customers.
On page 25, we highlight balance and activity growth which included an increase of 6% in both credit and debit card purchase volume from a year ago.
Wholesale banking results in the fourth quarter included the gain on the sale of our insurance services business.
Our credit quality remained exceptionally strong, our loss rate for the full year was among the lowest in our history and in the fourth quarter our loss rate was 31 basis points of average loans.
And if you think about your new guidance for dollar expenses in 2018 and again fully acknowledging that you will get more color in May, is it fair to take that $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion range, assume a growth rate, and this is for 2020, assuming normal growth rate over the next two years and then take out the $2 billion in cost savings, the $769 million in CDI expense and the $573 million in sold business expense, isn't included?
First, I think it's absolutely fair and the feedback that we've been getting from our customers is that we should all be cautiously optimistic on the impact of the tax reform act on consumers.
And then likewise as John mentioned at it relates to auto, we believe that with all the changes that are going on in the auto portfolio, notwithstanding the underlying credit improvement and new originations, that we will see a continued decline in that portfolio throughout 2018 and in our current estimates this maybe, the lines will start to cross the fourth quarter this year may be first quarter 2019, itÂs -- we will find out.
And my answer continues to be very consistent and that is I think weÂve made a lot of progress in terms of looking at the operations of the company.
But I just canÂt provide you with that absolute guarantee at this moment in time, maybe someday I will, but I think itÂs going to be something we look at the rare view mirror over a longer period of time as opposed to having some inflection point today or tomorrow or the week after that.
Again, weÂve made a lot of progress, but as I reflect on my first year and a quarter in this role, I think itÂs fair to say that one of the mistakes that weÂve made at this company was that we didnÂt have a thorough enough review of the businesses on an ongoing basis.
I think John mentioned in the fourth quarter that he thought we'd see 4% to 5% type revenue growth this year.
A large part of the increase in the fourth quarter to your point was related to higher underlying values, but again that tends to drive revenues in future too.
But we continue to be optimistic about that business and to reinforce John's point about the improvement in referrals from community banking to wealth and investment management.
Quick question on the loan growth, it looks like CRE was loan growth again this quarter and you did mention that you saw focusing on continued credit discipline.
But I am pleased with the progress and our expectation for 2018 as we are going to see checking account growth, I would also say -- primary checking account growth, I would also say an improvement over what you saw in the fourth quarter but I would also say that underlying value of those accounts has increased, and weÂve talked about that at Investor Day last year.
The C&I loans, credit card and first mortgage is likely where our net loan growth is going to come from in 2018 and similar to the quarter.
But as it relates to capital return, I think that I said it early in the call and John repeated it that weÂre pleased to have increased the amount of capital returned to our shareholders by 16% year-over-year and our expectation is that we will continue to increase capital return because we have excess capital at the company to fund our growth.
No, thatÂs right the I guess I was interpreting the question also mean deployment for growth and loan portfolio and that would be the first call on our capital share and make loans for our customers.
WeÂve got a lot of liquidity where we are not in a position where we think we need to attract a lot of incremental deposits to fund the next $10 billion of loans.
And we look at the pace of innovation particularly for us, I think thatÂs been one of the drivers and some of the reasons why weÂve been able to continue to attract deposits.
But, at this point may be at Investor Day it will be easier to think about the year as a whole because we will have a quarter and some change behind us.
But, I wouldnÂt pencil in last yearÂs growth rate this year until we get a little bit further into and we know what tax reform means and a couple of other things.
My general guess is that within the relevant range for likely loan growth for Wells Fargo, that if we achieve the higher end of that range, and the impact on our deposit price isn't really going to be because we think that we need to go out and raise more money and jack up our deposit cost, but rather that it's happening to others and they're doing it and we respond -- and if we feel we need to we will be responding to what's happening in the market.
I think when you move from traditional retail deposit customers to wealth customers, itÂs more competitive and youÂve seen the higher weighted there and weÂre kind of in the middle, and thatÂs fine with us.
I think that when we look at our branch network, we included a number of factors beyond just a P&L for the branch as a likely expectation for growth or quality of customers.

wellsfargo,q1,2018,"Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss preliminary results and answer your questions.
These actions are designed to help our customers succeed financially and to build long-term relationships, and we have made changes to compensation and processes in our branches which are also improving customer service, and in the first quarter customer loyalty survey scores reached their highest levels since August of 2016.
We closed 58 branches in the first quarter and we are on track to close approximately 300 branches this year, which is an increase [indiscernible] 250 branches we announced at our last Investor Day. As we highlighted last quarter, we currently expect our total branch network to decline to approximately 5,000 by the end of 2020.
Our revenue included a $643 million gain from sales of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans; $250 million in mark-to-market unrealized equity gains due to the new financial instruments accounting standard, which I'll discuss a little later on the call; a $202 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services; and $176 million reduction from a LOCOM adjustment relating to $1.9 billion of loans transferred to held-for-sale.
We are focused on compliance with the Consent Order's asset cap and maintaining liquidity and other financial risk management targets, while minimizing the impact to our customers, minimizing adverse long-term strategic effects, and maintaining our financial risk discipline.
Our balance sheet declined $36.4 billion from year-end, primarily due to a $32 billion decline in commercial deposits from financial institutions, including approximately $15 billion of actions taken to comply with the Consent Order asset cap.
We'd expect the earnings impact to increase in subsequent quarters but we continue to estimate that the net income after tax impact will be $300 million to $400 million for the full year of 2018.
I'm going to highlight much of what's on Page 4 later on the call, so let me just point out that the decline in deposits drove the $20 billion reduction in cash and short-term investments in the first quarter, and the decline in stockholders' equity was driven by a $2.8 billion decline in [OCI] [ph], resulting primarily from higher rates.
I will be highlighting our income statement drivers on Page 5 throughout the call, so let me just mention that we adopted new accounting standards in the first quarter, which we summarized on Page 17 and 18 of the earnings release.
The decline in loan balances were not related to any actions we took in connection with the Consent Order but was driven by opportunistic or strategic loan sales, seasonality, and continued declines in certain portfolios that we've been reducing for some time including auto, Pick-a-Pay mortgage, and junior lien mortgage loans.
I'll summarize the specific drivers of period-end loan declines starting on Page 7, but let me first point out that the average loan yields increased to 4.5% in the first quarter, the highest yield since the fourth quarter of 2012.
Auto loans were down $3.8 billion from the fourth quarter and included the transfer of $1.6 billion of loans to held-for-sale as a result of the pending sale of certain assets of Reliable Financial Services, a Puerto Rican subsidiary of our auto business.
With the completion of the centralization of our collection and funding activities, which Tim highlighted earlier, we're now positioned to start to increase originations over time and currently expect the portfolio of balances to begin growing in early 2019.
Our average deposit cost increased 6 basis points from the fourth quarter and was up 17 basis points from a year ago, versus the 75 basis point change in the Fed fund's rate.
Since the increase in interest rates began at the end of 2015, [indiscernible] price-sensitive commercial deposits have been relatively consistent with the prior interest rate cycles, and we expect this trend to continue.
The drivers of this reduction included an approximately $160 million decline from two fewer days in the quarter, $148 million from hedge ineffectiveness accounting, and $144 million in lower swap-related income related to the receive-fixed loan swap position that we finished unwinding early in the first quarter.
I also wanted to update that impacts from the tax act reduced our NIM by 4 basis points in both the fourth quarter from a one-time adjustment related to leverage leases and in the first quarter primarily from a decline in tax equivalent yield on municipal bonds.
Starting with deposit service charges, the $73 million decline from fourth quarter was driven largely by the impact of customer-friendly initiatives, including the first full quarter impact of Overdraft Rewind.
Given current market pricing trends, we would expect our production margin to continue to decline into the second quarter.
Turning to expenses on Page 12, expenses declined $2.6 billion from the fourth quarter, largely driven by $2.9 billion of lower operating losses.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $714 million in the first quarter, and similar to Wholesale Banking, the lower tax rate drove the growth in [net income] [ph].
Turning to Page 22, our credit performance remained strong in the first quarter and our loss rate was 32 basis points of average loans.
As you may recall, in the third quarter of last year we increased reserve coverage by $450 million for potential hurricane related losses based on an initial review of our portfolio.
In summary, our preliminary results in the first quarter continued to reflect strong asset quality, liquidity and capital, and we remain on track to achieve our target of $4 billion in expense saves by the end of 2019.
I wanted to ask you guys to talk a little bit more about the outlook for net interest income, and specifically, there are a lot of moving parts here with the asset cap impact, you mentioned it's supposed to increase from here, but then there is the benefits to come from the swap roll-off over time and the NII sensitivity improving, so can you help us just understand like do you have an expectation you can grow NII and what will drive that, will it be rate more than volume at this point?
At the longer end of the curve, we are continually reinvesting what's coming through in amortization and prepayments from a mortgage securities portfolio, and if long rates remain in the call it sub 2.80 range, then that won't be much of a driver.
One important point that I'd make that I don't think is really well appreciated is that a lot of what's been happening on the asset side of our books as we've run down some higher yielding assets on purpose is that there's an increase in overall credit quality that's coming with a lower spread component.
And so, I guess if I were modelling it, I would bleed it in, but we still think 300 to 400 of [indiscernible] is the right number and it was negligible in the first quarter because of just the seasonal roll-down in the size of the balance sheet, and so it's more of the second half of the year realization.
So just another somewhat related for you, Tim, with a lot of negative headlines in recent months, could you discuss how the team members and customers are dealing with the challenges here, specifically kind of how your employee and customer attrition, how has that been going in wealth management and the commercial businesses?
Just wanted to follow up on Ken's question on your net interest income outlook, so as I think about, John, what you mentioned about the 59% efficiency ratio by year-end 2018 being pushed to 2019, does that mean that net interest income will not grow for the rest of the year?
So, as I said to Ken, a variety of things could happen in loan growth, deposit growth, deposit pricing, shape of the curve, Fed moves, et cetera, they are all going to have an impact on where net interest income is.
I mean, Erika, our plans, and John and I have reiterated this on a number of occasions over the last few months, is that we have an excess amount of capital to run and grow Wells Fargo and our plan is to reduce that excess over the next two to three years, and that's where we're going.
And the question, explicit or implicit, as to what that means this year given other things that are going on is one that makes us work that much harder to make sure that we have submitted a very sound plan based on a very sound process, and that's where we think we are.
And John, again, we'll provide a hard dollar number or a range like we did for this year at Investor Day, but assume that that's what you're going to hear.
And then separately, there is what's happening with revenue, which is going to reflect all the things that we just talked about in terms of net interest income and then a range of drivers in noninterest income, more of which we'll talk about in Investor Day. But I sort of think about it as a distribution of potential outcomes based on what's happening with rates and interest income drivers, what's happening in all of our various businesses around noninterest income, and then what we're doing about total expense to deliver it.
No, but I think it seems like the legacy related costs could be elevated this year, the Consent Order is going to be a drag to earnings into next year.
So, that was another one of the things that contributed to the margin not reflecting the benefit of the increase at the short end of curve, and that is a result mostly of a big move up in long rates during the quarter, which gave rise to that accounting outcome.
Our sort of ambient run rate of operating losses for fraud and bank robberies and things like that is $150 million a quarter.
I guess a broader question, John, you mentioned your stock will take care of itself if you can continue to do 15% ROTCEs and 12% [indiscernible] 120 basis points ROAs, and I suspect we will hear more about this at your Investor Day, but this quarter also did have a lot of noise in it, maybe net-net been more positive than negative, but when we compare you to your peers, you are no longer sort of at the top of your peer group in number of performance metrics, and I guess the question is, how important is it to be in the top of your peer group and is it still something that is feasible and is it still something that is important or do you really need to get past your issues, all the issues that have risen that becomes a primary goal or should be a primary goal of the Company?
But as a result, [indiscernible] are happy with their relationship with Wells Fargo, we end up with a large and low-cost deposit base.
I thought the questions were very good and we are going to continue to listen to all the advice that you provide to us, and for our team members that are mentioning today, I want to thank you for all of your hard work and effort as you continue to transform Wells Fargo.
Good morning and thank you for joining us today.
These preliminary results are subject to change due to our ongoing discussions that we are having with the CFPB and OCC to resolve matters regarding our compliance risk management program and our past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions, which the CFPB and the OCC have collectively offered to resolve for an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties.
Our results also included a $550 million reserve release, driven by a significantly improved outlook on hurricane related losses.
We have also maintained our credit risk discipline for new originations in commercial real estate during a period of high liquidity and increased competition, resulting in four consecutive quarters of lower balances.
Commercial loans were relatively flat compared with fourth quarter, with C&I loans up $1.6 billion offset by continued declines in commercial real estate due to continued credit discipline in a competitive highly liquid financing market as well as ongoing paydowns on existing and acquired loans.
Consumer loans declined $9.5 billion [indiscernible] fourth quarter.
Average consumer and small business banking deposits declined $2.1 billion as higher community bank deposits were more than offset by lower deposits in Wealth and Investment Management, reflecting movement into other investments.
The $2.6 billion decline in running the business non-discretionary [indiscernible] category reflected lower operating losses.
Our total FTE were down 3% from a year ago and also reflected lower FTE in Community Banking and consumer lending.
On Page 15 we highlight the expected full-year 2018 total expense range, which has not changed since we provided it last quarter.
We will provide a dollar range for 2019 expenses at our Investor Day in May. The expected decline in revenue from the balance sheet actions needed to comply with the Consent Order's asset cap will likely result in our efficiency ratio remaining above 59% throughout this year.
The release this quarter also reflected continued improvement in residential real estate and lower loan balances.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
But I guess what I'm getting at is the 55% to 59% range that you had provided previously and before some of these issues, how long do you think it takes you to get towards that midpoint again, barring new issues on the regulatory front coming up?
Okay, thanks Tim. John R.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
This quarter we actually saw a nice pop in [indiscernible] plus no loss, a little bit [indiscernible] impact also a little bit and they count, but is this the first time that we're going to see those asset yields move up enough to offset and even pace faster than deposit rates and maybe start to see margin expansion from here?
Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Just wanted to see if that cleans that issue up or is there still more reserve release that could happen based on loan performance from the hurricane side?
So, on the hurricane side, just for everyone's benefit, at the end of the third quarter, right after the hurricanes impacted Texas and Louisiana and then Puerto Rico had hit, we granted 90 day payment holidays to our consumer customers in those geographies so they could focus on getting their live together and not worrying about making a payment on their loans and becoming or become [indiscernible].
Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.
Our final question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

wellsfargo,q2,2018,"At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.
Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions.
In the second quarter, we introduced iPrint biometric log-on capabilities for our commercial customers, making it easier for them to do business.
Our ability to significantly increase our returns demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model, our sound financial risk management practices and our strong capital position, which is a result of the capital we built in recent years through continued stable earnings and a lower level of risk-weighted assets.
And while our effective income tax rate increased to 25.9% in the second quarter from this expense, we currently expect our effective income tax rate for the remainder of '18 to be approximately 19%, excluding the impact of any other future discrete items.
As we're highlighting on Page 3, operating losses in the second quarter were driven by a customer remediation for previously disclosed matters, all of which have been referenced in our recent 10-Q and 10-Q filings.
In the second quarter, we accrued $114 million to refund customers that may have been overcharged at any time during the past seven years.
During the second quarter, we also accrued additional amounts for remediation related to past practices in our automobile lending business, including insurance-related products, and related to mortgage interest rate lock extensions.
The decline in the balance sheet in the second quarter primary reflected lower deposits, driven by seasonality as well as commercial and Wealth and Investment Management customers allocating more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments.
First mortgage loans increased $343 million as high-quality, nonconforming loan origination growth was partially offset by $2.3 billion of lower Pick-a-Pay mortgage loans, including the sales of $1.3 billion of PCI loans.
However, junior lien mortgage originations grow in the second quarter, up 15% from a year ago.
There's typically a seasonal decline in deposits in the second quarter, which includes the impact of customer tax payments.
Wholesale Banking deposits declined $23.6 billion in the second quarter.
The decline in these deposits reflected temporary high levels of liquidity from the commercial payments business at the end of March as well as $3.9 million in actions taken in response to the asset cap.
Consumer and small business banking deposits declined $20.2 billion from the first quarter, driven by seasonality as well as customers allocating more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments.
Our NIM increased nine basis points to 2.93%, driven by a reduction in the proportion of lower-yielding assets, a less negative impact from hedge ineffectiveness accounting, and the net benefit of rate -- interest rate and spread movements.
Noninterest income declined $752 million from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage revenue and a reduction of $210 million from businesses we sold during the past year, which also reduced expenses.
It's also important to note that 46% of deposit service charges in the second quarter are from wholesale customers and are related to the Treasury Management fees they pay for services we provide to them.
The increase in expenses was also driven by $269 million in higher operating losses, primarily related to the customer remediation from previously disclosed matters that I highlighted earlier.
Community Banking earnings increased $583 million from the first quarter, driven by lower operating losses, partially offset by higher income taxes from the net discrete income tax expense in the second quarter.
Wholesale Banking earnings declined $240 million from the first quarter, which included a $202 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services.
Results in the second quarter included $171 million in operating losses related to the foreign exchange business, as I mentioned earlier.
Wealth and Investment Management earnings declined $269 million from the first quarter, driven by the impairment from the announced sale of our ownership stake in RockCreek and $114 million of operating losses related to fee calculations in certain fiduciary and custody accounts, as I also mentioned earlier.
Our credit card -- our strong credit results continued with our loss rate in the second quarter declining to 26 basis points of average loans, a historically low level.
In summary, our second quarter results continued to reflect strong credit quality, liquidity and capital.
John, I was wondering, in terms of the net interest income, is the $12.5 billion that you did this quarter, is that a fair jumping-off point for us to think about going forward?
And I think the biggest puts and takes are going to be what happens with both deposit and loan growth coming from separate drivers; what happens with, in particular, retail deposit betas, which as I pointed out have been outperforming our -- or the industry-modeled expectations and past performance; and then maybe, although not immediately, what happens at the long end of the curve as we continue to redeploy excess liquidity in our bond portfolio.
And in terms of excess liquidity, do you feel like you have a fair amount now relative to what you need for regulatory purposes, and it's just a question of the pricing and rates available that dictates how much you put to work?
And so we're going to continue to manage capital in an appropriate way, thinking on a multiyear period.
We were pleased to see, as John mentioned, originations in home equity pick up on a sequential-quarter basis and year-over-year, which was good.
Where the lines cross, as John mentioned earlier in terms of growing the overall portfolio, it's likely to happen in the -- sometime in the first half of next year, not 100% certain when.
On the origination side, I think we're going to continue to kind of be the Wells Fargo that's been around for decades, and that is that we're going to underwrite in an appropriate way.
I think historically when you look at periods of overcapacity in the mortgage business, the rationalization doesn't naturally clearly occur in the second and the third quarter because those are the quarters where you see the most originations.
I think the real benefit from our model, unlike maybe a monoline mortgage-only originator, is we've got the balance sheet product.
Going back to what you said to Betsy, Tim, about hopefully more earnings, I just wanted to ask about how we should think about the fee outlook ex mortgage.
That's a big impact that in terms of the math that you just described, I think our expectation is that trust and investment fees will continue to grow.
And for your peers of a similar size because you have larger investment banking and trading businesses, often investors expect a more sensitive flex to the expense base in terms of the relationship to fees.
I think kind of the middle-market demand is -- and we saw growth in our middle-market banking business, so that continues to be good.
But in terms of the -- our overall expenses for '19, this $52 billion to $53 billion that we're guiding to is a way to think about what that means in connection with run rate expenses, investment expenses, everything else that's going on.
Having said that, I think maybe because of our business model, the initial calculated impact to us is probably at the lower end of that range, especially for the larger banks.
We've talked about the competition for loans and the fact that we've got some portfolios running down on purpose, some where we've tapped the brakes like commercial real estate and auto, although we're probably more open for business in auto than we have been over the last several quarters.
John is going to provide more details on this income tax expense as well as other noteworthy items that impacted our results later in the call.
Our small business banking deposit customers can now apply and, if approved, immediately accept card payments and purchase processing equipment through one convenient online application at Wells Fargo Merchant Services.
And the millions of hours our team members volunteer each year contributed to Wells Fargo recently being named as one of the 50 most community-minded companies in the U.S. from the Points of Light organization.
These efforts are reflected in continued declines in voluntary team member attrition, which -- with second quarter voluntary attrition at its lowest level in over five years.
Our earnings of $5.2 billion included $481 million net discrete income tax expense.
Our results also included $619 million of operating losses primarily related to non-litigation expense for previously disclosed matters, which I'll highlight in more detail in the next page.
We had a $479 million gain on the sale of $1.3 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans; $214 million of other-than-temporary impairment on the announced sale of Wells Fargo's Asset Management 65% ownership stake in The Rock Creek Group; and $150 million reserve release reflecting strong overall portfolio credit performance and lower balances.
In addition, as part of our efforts to make things right and rebuild trust, we've examined rates historically charged to FX customers over a seven-year period and set aside $140 million in the second quarter to rebate customers where historic pricing, while consistent with contracts entered into with those customers, doesn't conform to our recently implemented standards and pricing.
However, the asset cap related to the Federal Reserve's consent order has not impacted our ability to grow our core lending and deposit taking businesses.
The decline in loan balances was not related to any actions we took in connection with the consent order, but was driven by opportunistic loan sales and continued reductions in auto, consumer real estate and commercial real estate.
Commercial loans declined $291 million from the first quarter, despite C&I loans increasing $1.9 billion on growth in our Asset Backed Finance, Middle Market Banking and commercial capital business.
The growth was more than offset by continued declines in Commercial Real Estate, primarily due to lower originations reflecting continued credit discipline and competitive highly liquid financing markets as well as ongoing paydowns on existing and acquired loans.
Balances in student lending and personal loans and lines continued to decline, but originations of personal loans and lines were up 8% from a year ago and reached their highest level since the third quarter of 2016.
Average consumer and small business banking deposits declined $1.4 billion as higher average Community Banking deposits were more than offset by lower deposits in Wealth and Investment Management as customers allocated more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments.
Our average deposit cost increased six basis points from the first quarter and was up 19 basis points from a year ago compared with a 75 basis point change in the Fed funds rate.
The increase in our average deposit cost was driven by increases in commercial and Wealth and Investment Management deposit rates, while rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits have not yet meaningfully responded to rate movements.
Wholesale Banking deposits also declined due to seasonality and commercial customers allocating more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments.
The drivers of the increase included $120 million less negative impact from hedge ineffectiveness accounting; approximately $105 million from balance sheet mix, repricing and variable income, largely driven by the net impact of rates and spreads; and approximately $80 million from one additional day in the quarter.
While deposit service charges had minimal impact to linked-quarter trends, they were down 9% from a year ago, so I want to provide more insight into these fees.
I've highlighted in prior quarters the customer-friendly initiatives we've launched over the past year to help our consumer customers reduce fees, including Overdraft Rewind, which is an industry-leading feature that's helped over 1.3 million customers avoid overdraft charges.
As market interest rates have risen over the past year, the earnings credit rate on noninterest-bearing deposits has modestly reduced these fees for wholesale customers, which were down $25 million from a year ago.
Residential mortgage originations increased $7 billion from the first quarter, but revenue declined $102 million due to a lower production margin.
The production margin declined to 77 basis points as a result of increased pricing competition in both retail and correspondent channels.
Card fees increased $93 million from the first quarter on higher credit and debit card purchase volume.
Other fees increased $46 million and included higher Commercial Real Estate brokerage commissions.
Revenue-related expenses increased $59 million primarily from incentive compensation in Wells Fargo Securities and in home lending.
Compensation and benefits expense increased $265 million, primarily due to salary increases and higher severance, partially offset by the impact of the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, which drove FTE reductions in Wholesale Banking.
Both customer loyalty and overall satisfaction with most recent visit survey scores declined in the second quarter, which was driven by several factors, including recent events and a risk-based policy change affecting individuals making cash deposits into an account on which they're not a signer.
We had a $150 million reserve release, reflecting strong credit performance and lower loan balances.
Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
I will say that the -- where we are in the aggregate for fee income is part of what's driving us to get overall fixed expenses as low as they can possibly be, so a little bit different than Erika's question about revenue-related expense on the fee side.
But if fee income continues to be under pressure and not growing at an acceptable rate, we're going to go even deeper in core expenses.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.
Yes. I think the key for us is to make sure that we've got the right transition place -- in place, which Jon Weiss and David Kowach are very focused on, make sure that we've got -- we're continuing to develop the new FAs in the salary and bonus kind of business model structure and then making sure that we're continuing to invest on the digital side, Intuitive Investor is an example, so that the new demographic of investors has got additional options in addition to a real high-quality traditional FA model.
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
Yes. I don't think every dollar of a money market mutual fund would have stayed inside Wells Fargo.

wellsfargo,q3,2018,"Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions.
IÂm confident that these changes are building a better Wells Fargo for all of our stakeholders and we are encouraged by the positive business trends we had in the third quarter, including year-over-year growth in primary consumer checking customers, debit and credit card usage, loan originations in auto, small business, home equity and personal loans and lines.
We continued to have strong credit quality and high levels of liquidity and capital and we doubled our capital return compared with the third quarter last year, including a 10% increase in our common stock dividend.
Auto loans were down $1.6 billion from the second quarter due to expected continued run off and the transfer of the remaining $374 million of reliable financial services auto loans to held-for-sale.
Average deposits declined $40 billion from a year ago, reflecting lower wholesale banking deposits, including the actions taken in the first half of the year to manage to the asset gap as well as lower wealth and investment management deposits as customers allocated more cash to higher rate alternatives.
Wholesale banking deposits increased $9.1 billion in the third quarter with most of the growth coming later in the quarter after we made targeted adjustments to our pricing in a competitive rate environment.
Non-interest income increased $357 million from the second quarter with growth in other income, market sensitive revenue, mortgage banking, service charges on deposits and card fees.
Deposit service charges were up $41 million from the second quarter, primarily driven by seasonality and partially offset by a higher earnings credit rate for our commercial customers.
Mortgage banking revenue increased $76 million from the second quarter from higher net gains on residential and commercial mortgage loan originations.
We had declines in most of our expense categories on a linked quarter basis, including compensation and benefits, revenue related, running the business both discretionary and non-discretionary and third-party services.
Our positive business trends in the third quarter included growth in primary consumer checking customers, increased debit and credit card usage and higher loan originations in auto, small business, home equity and personal loans and lines which are all up from a year ago and we generated positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis.
We donÂt have a single solid number for 2020 in revenue for all the reasons that you can imagine in terms of where rates go, where industry loan growth, deposit growth and a variety of other things happen.
Some of them as we have talked about are on different cycles than others like mortgage, for example, where if that market is shrinking and if the industry gain on sale is as it is today, then the outcomes in the future will reflect the size of the market, our position in the market and what profitability looks like overall.
And now, you have seen that for two consecutive quarters and we reiterated that we think by the middle of next year, we will see growth in the overall portfolio.
I think the exciting thing about the auto business is not only are we seeing quarter, year-over-year and sequential quarter growth in loans, but we are doing it more efficiently, because about 40% of all the loans that we are originating are being originated on an automated basis in terms of credit decisioning as opposed to a manual basis.
As we think about the $50 billion to $51 billion for 2020 outside of the headcount trajectory that you have announced, is the 2020 target a result of something incremental that you had unearthed in terms of an expense opportunity or is it really just a continuation of the process improvement that you started a few years ago?
And I am going to ask this question another way, if revenues happen to be better than expected and the market is wrong about banks or at the top end of the range, is that $50 billion to $51 billion a firm dollar number to expect?
I mean, we have a really strong asset-backed finance business and we have seen good growth in that business for some of the reasons that you allude to which is that we have seen non-bank competition in a variety of forms continue to increase.
ItÂs in a little bit different form right now, because of some of the legacy non-bank competitors have gone away, gone out of business whatever, but the fundamental underwriting in that group is relatively short duration.
I think we have talked about this at the last conference that I spoke at, there is a distribution of consumer and commercial asset types, interesting most of which where we are deeply in the underlying business although sometimes these non-banks as where you started your question are competing in a way that we wouldnÂt directly.
ItÂs also a business that we can pursue on a pooled basis with a haircut after the fact, but you have got all manner of sovereign wealth funds and alternative asset managers and others who are aggressive in an unregulated way and doing things on a whole loan basis that a bank wonÂt do.
So, I think the fact that we have got very buoyant capital markets, very liquid capital markets and we have high credit quality for our customers means that loan growth is a little bit slower than we would have all imagined in an economic growth level that we are seeing right now.
ThatÂs how I think, I mean and by a little bit, itÂs close enough that plus or minus flat.
So, second question just on the mix of the balance sheet, we see that obviously with rising rates, your OCI is going up a little bit and this is a balance that I think you have talked about for a while now, John.
And I think we have been, while this backup is happening and not knowing exactly where itÂs going to end, I think we have been a little bit circumspect about incrementally moving from 2 and change percent on cash further out the curve.
John the only other point I would make in just Â and I know you know this, but I think any time we talk about loan growth is important to re-emphasize it.
So, there has been some impact from some of the reputation issues that we had, but I think the important thing is that you see in the overall numbers and performance this quarter, the improvement and us getting beyond some of those reputational issues.
Each quarter is going to have a story to it, but I think the important thing is that when you look Â if you look across the income statement, you are seeing more of our business, more of our products gross on a sequential quarter basis and year-over-year.
As John described, I think we are in a new world as it relates to home equity loans, but the fact that we saw growth across the consumer portfolio was actually good.
I donÂt think so, I mean itÂs impact at the end of the quarter we will be calling out at that time, I tend to discount that because itÂs uneconomic, itÂs really just a Â itÂs an accounting outcome thatÂs back to zero over the life of the hedge instruments and the hedge itself from the Â real fundamental of the business, the cash flow that we are generating I think deposit pricing is probably the biggest variable in the quarter.
And if you look at that line normalizing for non-core items, itÂs been kind of flat to down in recent quarters, can you just give us a sense of again whatÂs sort of in that number and how we should think about it on an ongoing basis and what a more normalized level or how we should think about modeling it would be?
The deeper we get into the markets that we are in, so the tighter credit spreads get, we have already seen rates move backup, it gets harder to generate those types of gains I would say, whether itÂs pre-crisis things that have been on the balance sheet for 10 years that were marked a certain way or appreciated investments that we have made over the last 10 years.
Good morning, can you guys share with us you talked John, a bit about raising some deposit rates in the wholesale business enables you to grow that deposits at the end of the quarter, can you share with us what that might do for the fourth quarter in terms of deposit growth in that area and also the net interest margin?
And then coming to the asset side of the balance sheet, when you talk about your commercial and industrial loan portfolio, I think in the second quarter, you indicated that the loans to non-depository financials was about $94.5 billion, what did that grow to in the third quarter?
So, I wouldnÂt want you to Â it is a weighted average, but it hasnÂt changed in at least the last couple of years as I have looked at the quarter to quarter information which incidentally when we think about the demand for credit, I generally expect that customers use available revolving facilities before negotiating and paying for new incremental available credit and we havenÂt seen much of that.
So, Nancy, the way that we think about the mortgage business today is that we have got to be able to improve our results based upon the environment that we are in.
So, I think what you are going to see is a continued improvement in the efficiency of that business, assuming that we are in overall, but particularly in an environment that we are in right now.
Well, itÂs right-sized for today, but our expectation not only for mortgage, but for all of our business and this gets back to JohnÂs comments about how we think about efficiency and expenses is what can we do to improve the returns to the business?
And maybe, particularly, as we become a bigger credit card bank, weÂll be even a little bit more incrementally exposed to that, but that part of the business, thatÂs a growth risk for banks like Wells Fargo.
I know itÂs still a headwind to loan growth overall, but for the pay-downs specifically, was that an acceleration from the previous quarter or did it decelerate and whatÂs your expectations going forward?
But I think we mentioned earlier, new accounts in general purpose credit card, including Propel were up 27% linked quarter and 17% year-over-year which is good momentum.
And thatÂs really, Brian, one of the reasons why we are being somewhat conservative in providing a lot of details because when you think about the business model and returns for that card, you got to see all the additional metrics that John is describing.
In addition, our retail customers continue to benefit from consumer-friendly initiatives we implemented last year, including overdraft rewind which has helped over 1.8 million customers avoid overdraft charges.
While this latest change does not have a material impact on our deposit service charges since the monthly fees were minimal, it does encourage younger customers to join and stay with Wells Fargo.
We also recently launched Control Tower, which provides customers with a single view of their digital financial footprint, including where their Wells Fargo debit or credit card or account information is connected such as with recurring payments.
We are committed to working with organizations and agencies on the ground to help our communities recover and providing continued assistance to our team members and customers, who have been impacted including reversing certain fees and allocating $3 million to our WE Care Fund, which provides grants to team members who faced a catastrophic disaster or financial hardship resulting from an event beyond their control.
We also want to be an industry leader in team member engagement and our efforts to make Wells Fargo a better place to work are reflected in continued low voluntary team member attrition.
We returned a record $8.9 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the third quarter, more than double the amount returned a year ago.
As Tim highlighted, we had positive business momentum including primary consumer checking customers up 1.7% from a year ago, increased debit and credit card usage with debit card purchase volume up 9%, and consumer general purpose credit card purchase volume up 7% from a year ago, and higher loan originations with auto up 10%, small business up 28%, home equity up 16%, and personal loans and lines up 3% from a year ago.
Our earnings were $6 billion included a $638 million gain on the sale of $1.7 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans, $605 million of operating losses primarily related to remediation expense for a variety of matters including an additional $241 million accruals of previously disclosed issues related to automobile collateral and protection insurance, $100 million reserve release reflecting strong credit performance as well as lower loan balances.
And an effective income tax rate of 20.1% which included net discrete income tax expense related to the re-measurement of our initial estimates for the impacts of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act recognized in the fourth quarter.
Revenue growth included the increase in net interest income as higher NIM offset lower earning assets, expenses declined driven by lower operating losses, however we also had lower expenses in a number of other categories including outside professional services, outside data processing and travel and entertainment.
Strong credit performance as well as lower loan balances resulted in lower provision expense and our capital levels remained strong while we increased our share buyback and reduced common shares outstanding by 4%.
The decline in average loan balances was driven by strategic loan sales, continued reductions in commercial real estate reflecting our conservative underwriting, declines in auto as we have transformed that business and run off of legacy junior lean mortgage loans.
Commercial loans declined $1.2 billion from the second quarter despite C&I loans increasing $1.5 billion with growth in corporate and investment banking, commercial capital and commercial real estate credit facilities through REITs and non-depository financial institutions.
The decline in CRE mortgage loans was due to ongoing pay-downs on existing and acquired loans as well as lower originations reflecting continued credit discipline in competitive and highly liquid financing markets.
Junior lean mortgage loans continued to decline as pay downs more than offset new originations which grew 3% from the second quarter and 16% from a year ago.
New accounts grew 27% from the second quarter benefiting from the launch of the new Propel card which exceeded our expectations and higher originations through digital channels which generated 45% of all new credit card accounts.
Auto originations increased 8% from the second quarter and 10% from a year ago with high quality origination growth driven by changes related to the business which makes it easier for customers to do business with us including increased automated underwriting.
The $4.9 billion decline in average deposits from the second quarter was driven by lower consumer and small business banking deposits, which includes wealth and investment management deposits as consumers continue to move excess liquidity to higher rate alternatives.
Our average deposit cost increased 7 basis points from the second quarter and was up 21 basis points from a year ago compared with the 100 basis point change in the Fed Funds rate.
Consumer and small business banking deposits declined $13.7 billion from the second quarter driven by customers in wealth and investment management and community banking moving excess liquidity to higher rate alternatives which was partially offset by modest growth in small business banking deposits.
Trust and investment fees declined $44 million from the second quarter on lower investment banking results and lower retail brokerage transaction activity.
While residential mortgage loan originations declined $4 billion from the second quarter, their production margin increased to 97 basis points primarily due to an improvement in secondary market conditions.
Given our commitment to improving efficiency, the transformational changes we are making across our businesses as well as our changing customer preferences, including adoption of digital self-service capabilities, we recently announced that we expect our headcount to decline by approximately 5% to 10% within the next 3 years as part of achieving our expense targets.
These higher expenses were partially offset by the impact of the sale of Wells Fargo insurance services and lower FTEs as part of our efficiency initiative.
While we have more work to do, our efforts to improve efficiency are already being reflected in areas such as outside professional services, outside data processing, T&E, postage and supplies and we currently expect that we will meet our 2018 expense target.
Turning to our segments starting on Page 17, community banking earnings increased $320 million from the second quarter driven by lower net discrete income tax expense.
Turning to Page 20, wholesale banking earnings increased $216 million from the second quarter reflecting lower operating losses and higher revenue.
Results from the third quarter also reflected lower operating losses.
The reduction in RWA included a one-time impact from our implementation of the newly issued regulatory guidance covering high volatility commercial real estate, which benefited our CET1 ratio by approximately 10 basis points.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler OÂNeill & Partners.
I had another question commercial loan growth across the industry hasnÂt quite matched what we had hoped as we thought about GDP and CapEx expectations.
I think I would also say on home equity, I would be surprised if Â more than surprised if we ever end up with the same percentage of our balance sheet in second lien mortgage paper versus where we were both Wells Fargo alone pre-crisis and then the combination of Wells and Wachovia right after the merger.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Your next question comes from the line of Matt OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.
Yes. We have got some types of wholesale customers who are sitting on lots of excess liquidity and itÂs up to them everyday to think about whether they move it from one bank to another and those deposits incidentally have their own LCR liquidity rating and liquidity value or run off factors that we think about those in a certain way.
Our final question will come from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
",39.23,0.72643197
wellsfargo,q4,2018,"[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations.
Our voluntary team member attrition improved to its lowest level in six years in 2018 and we continued to attract new team members from outside the company including our most recently announced Head of Technology Saul Van Beurden, who will join us and join our operating committee and will report to me in April.
Three, increasing card usage with debit card purchase volume up 8% and consumer general purpose credit card purchase volume up 5% from a year ago; four, growing loan originations year-over-year in auto by 9%, home equity by 14%, small business by 19% and student lending by 16%.
On page six, IÂd like to highlight that our 2013 full year effective income tax rate was 20.2% or 18% before discrete items.
This growth was broad based across a number of our wholesale businesses and was largely to investment grade, corporate credits and high quality middle market borrowers.
Credit card loans increased $1.2 billion from the third quarter driven by seasonality as well as growth in active accounts including the Propel card.
While the change in balance sheet mix negatively impacted net interest income, it also reflected an increasing proportion of higher quality lower risk loans on the balance sheet.
WeÂve made significant changes in how weÂre running many of our consumer and wholesale businesses, including streamlining the retail mortgage sales organization, eliminating layers and reengineering the mortgage fulfillment process, which reduce home lending headcount by 5000 in 2018.
As Tim highlighted at the start of the call, both customer loyalty and overall satisfaction with the most recent visit branch survey scores reached a 24-month high in December with steady improvement over the past six months.
Turning to Page 26, our CET1 ratio fully faced phased-in declined 20 basis points from the third quarter due to common stock dividends and net share repurchases, but it remained well above regulatory minimums and is aligned with our plan of prudently managing toward our internal target of 10%.
While we were pleased to return $25.8 billion to shareholders in 2018 our CET1 ratio was down only 30 basis points from a year ago as RWA improvements, including the regulatory guidance covering high volatility commercial real estate, as well as declines in RWA from changes in balance sheet mix to lower risk assets benefited our capital position.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
Both really good questions Erika, and thanks Erika.
ItÂs just happening a little bit slower than we had originally anticipated, but weÂll get there.
Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.
Going from 11.7 down to 10, are you already kind of mentally at least got an estimate that says okay, we have to reallocate a certain amount from this accounting principle, or how would you think about that between the 170 [ph] points between those two numbers?
Yes actually, thereÂs been a couple of opportunities over the last year as CECLÂs been coming into clearer focus as well as the what the stress capital buffer will mean when itÂs fully implemented.
IÂm not sure if thatÂs 10.25, or 10.375 [ph] or whatever the right number is.
Your next question comes from the line of Matthew OÂConnor with Deutsche Bank.
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
Yes. ItÂs a little tricky, because our bread and butter middle market customer often gets tagged under leveraged lending guidance as the leverage loan even though it doesnÂt exhibit the same either leverage characteristics or structural or governance or other characteristics of a -- of a sponsor owned LBO borrower.
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.
I donÂt think thereÂs that many and certainly not on NVP and not even that many deals on any NEP side where things are getting sold to people who require high yield financing in order to make it work know like another sponsor for example itÂs more often that they're selling something to a strategic whoÂs got their other sources of financing.
We would expect if capacity comes out of the system because smaller players are less efficient players are not making any money then there would be a IÂm not sure if itÂs a return to what gains used to be that people in the industry that seem to believe that thinks you know snap back to some equilibrium level over and over again but this could be different.
Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
I was hoping you can maybe update us on whether that 60 to 70 basis points are still the appropriate through the cycle level youÂre thinking about.
Yes. So if you zeroed out net recovery, you probably end up a few basis points higher than the recent run rate.
Your next question will come from the line up of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions.
We believe that we can achieve both of these priorities, while we operate under the asset cap and our growth in both loans and deposits in the fourth quarter demonstrated our ability to do so.
The settlements weÂve reached last year and the remediation we provided to customers reflects important progress on our goal to move Wells Fargo forward as quickly as possible, while continuing to provide our customers with high quality service, and advice each and every day.
In 2019, we will continue to build the most customer focused, efficient and innovative Wells Fargo ever, characterized by a strong financial foundation, a leading presence in markets we serve, focused growth within a strong risk management framework, operational excellence, and highly engaged team members.
And we had positive business momentum, including one, growing loans in deposits on both an average and period and basis from the third quarter; two, increasing primary consumer checking customers by 1.2% from a year ago net of the previously disclosed sale of 52 branches that closed in the fourth quarter, reducing this growth rate by 0.5%.
Our earnings of $6.1 billion included a $614 million gain on the sale of $.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans, $432 million of operating losses, which included $175 million accrual for the agreement reached in December with all 50 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia regarding previously disclosed consumer matters, a $372 million adjustment, negative net MSR valuation adjustment for servicing and foreclosure costs, discount rates and prepayment estimates recognized as a result of recent market observations related to an acceleration of prepayments, including for VA loans and market participants current valuation of MSRs. These adjustments were not related to our ongoing interest rate hedging, and so hedging program performed as intended to protect against interest rate changes in the fourth quarter.
A $200 million reserve release reflecting continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio, and while it didnÂt impact our earnings, deferred compensation, which is impacted by equity market pricing reduced fees by $452 million and reduced expenses by $428 million in the fourth quarter.
We highlight our full year results on page four, compared with 2017, revenues declined from lower fee income, primarily driven by $1.3 billion decline in mortgage banking, primarily due to lower gains on mortgage originations, a $620 million decline in insurance reflecting the sale of Wells Fargo insurance services, and $395 million decline in deposit service charges driven by the customer friendly changes weÂve implemented, which have reduced fees, together with a higher ECR for commercial customers.
We continued to have strong credit performance due to a number of factors including the efforts to de-risk the loan portfolio by running off or selling higher risk consumer loans while growing higher quality assets.
Average loans increased $6.8 billion from the third quarter, the first linked quarter increase since fourth quarter of 2016 with growth in the commercial portfolio partially offset by continued declines in consumer specifically auto and home equity.
Period end loans increased $10.8 billion from the third quarter, but were down $3.7 billion from a year ago, as we sold or transferred to held for sale $8.4 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans and reliable financial services loans in 2018.
Commercial real estate loans were down $583 million from the third quarter and it declined for seven consecutive quarters, reflecting continued credit discipline and competitive in the highly liquid markets and pay downs of existing and acquired loans.
As we show on page nine, consumer loans declined $709 million from the third quarter and included the sale of $1.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans in the fourth quarter.
Due to the sale of reliable, auto originations were down 1% from the third quarter, but they were up 9% from a year ago, reflecting our focus on growing high quality auto loans following the transformational changes we made to the business.
Average deposits declined $42.7 billion from a year ago reflecting both lower wholesale banking deposits, including actions taken in the first half of the year to manage to the asset gap and lower wealth and investment management deposits as customers allocated more cash to higher rate alternatives.
Wealth and investment management deposits increased for the first time in three quarters, driven by higher retail brokerage sweep deposits, and private banking deposits partially reflecting our customers change in risk appetite given market volatility at the end of the quarter.
Net interest income increased $72 million from the third quarter, driven primarily by the benefits of higher average interest rates and favorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, partially offset by the impacts from balance sheet mix and lower variable income.
Non-interest income declined $1 billion from the third quarter, driven by lower market sensitive revenue, mortgage banking fees, interest and investment fees partially offset by higher other income which included $117 million gain from the sale of 52 branches.
Mortgage banking revenue declined $379 million from the third quarter as a result of lower servicing income, and lower net gains on mortgage loans, originations and sales.
Our work will continue during this year, which is expected to result in additional cost savings as well as reduced customer transfers and wait times.
Turning to our business segment starting on page 20, community banking earnings increased $353 million from the third quarter, driven by lower operating losses and income tax expense.
Turning to page 23, wholesale banking earnings declined $180 million from the third quarter driven by lower trading gains, investment banking fees and other income, which was partially, offset by higher loan fees and commercial real estate brokerage commissions.
Volatility in the equity markets during the fourth quarter impacted results, but helped to drive period end deposit growth.
However, we continued to have strong credit results with a net charge-off rate of 30 basis points in the fourth quarter.
For the fifth consecutive quarter, all of our commercial and consumer real estate loan portfolios were in a net recovery position and non-performing assets declined $280 million or 4% from the third quarter and were down 16% from a year ago.
So, in summary, in 2019 we plan to continue focusing on transforming Wells Fargo into a better bag, by improving risk management and customer service making Wells Fargo a great place to work, launching industry leading innovation, contributing to our communities and creating long term shareholder value.
But at the same time, weÂre continuing to actively work and implement the new risk management framework, as I mentioned, we detailed that in our third quarter 10-Q and as well as incorporating the input that weÂre getting back from the Fed along the way.
But, to your second question, I think the fourth quarter results reinforce our ability particularly when you look at loan growth, and you net out the impact of the legacy loan portfolios for example, in Pick-a-Pay from the asset sales or the decline in pre 2009 home equity portfolio.
And we want to reiterate today, and I hope you appreciated hearing that from both John and me, and IÂll say it a third time that our goal is to hit and achieve the expense targets that we provided you not only for this year, but through 2020.
We saw great loan growth in the fourth quarter some of that I think was either seasonal or reflecting what was going on in markets in the fourth quarter, which caused people to turn to their banks even more than they otherwise would have.
And I guess, at the current level of deposit beta, do you see a modest benefit still from a hike, and then, you know if you donÂt see a hike, is it really just come down to the loan growth and what we know in a quarter where thereÂs no rate hike, does NIM kind of trend flattish?
And then as I mentioned to Erika donÂt just kind of the importance of whatÂs going on with loan rates, because the curve has been flattening well, short rates have been coming up especially in the fourth quarter when we -- when we came crashing down well below 3%, and that really contributes on all of this incremental liquidity that keeps getting reinvested.
But, but I think, it has more to do with what happens with the general level of asset credit of loan growth and what happens to deposit pricing.
Our ability to provide good service to grow the number of primary checking account relationships our ability to grow loans, and as John pointed out, the lessening impact of the legacy portfolios or for example the credit decisions and the transformation that we made in our auto business, which John pointed out itÂs -- it's what we donÂt control, which is where the short end of the curve is going to be and the long end of the curve, and what the slope is going to be that is more of a question mark.
At the moment in business as usual, the impact of CECL would not require any massive reallocation of our capital, it may cause us to think a little bit differently about loan structures or loan pricing for certain types of particularly longer dated things, and maybe even more particularly on the consumer side.
On the loan growth side I just want to see regarding the fourth quarter trends, wanted to get a little bit more color on how youÂre thinking about how much of that fourth quarter strength in growth is possibly transient given the moves in the bond markets and everything versus whatÂs sticky, and what here can really gain?
It means that we sometimes, we miss some of the highs, but weÂre absolutely there for the lows, for our customers just like in the quarter when the capital markets seized up, we were there providing credit to all of our customers that needed it.
I mean, donÂt forget weÂve got a $950 billion loan portfolio and anyone credit is not going to drive the results of the company.
So I think itÂs harder to imagine it gapping upward, itÂs easy to imagine it gapping downwards, but itÂll always Â itÂs always been an adjustment that we, that we end up talking about, to the extent that it becomes the swing item in the quarter or for the year that weÂre pointing to say, but for that we would have hit our target or we wonÂt, we certainly wonÂt take credit for what you did, what we all know as a P&L neutral outcome to achieve a goal that is designed to be achieved the hard way, which is by managing expenses.
So given the environment weÂre in, as John mentioned in his comments, weÂve got to continue to grow our share with our customer base by providing better service, which their folks are really focused on.
And when this cycle does end, those are the loans that are probably going to have a higher default rate, and to the extent that we can find the right, the right buyer for those at prices that makes sense that will de-risk us from an operational risk perspective when that time comes, because there will be more will be more defaults.
I recognize it was a very tough quarter in terms of some of the market sensitive businesses and you spoke of some of the growth areas within 2019, whether it be mortgage release income, but because you have some of those headwinds in the wealth side as well that you noted you told me you can maybe frame, whatÂs the right jumping off point for the fee income to start the year?
Well thatÂs an excellent question, but the jump -- the stepping off point is the some of the stories in each of the lines and we really donÂt sort of wrap that up and put a single growth rate on it because thereÂs so many things that are driven by different forces, whether itÂs, as you said the S&P in the case of certain fee income lines, whatÂs going on, in the mortgage market, what are competitive positioning is?
",39.34,0.8017928
wellsfargo,q1,2019,"Thank you for joining our call today where our interim CEO and President, Allen Parker; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions.
Since assuming my new role, I've been focused on leading our Company forward by emphasizing my top priorities, serving our customers and supporting our Wells Fargo team members, meeting and exceeding the expectations of our regulators and continuing the important transformation of the Company.
We continue to strengthen Wells Fargo's leadership team with both internal promotions and external hires, including our Head of Technology, Saul Van Beurden who joined Wells Fargo earlier this week as a member of our operating committee.
In addition to these ongoing leadership changes, we're also realigning our business structure and making significant investments in key capabilities that taken together will help ensure that we meet the expectations of our regulators.
Simply put, we are engaged in a transformative effort with the goal of building the most customer-focused, efficient and innovative Wells Fargo ever, a premier financial institution characterized by a strong financial foundation, a leading presence in our chosen markets, focused growth within a responsible risk management framework, operational excellence and highly engaged team members.
So, let me just mention here that we adopted the new lease accounting standard in the first quarter, which had no meaningful impact on our P&L, but requires operating leases to be recognized now on the balance sheet as the right of use asset, increasing our other assets by $4.9 billion.
Page six, revenue grew 3% from the fourth quarter as lower net interest income was more than offset by growth in non-interest income, and I'll highlight the fee income drivers later on the call.
I'll highlight the driver of the linked quarter decline in period-end loans starting on page eight.
Our growth in the first quarter reflected our continued credit discipline and high-quality loan originations as well as less runoff of previously purchased loan portfolios.
Partially offsetting this decline was $4.2 billion of high-quality nonconforming loan growth, which excludes another $776 million that were designated as held for sale in anticipation of future securitizations.
Credit card loans declined $746 million from the fourth quarter, driven by expected seasonality.
Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $961 million from the fourth quarter on lower margin loans and other securities based lending, reflecting higher short-term rates as well as market volatility.
Average deposits declined $35.1 billion from a year ago, reflecting both lower wholesale banking deposits including actions taken in the first half of last year to manage to the asset cap, and lower wealth and investment management deposits as customers allocated more cash to higher-yielding liquid alternatives.
Average deposits declined $6.8 billion from the fourth quarter as lower wholesale banking deposits, driven by seasonality, were partially offset by higher consumer and small business banking deposits.
On average, deposit costs increased 10 basis points from the fourth quarter and 31 basis points from a year-ago, driven primarily by increases in wholesale and WIM deposit rates.
The cumulative one-year beta has increased to 43%, up from 38% last quarter, reflecting continued pricing competition across major deposit categories.
Wholesale banking deposits were down $37 billion from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting seasonality from typically higher fourth quarter levels.
Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $9.4 billion from higher retail banking deposits reflecting seasonality, as well as growth in CDs and high-yield savings.
Several factors have driven shifts in our view, including a lower absolute rate outlook, a flatter curve, tightening loan spreads resulting from a competitive market with ample liquidity and continued upward pressure on deposit pricing.
Net gains from trading activities rebounded from a weaker fourth quarter, increasing $347 million, driven primarily by strength in credit and asset-backed products.
Mortgage originations decline $5 billion from the fourth quarter, primarily due to expected seasonality, while the production margin increased to 105 basis points, primarily due to improvement in secondary market conditions.
We expect to see higher origination volume in the second quarter due to typical seasonality for home buying as well as some additional refinance activity resulting from the recent decrease and mortgage interest rates.
Trust and investment fees declined $147 million from the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower asset-based fees on retail brokerage advisory assets, reflecting lower market valuations on December 31st, which is when these assets were priced for first quarter revenue purposes.
These seasonally higher personnel expenses should decline in the second quarter, but salary expense is expected to grow, reflecting increases which became effective late in the first quarter as well as an additional payroll day in the second quarter.
Running the business nondiscretionary expense declined $580 million, primarily from lower core deposit and other intangibles as the 10-year amortization period on the Wachovia-related intangibles ended, and also from lower operating losses.
As a result, our actual and anticipated investment spend for 2018 through 2019 has increased by $1.4 billion from our expectations at our 2018 investor day.
The major categories of savings are from centralization and optimization, including staff function rationalization and advancing our contact center of the future, running the business, which includes streamlining our mortgage operations and restructuring our wholesale banking business as examples and governance and controls overspending, which is expected to further reduce third-party services spend and includes a consistent approach to manage our spans of control and hiring location guidelines for noncustomer facing team members.
Community banking earnings decreased $346 million from the fourth quarter, driven by seasonally higher personnel expense.
Wealth and investment management earnings declined $112 million from the fourth quarter, driven by lower asset-based fees, reflecting the lower 12/31 market valuations, which was when retail brokerage advisory assets were priced.
As Allen highlighted, earlier this week, we announced an agreement to sell our institutional retirement and trust business, which reflects our strategy by focusing our resources on areas where we believe we can grow and maximize our opportunities within wealth brokerage and asset management.
Our CET1 ratio fully phased in, increased 20 basis points from the fourth quarter as continued strong returns of capital even with seasonally higher share issuance in the first quarter were more than offset by capital generation from earnings, improved cumulative OCI and lower risk-weighted assets.
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
Yes, in part, I think because a lot our recent retail deposit gathering has been higher costs than historically.
Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
But, as I think about the dynamics of capital return and opportunities to continue to restructure the firm, so as of year-end 2018, Wells Fargo had 2,595 more employees than JP Morgan, and your employee base declined just 3% since 2009 and you have peer banks in the United States that have 50,000 less employees than do for larger asset bases.
Does that NII outlook -- does it assume any ongoing reinvestment of your excess liquidity position because I would assume that, if you do continue to use that to fund new loan originations, it could help temper the impact of the expectation that you're seeing on the deposit costs side?
This morning, I'll outline the actions I'm taking together with our leadership team to continue to transform Wells Fargo and to get that transformation right for all our stakeholders, including our customers, our team members, our shareholders and our regulators.
The team and I are committed to addressing these mistakes of the past, and over the coming weeks and months I plan to spend much of my time listening to our customers and working to understand how we can best serve them.
This team, which sits outside our lines of business, establishes our Companywide remediation policies, sets standards and coordinates with our lines of business in the day-to-day management of remediation efforts and provides our Board of Directors, our regulators and our senior management with comprehensive information about all customer remediation efforts that we are taking place at Wells Fargo.
While we're aggressively addressing our risk and control issues and building a better bank, I want to acknowledge clearly that we have a substantial amount of work yet to do, both to satisfy the expectations of our regulators and even more important, to create the financial institution we aspire to be.
But regardless of the status of the progress of any particular part of the necessary work, I want to make clear that the most important thing for our Company is that and our ongoing constructive engagement with the Federal Reserve.
We understand the seriousness of getting our work with the Federal Reserve right, and we are therefore making and will be willing to make the investments that are necessary to complete the work that's needed to improve our compliance and operational risk capabilities.
This work is fundamentally an evolution of our business model, and this evolution will both change how we manage compliance and operational risk, and by simplifying and strengthening our business processes help us serve our customers better and become more efficient, all of which will benefit our shareholders over the long term.
As you know, weÂre currently operating well below the asset cap, and we have had and will continue to have the ability to serve the needs of all our 700 million customers -- excuse me, 70 million customers, while we work to satisfy the requirements of the Federal Reserve consent order.
The work we're doing in conjunction with our regulators to improve operational effectiveness will make Wells Fargo a more simple and nimble company while at the same time bringing us closer to our customers, which is the real reason we're here.
Compared with the first quarter of Â18, revenue declined 1%, primarily driven by lower trust and investment fees, and mortgage banking fees, partially offset by 1% growth in net interest income.
Average loans increased $3.8 billion from the fourth quarter, the second consecutive linked quarter increase with growth in the commercial portfolio, partially offset by continued declines in the consumer portfolio.
Period-end loans increased $941 million from a year-ago, with growth in high-quality non-conforming first mortgage loans, C&I loans and credit card loans, largely offset by $6.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage and reliable consumer auto loan sales since the second quarter of 2018.
The first mortgage portfolio declined $520 million from the fourth quarter, driven by the sale of $1.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans.
We increased our auto origination market share with high-quality originations, and we currently expect our auto loan -- our auto portfolio balances to grow by midyear and as early as the second quarter.
Noninterest income increased $962 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher market sensitive revenue and mortgage banking fees.
Turning to page 24, wholesale banking earnings increased $99 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher market sensitive revenue and lower non-interest expense.
We continued to have strong credit results with a net charge-off rate of 30 basis points in the first quarter and net charge-offs down $26 million from the fourth quarter, driven by seasonally lower auto and other revolving credit and installment loan losses.
So, in summary, our first quarter results continue to reflect strong customer activity and some underlying positive business momentum, and we're on track to achieve our 2019 expense target.
And if deposit prices continue to lag and catch up to the historic beta, maybe things are a little bit stronger until later in the year, if that that catch-up takes until later in the year.
I would like to understand how the organization is thinking through those two things in the context of the question.
The most important thing, though, I think from my perspective is for everybody to understand that while the search is underway, the Company is going to continue to move forward assertively and decisively on the priorities that John and I have discussed this morning.
So, I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about the mortgage business that you run and how you deal with that, especially on the sourcing component.
And Betsy, with respect to your point about the mortgage business, and as you described the regulatory arbitrage, I would say that weÂre -- mortgage lending is core to Wells Fargo, it's very important to our customers.
We've changed the business over the last couple of years to take some of the extra contractual risks out of the origination and the servicing side of things and to try and make it as tolerable as possible in the complex environment that we're operating in.
The way we approach CCAR is starting with the feedback that we get in the prior year and working all year to improve our approach, which includes our operational risk identification, control identification, our scenario designed to impact those types of things, the impact more broadly on what it means both for PPNR generation.
I think, the work that's happening right now, which is frankly the underpinning a lot of the regulatory related requirements around operational risk and compliance is business process by business process, end to end understanding of how everything gets done at Wells Fargo in a very encyclopedic way.
But in the short-term as we're adding in places like the control functions and the businesses, and Mandy's team broadly in the second line of defense for risk and compliance, those will definitely be -- those will push numbers up in the short term.
We've had this discussion before that at the end of this process that for a company of our size relative to peers that you're mentioning, we have a lower risk mix of businesses.
And as we think about the timing of when you put out that guidance, earlier guidance on NII at the Credit Suisse conference, obviously the yield curve flattened, but is your sensitivity to the long end that material that this magnitude of change is not just significant relative to your old guide but also significant relative to peers?
So, on the long end, I would say that we have got more conviction that we're going to be reinvesting at lower rates for more of the year than moving with through the big rally in connection with the disruption of the fourth quarter.
And if that doesn't happen, as I mentioned to John, thatÂs going to be upside or I should say, move us higher in the range of possible outcomes for this year.
On the fee side, and I donÂt mean to be cheeky at all but excluding the idiosyncratic gains on Pick-a-Pay end and the payroll services company, John, what would you call core fees for the year -- sorry, for the quarter?
I guess, IÂd point to mortgage probably as this year rolls through and given where the pipeline sits and the fact that we're up a little bit higher in terms of gain on sale, and servicing frankly feels a little bit more stable compared to Q4.
I mean, I don't know if it's just that the regulators don't appreciate how big, how granular, how diverse a company you are, so, how long it takes or if it's just been maybe bigger issues than you appreciated a year ago.
I think, one of the most important things to understand is that what we're talking about, as I said earlier is essentially an evolution of our business model.
We have in essence picked out with our regulators a point on the horizon in terms of creating a truly extraordinary company, not only in terms of business performance and operational excellence, but also risk management.
The single most important thing I think to note is that we have really done a good job of restructuring our balance sheet so as to be able to operate under the asset cap for over a year.
Again, I think we've captured that in our outlook, but those trade-offs are being assessed every day because as you could -- at this point in time, with all of the -- the possibilities of what technology can bring to the businesses, there are -- there's a boundless list of things that we'd all like to do.
Obviously, Chris, as you know, we're -- when you talk about consent orders, we're looking at a number of different ones and some of them are in more focused areas in terms of our businesses and our operations.
With regard to the other parts of what we're doing, those things really focused on operational risk and compliance and I think just going back to your question, Chris, it's a combination.
I think it cannot be described as something that's being done on a whiteboard because there are number of reference points, but I would say, if anything, we are all trying to achieve something that maybe almost an outer boundary in terms of the quality of operational risk and compliance, something that hasn't really been achieved at this level before.
If there were other interesting things for us to invest in, whether it was loans or securities we'd do it, but on the securities front, I think given where we are in terms of yield of risk free rates and spreads, we've accounted for what is within our appetite and on the loan front, as I've mentioned before, we're competing vigorously in every market that we're enthusiastic about to grow loans.
I mean, this has been a very critical issue for the Company and it's been something that I think the management has been talking about for since the beginning.
The changes that Jon Weiss is making in running that business I think will continue to generate a high level of value creation.

wellsfargo,q2,2019,"Branch customer experience survey scores have now increased for four consecutive quarters and in June, reached their highest levels in over three years.
Reflecting our deep management team Mary Katherine DuBose, who joined Wells Fargo in 1998 and was most recently a leader in wholesale banking, has assumed the role of Chief Credit Officer and Jeremy Smith will lead market and counterparty risk.
My final top priority is continuing the important transformation of Wells Fargo so that we can build on our already strong foundation to become even more customer focused, innovative and better positioned for the future.
Our net charge-offs remained near historic lows at 28 basis points and our $150 million reserve release in the second quarter was the same amount as a year ago.
Period-end loans increased $5.6 billion from a year ago with growth in first mortgage, C&I and credit card loans partially offset by declines in junior lien mortgage loans as well as commercial real estate loans.
Commercial real estate loans increased $105 million from the first quarter, the second consecutive linked quarter increase, as growth in mortgage lending was partially offset by runoff of construction loans reflecting cyclicality of commercial real estate construction projects and our continued credit discipline.
Turning to deposits on page 11, average deposits declined $2.3 billion from a year ago as wealth and investment management and wholesale banking customers continue to allocate more cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives.
Our deposit beta reflects current market conditions, including repricing lags from prior Fed Funds rate increases and deposit campaigns for new retail deposits, which have resulted in a greater percentage of higher yielding promotional deposit balances.
Wholesale banking deposits were up $37.4 billion from the first quarter with growth in corporate and investment banking, commercial real estate and corporate trust and also included an elevated level of large short-term deposit inflows.
Consumer and small business banking deposits declined $12 billion driven by lower wealth and investment management deposits from the seasonality of tax payments, as well as clients continuing to reallocate cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives.
And in the second quarter, we send an average of more than 38 million zero balance and customer specific alerts a month and helped over 1 million customers avoid overdraft charges through overdraft rewind.
Residential held for sale mortgage loan originations totaled $33 billion in the second quarter, and the production margin on these originations declined to 98 basis points, down 7 basis points due to sales execution timing.
New consumer checking customers acquired through the digital channel were up 45% from a year ago and 48% of new general purpose credit card accounts were originated through the digital channel in the second quarter.

Let me close by thanking all of you for joining the second quarter conference call.
Thank you for joining our call today where our Interim CEO and President, Allen Parker; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions.
And thanks for joining us for today's discussion of our second quarter results, which included strong quarterly earnings.
On our call last quarter, I outlined my three top priorities for Wells Fargo, which are focusing on our customers and team members; meeting the expectations of our regulators, and continuing our company's important transformation.
And by continuing to meet our wholesale banking customersÂ needs for asset-based financing during the quarter, we increased our industry leading market share in these financings.
Now with most of these transformational changes complete, our auto portfolio returned to growth in the second quarter for the first time since 2016 and in line with our expectations.
On the next page, we summarize noteworthy items in the second quarter, including a $721 million gain on the sale of $1.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans.
The remaining balance in the Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio was $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter, down from $8.8 billion a year ago, reflecting portfolio sales and runoff.
We highlight some year-over-year results on page four, compared with the second quarter 2018 revenue was stable with an increase of $477 million in noninterest income largely offset by a $446 million decline in net interest income.
The average loan yield was up 16 basis points from a year ago from the repricing impacts of higher interest rates, and it declined 4 basis points from the first quarter due to changes in loan mix and the repricing impact of lower interest rates.
IÂll highlight the drivers of the $1.6 billion linked quarter increase in period-end loans starting on page nine.
Commercial loans increased $19 million from the first quarter, C&I loans were down $288 million, as growth in our credit investment portfolio from purchasing CLOs in loan form was offset by declines in commercial capital, corporate and investment banking and commercial real estate credit facilities to REITs and non-depository financial institutions.
38% of our total mortgage originations in the second quarter were held for investment, which was up from 26% a year ago.
Average deposits increased $6.9 billion from the first quarter driven by higher retail banking deposits, reflecting increased promotional activity, partially offset by lower wealth and investment management deposits.
Our average deposit costs of 70 basis points increased 5 basis points from the first quarter and 30 basis points from a year ago, reflecting higher deposit rates in wholesale banking and wealth and investment management, deposit mix shifts as customers allocated more balances to higher yielding categories, and retail banking deposit campaign pricing for new deposits.
If the Fed Funds rate remains at current levels, we expect our cumulative through the cycle beta to continue to trend upward albeit at the lower end of our previously guided range of 45% to 55%.
On page 13, we provide details on period end deposits, which increased $24.4 billion from the first quarter.
Net interest income decreased $216 million from the first quarter, driven by balance sheet mix and repricing including the impact of higher deposit costs and lower interest rate environment, as well as $73 million from increased premium amortization costs from higher MBS prepayments.
Net interest income was down 4% in the second quarter and down 2% in the first half of 2019, compared with the same periods a year ago.
Last quarter, we said we expected net interest income to decline 2% to 5% this year compared with 2018.
Turning to page 15, noninterest income increased $191 million from the first quarter, with broad base growth including higher trust and investment fees, other income, service charges on deposit accounts, card fees and mortgage banking.
We expected deposit service charges to increase now that the customer friendly changes we've made, which meaningfully reduce these fees are fully on the run rate.
The increase in deposit service charges in the second quarter also reflected higher treasury management fees in wholesale banking.
Mortgage banking revenue increased $50 million from the first quarter, as lower servicing income primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, including higher loan payoffs was offset by higher mortgage origination fees.
The decline in compensation and benefits reflected $676 million in seasonally lower personnel expense and $243 million in lower deferred compensation expense, which is P&L neutral, partially offset by the full quarter impact from salary increases, as well as one additional payroll day.
As we show on page 18, expenses were down $533 million from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses, core deposit and other intangibles amortization and FDIC expense.
We currently expect our 2019 expenses to be near the high end of our target range, as investments in risk management, including data and technology have exceeded expectations and are anticipated to continue.
Turning to our business segments starting on page 20, community banking earnings increased $324 million from the first quarter, driven by seasonally lower personnel expense.
We have $30 million digital active customers in the second quarter, up 4% from a year ago, including 8% growth in mobile active customers.
On page 22, we highlight the decline in teller and ATM transactions, down 7% from a year ago, reflecting continued customer migration to digital channels, and we consolidated 38 branches in the second quarter.
Turning to page 23, wholesale banking earnings increased $19 million from the first quarter, driven by lower provision for credit losses.
Wealth and investment management earnings increased $25 million from the first quarter, driven by seasonally lower personnel expense and higher asset based fees.
Turning to page 25, we continue to have strong credit results with our net charge-off rate declining to 28 basis points in the second quarter, and net charge-offs down $42 million from the first quarter, driven by lower consumer losses.
In summary, our second quarter results reflected increased customer activity, strong credit performance and higher capital returns.
They haven't flown to the bottom line because you've had incremental investments in things like I believe risk management, regulatory compliance, operational risk.
Because I would think that at some point you have these investments in the run rate, and you actually start to see it flow to the bottom line, especially given what -- to be what seems like somewhat bloated cost structure relative to your peers.
On the business sale side you guys have talked about I think the expected contribution or detraction from the retirement sales and then Eastdil in the fourth quarter.
Wanted to just ask another question on expenses if I may, so you mentioned that you had concluded this quarter that there is a little bit more work to do and given consensus expectations for 2020 of $51 billion.
And 2020 is going to be impacted by where we finish this year, what's going on with loan and deposit flows, this discussion about where deposit pricing for our peers -- for us and our peers is at that time, depending on whether the Fed is marching down or if things are very stable, and of course, could go either way and itÂs relatively benign economic environment overall and can't see a compelling course for much more action than what people are currently imagining or having priced in.
One thing that we haven't talked about and as much as these rate cuts and the interest rate environment are making a little bit harder for us to make money to the extent that they really do elongate this recovery and we end up with benign credit conditions and we end up with robust consumer spending and flows and businesses remain healthy and borrow and continue to invest even at these relatively subdued levels.
So I can't -- that matters in terms of how we respond to the question, because of the rates of loan and deposit growth will be different in the continued expansion than they would be without it.
It's the second line in the financial services parlance, but there are people in control functions in the businesses who are doing the actual work, right.
Again, because stress capital buffer works as a point estimate and is -- and can create that kind of volatility, if whether it's by multi-year averaging, or in some other way, they reduce the risk of a hard transition like that then we may very well consider operating with capital target that we have today.
On deposit service charges, so, yes, we're comping over the customer friendly actions, we did have a disproportionate level of fee waivers in the first quarter, which makes the first quarter to the second quarter probably look like a little bit of steeper jump than I would trend from this point forward.
",38.89,0.75204164
wellsfargo,q3,2019,"We had $244 million in mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments driven predominantly by higher prepayment rate estimates on our MSRs. These valuation adjustments resulted in our mortgage banking revenue declining from the second quarter despite an increase in mortgage originations and higher production margins.
These increases were partially offset by declines in commercial banking and lower government and institutional banking and middle market lending and in commercial capital driven by seasonally lower commercial distribution finance dealer floor plan loans.
Commercial real estate loans declined $2.2 billion from the second quarter with declines in both commercial real estate mortgage and commercial real estate construction loans reflecting increased market liquidity, higher refinancing activity, and continued credit discipline.
Our market share growth reflects the benefit of the transformational changes we have made in the business including process improvements that have resulted in faster credit decision response times.
Net interest income declined $470 million from the second quarter primarily due to balance sheet re-pricing driven by the impact of the lower interest rate environment as well as $133 million of higher MBS premium amortization costs due to higher pre-payments.
Mortgage banking revenue declined $292 million from the second quarter driven by a $419 million decline in servicing income primarily due to the valuation adjustments on our MSRs reflecting higher prepayment rate estimates.
Partially offsetting this decline was $127 million increase in net gains on mortgage loan originations and sales activities.
Residential held for sale mortgage loan originations totaled $38 billion in the third quarter and the production margin on these originations increased to 121 basis points with higher margins in both retail and correspondent channels, driven by capacity constraints.
The increase in compensation and benefits reflected higher salaries expense primarily driven by one additional day in the quarter, a change in staffing mix and higher severance expense partially offset by lower deferred comp expense.
Turning to our Business segments starting on page 19, community banking earnings declined $2.1 billion from the second quarter, primarily driven by higher operating losses reflecting higher litigation accruals.
Our internal credit grades are at their strongest levels in two years and since third quarter of 2017 our criticized loan balances have declined 20% with broad-based improvement across all commercial asset classes.

Let me close our call by thanking all of you for your questions and for joining our third quarter conference call.
Thank you for joining our call today where our Interim CEO and President, Allen Parker; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions.
That strength was demonstrated by, among other things, increases in loan and deposit balances both from the second quarter and from a year ago, our highest branch customer experience scores in over three years, and continued growth in primary consumer checking customers.
While our financial results in the third quarter were impacted by these items, as Allen summarized and we highlight on slide three, we continue to have positive business momentum with strong customer activity.
Compared with the third quarter of 2018, revenue was stable with an increase of $1 billion in non-interest income driven by the sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business, largely offset by a $947 million decline in net interest income.
Our effective income tax rate increased to 22.1% in the third quarter, reflecting a net discrete income tax expense of $443 million, predominantly related to the non-tax-deductible treatment of the $1.6 billion discrete litigation accrual.
Turning to page seven, average loans were up $10.3 billion from a year ago and increased $2.3 billion from the second quarter.
Turning to deposits on page 11, average deposits increased 2% from both a year ago and the second quarter.
Average deposits increased $22.4 billion from the second quarter with growth in wholesale banking as well as retail banking deposits which continue to benefit from promotional rates and offers.
The increase from the second quarter was driven by continued retail deposit campaign pricing for new deposits so that we begun lower promotional rates in terms in response to market conditions.
On page 12, we provide details on period-end deposits which grew 3% from a year ago and 2% from the second quarter.
Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $11.9 billion from the second quarter driven by higher retail banking deposits including growth in high yield savings and CDs. These increases were partially offset by a $2.5 billion reduction in corporate Treasury deposits, the second consecutive quarter of declines.
As always, net interest income will be influenced by a number of factors including loan growth, pricing spreads, the level of rates and the slope of the yield curve.
Turning to page 14, non-interest income increased $896 million for the second quarter driven by the gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business.
Turning to expenses on page 15, expenses increased from both the second quarter and a year ago, largely due to higher operating losses, primarily reflecting litigation accruals.
Turning to page 22, wholesale banking earnings declined $145 million from the second quarter, driven by lower net interest income reflecting the impact of the lower interest rate environment.
Wealth and investment management earnings increased $678 million from the second quarter, driven by the gain on the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business.
Turning to page 24, we continue to have strong credit results with our net charge-off rate declining to 27 basis points in the third quarter.
Credit card net charge-offs have been relatively stable as we've been thoughtful in our efforts to generate new account growth, including the launch of our Propel American Express Card last year, and while auto and net charge-offs increased from the second quarter due to seasonality, they were down from a year ago even as we've grown originations by 45%.
In summary, while we had a number of significant items that impacted our third quarter financial results, we had strong underlying business fundamentals, including growth in loans and deposits, increased customer activity, strong credit performance, and higher capital returns.
Yes, well, it's complicated, because there's a lot of things going into it include where rates go versus what the market is suggesting, what happens with loan pricing, deposit pricing, and a variety of things, but if we, in the various scenarios that we run thinking about, let's say, the 9/30 implied forward curve, which suggests Fed funds in the 170 area, 12/31 of this year the 10-year just under 170, and then a year forward, Fed funds in the 120 area and Fed funds still in the 170 -- pardon me, 10-year still in the 170 area.
John, sort of a follow-up question on costs, I guess if I look at the reiterated 2019 expense guide, it implies a pretty meaningful downdraft in costs in the 4Q, maybe if you could just take a moment to go through sort of the puts and takes and how you bring costs down in the coming quarter?
With the deposit cost increases slowing, might we have seen kind of the end of the deposit cost rise for you guys this quarter assuming rates stay flat to down from here, kind of just trying to think if this could be the max paying quarter for NIM where you had the deposit costs up and loan yields down, and maybe some just puts and takes for the fourth quarter on NIM versus this quarter?
Yes, so my expectation is that deposit costs will be cheaper in the fourth quarter reflecting what you described in terms of kind of the burning out of the higher cost deposits that got layered in before the Fed began to ease.
I think we should -- maybe it was last quarter, one of the things that we mentioned is that we're building a control environment for the company as it exists today, and there is just through process consolidation and process reengineering, there's an opportunity for the company to be a whole lot more simplified as we roll forward, and both the cost of delivery and the cost of overseeing that from a risk and control perspective would be expected to be more efficient.
Hey, John, one follow-up on the NII side, so you keeping their minus 6 NII I got for the year kind of gets you 11 fours for the year, and down even five next year kind of holds you at that 11 four-ish, and so I know there're so many potential permutations of what happens with the rate environment, but maybe you can just help us talk through how much you expect the balance sheet to grow then, or how -- versus how close you're starting to get towards the asset cap, and what constraints if anything, might you have as this gets further out?
I mean within the relevant range of expectations of loan and deposit growth, I wouldn't think of the asset cap as being as really coming into play in our forecast horizon, in part, because there are plenty of levers that we can pull that don't have real customer impact in terms of consumers and our business customers, and we've talked about some of those before in terms of some of the institutional deposits that we take or other wholesale funding that we use, and then, there are some assets that don't work that hard for us from a balance sheet perspective.
So, I guess the low single-digit growth rates for loans and deposits is probably a reasonable proxy for a reasonable placeholder for thinking about how 2020 unfolds, could be a range of different outcomes, but that would be consistent with what I mentioned earlier in terms of how you might forecast the different rate paths and getting to a low to mid single-digits down percentage in net interest income for 2020 versus 2019.
Understood, thanks, and a follow-up on the fee side, we got the IRT coming out, did you spoke about it, was in the deck, and then you've got Estill [ph], can you just help us understand how you are thinking about how that just nets out as we get past this year as well in terms of revenue and expense trajectory?
Estill coming out starting in the fourth quarter, it was probably a little bit bigger in terms of dollars of revenue per quarter, and you'll see it mostly in the commercial mortgage brokerage line item in the P&L, it shows up in a couple of others areas too and have investment banking fees, but similarly the expenses approximate the revenue in our own experience.
Staying on the loan growth topic, you saw some pretty good declines in the commercial real estate portfolios this quarter again and just want to get your updated thoughts there, that's the one area that you're expect to see some runoff still or another words lack of growth, I guess?
And so we really have to pick our spots in order to maintain our risk reward, credit and pricing and loan terms quality, and it's also one of those areas where, frankly, your weakest loans end up getting refinanced away from you, which is also late cycle behavior by the way, so we're still very comfortable with what we have on the books, but I wouldn't look for it to grow meaningfully until the cycle turns and until our best customers have really interesting opportunities to put their own capital to work and we help them do it.
And then just specifically like as we think about, you know, exiting fourth quarter at net interest income, you're obviously going to be caring or absorbing higher than normal bond premium amortization.
And then just last question all this, as we think about exiting this year, just assuming rates stay where they are now, does that go to zero or there's still going to be just some ongoing amount in the fourth quarter?
I appreciate it, if you don't want to comment on this too much, but just going back to the legal reserve estimate, understanding the official number will come out in the Q, but we had that $800 million jump and now we're getting that $1.6 billion charge or the jump in the high-end of the legal reserve estimate, and now the charge in the current quarter and just the operating losses, and just curious if there's any color on, do you get a sense we're starting to get more towards the light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to this?

wellsfargo,q4,2019,"Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Charlie Scharf and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions.
Our franchises are world class and are in the sweet spot of providing necessary financial services for consumers, small businesses and middle market and large corporate companies.
The output of this work will provide us roadmaps to not only improve our performance within each business, but also position us to understand our opportunities across the company and prioritize accordingly.
We had a $153 million linked-quarter decrease in low income housing tax credit investment income, reflecting a timing change of expected tax benefit recognition.
But I want to highlight that our effective income tax rate was 19.1% in the fourth quarter, which included a net discrete income tax expense of $303 million, predominantly related to the non-tax-deductible treatment of certain litigation accruals.
Originations were down 1% linked quarter on seasonality but increased 45% from a year ago, reflecting a renewed emphasis on growing auto loans following the restructuring of the business.
Our average deposit cost of 62 basis points increase 7 basis points from year ago, reflecting promotional pricing in retail banking for new deposits earlier in the year and the mix shift to higher costs deposit -- higher cost products across our consumer and commercial businesses.
Our average deposit cost declined 9 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting lower rates in wholesale banking and WIM.
We did not run any broad based retail banking marketing promotions for deposits during the fourth quarter.
However, retail banking deposits increased 2 basis points due to the continued impact from previous promotional campaigns and deposit gathering strategies over the past year when interest rates were higher.
While we continue to offer our customers competitive promotional savings and CD rates within our branches, retail Banking deposit costs are expected to start to decline in the first quarter as higher promotional rates expire.
Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $16 billion from the third quarter, driven by higher retail banking deposits, including growth and high yield savings and interest bearing checking.
Mortgage Banking revenues increased $317 million from the third quarter.
Servicing income was up $165 million due to a negative MSR valuation adjustment in the third quarter, reflecting higher prepayment rates.
Net gains on mortgage loan originations also increased from higher gains associated with exercising service or clean up calls in the fourth quarter.
Net gains from equity securities were down $505 million from the third quarter as lower gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships were partially offset by $240 million increase in deferred comp plan investment results, which again are largely P&L neutral.
Running the business non-discretionary expense increased by $1.5 billion of higher operating losses, partially offset by lower core deposit and other intangibles amortization expense.
Community Banking earnings declined $570 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by lower net interest income and lower net gains from equity securities.
Our customer satisfaction scores improved by 9 points from last year study, the largest increase among our large bank peers.
Wholesale banking earnings declined $151 million from the third quarter, driven by lower revenue.
And total client assets increased 10% from a year ago on higher market valuations, including 18% growth in retail brokerage advisory assets.
Closed referred investment assets resulting from the partnership between WIM and Community Banking were up 18% in the fourth quarter compared with the year ago with December having over $1 billion in closed referrals our strongest month since June of 2017.
While the allowance for consumer credit losses is expected to be $1.5 billion higher under CECL, reflecting longer or indeterminate maturities that have recoveries and collateral value predominantly related to residential mortgage loans, which have been written down significantly below current recovery value during the last credit cycle.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonnell with Autonomous Research.
So early on here while we're still going through this planning process, I wouldn't expect that much to change other than the -- some of the adjustments that we all make for deferred comp, for excess operating losses et cetera.
So that we originally talked about the $600 million, it reflected the $150 million per quarter of fraud related losses and other run rate operating losses without regard for what's been elevated over the last couple of years.
The bulk of the C&I loan growth overall did come from commercial or corporate investment banking related activity.
The trust and investment fees should step off at a high level, because they price off of the opening deck, which for the S&P looks good for the coming quarter, that leverage it creates cyclicality that works for us and against us.
Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
John, can you share with us, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expected the net interest income to be down low to mid-single digits for 2020 over 2019.
I guess, now a year and a half ago, but it used to be the case that we'd have to actually realize something to recognize the benefit something have to be sold or go public in order for us to take a gain and these days even with private companies doing subsequent private capital raises.
Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
I know you're going to have equity market tailwinds just from what happened in the fourth quarter as we enter the year in 2020, but I'm just hoping if you could frame whether that $32 billion annualized run rate is a reasonable jumping-off point after adjusting for some of those factors or anything else that you would cite for that matter?
Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
And then without putting any specific numbers around it like as you think about improving efficiency, there are comments as it could be both kind of revenue and expenses, should we think about it being somewhat balanced or the vast majority coming from expenses or too early to know right now?
Your final question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.
It's been a busy time as I have been working to get to know the company, our opportunities and challenges and I've learned a lot.
These changes are in addition to many other senior people who have joined the company over the past few years in important roles, such as Heads of Risk, HR, internal audits, and technology.
We had a number of significant items in the fourth quarter that impacted our results, which we highlight on Page 2 of our supplement.
While our financial results in the fourth quarter were impacted by these items, as we show on Page 3, we continue to have positive business momentum with strong customer activity, which I'll highlight throughout the call.
Commercial loans increased $3.4 billion from the third quarter, driven by broad-based C&I growth in corporate and investment banking.
On Page 12, we provide details on period end deposits, which grew 3% from a year ago and 1% from the third quarter.
Wholesale banking deposits were up $15.9 billion from the third quarter, driven by seasonality and growth in existing and new customer balances.
On the earnings call last quarter, we said we expected our 2019 expenses to be approximately $53 billion, which was at the high end of our $52 billion to $53 billion target range.
Wealth and Investment Management earnings declined $1 billion from the third quarter, which included $1.1 billion pretax gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business.
We continue to have strong credit results with 32 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter.
In summary, while we had a number of significant items that impacted our fourth quarter financial results and our expenses remain too high, we continue to have positive underlying business fundamentals, including growth in loans and deposits, increased customer activity and strong credit performance.
I will say that in the time that I spent with Saul Van Beurden, who is our Head of Technology at the company, we have a really clear list of the work that we have to do, to both improve the underlying infrastructure of the institution, which will benefit our ability to grow at some point, because it really contributes to our ability to servicing all of our clients across all of our different segments, as well as we possibly can.
At the same time, it's clear when I spent time with all of our folks that we are thinking about where we go next and how we use technology to create different experiences and we see it in terms of some of the things that we've done in the digital space on the consumer side.
Charlie, to your points about just going after all the things to put the company on the right foot forward.
So on the first question, I think when you're on the inside of the company and we're managing the work that has to get done the way that we are, we have clear reporting, we have clear goals, item by item by item.
And just one follow up on your point that couple months in, you said you're going to look at like 10 business lines and just see where we should think about things from a bottom up.
From what you at least see now, is the company what it needs to look like going forward, the company has been trimming out of some areas over the course of time?
And so that goes to asking the question, are we spending appropriately on the historical issues and that number will be whatever we think it should be.
And so when we look at all the additional resources that have been added to support these activities, it's very difficult for you all to see what we have gained in terms of efficiency, because you should just assume that our expenses would be substantially higher if we hadn't been generating efficiencies in the rest of the company over last several years.
And so that's why were just being very, very careful about leading you to a specific number, because we're not sure where that all nets itself out and we want the time to be thoughtful about how to put it all together in a way that we certainly believe is the right long-term thing for the company.
She is responsible for a whole series of things from deposits to treasury services, to card, to innovation, digital marketing, a very, very wide range of things and we're actively working through what the right way to structure the company is with her retirement.
So I think answering the question of what that all looks like by the end of the year at this point is even premature.
I think we will be talking about realized results and what drove them over the course of the year, including closure of issues to the extent that those are public items and then how we set ourselves up in our stakeholders up for what comes next.
So another question on the regulatory side, I think one of the things regulators always had said is they wanted to see a change in the culture at the bank as the sign that things are improving.
And I think as an outsider coming in, I do have the opportunity to make some observations of some of the things that we do versus some of the things that I've seen that could help to make the company successful, going through issues that are somewhat like this.
And so, I do think that these changes that I spoke about are important to helping us be more successful at closing these issues in a way that has eluded us at this point.
John, I want to ask you first, this $1.5 billion is a big number for this particular quarter.
So again, I think what's relevant is that I've been able to come in with this fresh set of eyes, believe that we have an opportunity to manage these blocks of work differently with both a different set of processes, some different people and a great deal of my time and attention, as well as the rest of the senior management team.
And I guess maybe a different way to think about it is when you've seen these things happened in the past.
And they've set their strategic priorities and direction, and they are different than what had been under development in terms of the technology to support different parts of the business over the past few years, which is what resulted in the impairment to capitalize software development costs.
And so, like any other year on an adjusted basis, you'd expect them to be higher in the first quarter and gravitate down over the course of the year, as Charlie mentioned, we're going through a second look at our planning process for the year.
But like any other company, we should sit and ask the question, do we need to be doing absolutely everything and we have been pruning along the way.
There are some of these that we believe that even while we're doing our work we should be driving and growing and then some that will reflect the cycle of the market that we're in mortgage comes to mind in terms of where we are in the rate cycle and things like that.
That's not to say to get the best-in-class that we won't need some revenue growth to get there, but I just find it very encouraging the way people internally are thinking about it and what they're talking about as the types of things that'll be in the line of sight.
Again, I know it's too early to give a more accurate expense expectation, but I know you're going through your planning process, so what's the timing, when should we think we will get a more precise expectation when it comes to full year expenses, Charlie?

wellsfargo,q1,2020,"Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions.
Then John will provide more details on the first quarter results before we take your questions.
But the banks including Wells Fargo are financially strong and they've done a great job as many other industries have in providing continued service while many of our employees have been unable to access their offices.
Within wealth and investment management, period and deposit balances increased 30% during the quarter driven by higher retail brokerage sweeps, reflecting higher client cash allocations.
And despite market declines Wells Fargo Asset Management AUM still grew 2% during the quarter driven by strong inflows into money market funds.
Commercial loans grew $52 billion or 10% from the fourth quarter, and overall global debt capital markets activity was the strongest on record driven by high grade offerings from US issuers whose volumes were up 63% compared to a year ago.
Wells Fargo's high grade debt capital markets lead table rankings improved from fourth to third with 9.2% fee based market share during the quarter.
While deferred compensation plan investment results did not meaningfully impact the bottom line, they increased net losses from equity securities by $621 million and reduced employee benefits expense by $598 million.
We had $464 million of operating losses which were down $1.5 billion from the fourth quarter that included elevated litigation accruals.
Mortgage banking income declined $404 million from the fourth quarter driven by mark-to-market losses on loans held for sale and higher MSR asset valuation losses as a result of assumption updates primarily prepayment estimates.
Credit card loans declined $2.4 billion from the fourth quarter driven by seasonality and fewer new account openings.
This growth included the late quarter impacts of flight to quality deposits across all business lines following the emergence of COVID-19 as well as the inflow of deposits associated with corporate and commercial loan draws.
Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $41.1 billion, or 5% from the fourth quarter, including higher retail banking deposits largely driven by growth in high yield savings and interest bearing checking.
Net interest income increased $112 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting $356 million higher hedge ineffectiveness accounting results attributable to the level of market rates and differences in basis in notional and swaps hedging our long term debt.
$84 million of lower MBS premium amortization resulting from lower realized prepays partially offset by balance sheet re-pricing, including the impact of lower interest rate environment as our assets re-priced down faster than our liabilities and from one fewer day of the quarter.
Lower mortgage banking income reflected unrealized losses of approximately $143 million on residential loans, and $62 million on commercial loans held for sale due to illiquid market conditions and a widening of credit spreads.
This impact is recorded in net gain on mortgage loan originations and the $143 million loss reduced the production margin we report on residential held for sale originations.
Mortgage banking results also reflected $192 million of higher losses on the valuation of our MSR asset as a result of assumption updates primarily prepayment estimates.
Net losses from equity securities also included $935 million of impairments, reflecting lower market valuation.
Operating losses declined $1.5 billion from the fourth quarter, which included elevated litigation accruals.
Community banking earnings declined $274 million from the fourth quarter reflecting higher provision expense as well as net losses from equity securities.
Turning to Page 27, teller and ATM transactions are reported through March which is when we reduced our branch hours and temporarily closed approximately one fourth of our branches as a result of COVID-19, which resulted in approximate 50% decline in teller volume during the final weeks in the first quarter compared with a year ago.
Period-end deposit balances increased 13% from the fourth quarter, reflecting higher cash allocation and brokerage client assets and assets under management and our Wells Fargo Asset Management business grew significantly driven by over $34 billion of inflows into our money market funds.
Despite the market volatility closed referred investment assets into WIM from the consumer bank partnership increased on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis and flows into our retail brokerage advisory business remain positive in the first quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
Hi, thanks for taking my questions Charlie and John, couple of things.
Good morning, I'm going to open the call with comments on the current environment, the actions we're taking, our business performance and ongoing work to transform the company.
In the month of March alone, our commercial customers utilized over $80 billion of their loan commitments, and we're providing accommodations for clients in need.
Turning to the quarter, you can see that results were materially impacted by loan loss reserves, impairment of securities and redemption of deferred securities.
Our results included a reserve build of $3.1 billion for loans and debt securities, 950 million of securities impairment predominantly related to equity securities and a negative $0.06 impact related to the redemption of our Series K Preferred Stock.
We had $4 billion of provision expense for credit losses, reflecting the expected impact these unprecedented times could have on our customer's creditworthiness.
Turning to Page 8, I'll be covering the income statement drivers throughout the call, but I wanted to highlight that our effective income tax rate was 19.5% in the first quarter, and included net discrete income tax expense of $141 million.
I'll be highlighting most of the balance sheet drivers on Page 9 throughout the call, but I will note here that the economic environment our customers are facing due to COVID-19 caused our balance sheet to expand as loan demand and deposit inflows increased significantly late in the first quarter.
Driven by strong loan demand Â loan growth in March, our total assets grew $53.8 billion from year end to $1.981 trillion.
As Charlie highlighted even with this growth, we continue to operate in compliance with the asset cap of $1.952 trillion, as compliance is measured at each quarter end based on the two-quarter daily average.
During these challenging times, we expect load and deposit growth could continue, but cannot provide guidance on the level of growth and we're actively working to create balance sheet capacity to help our customers.
Let's look at the drivers with the balance sheet growth we had in the first quarter starting with average loans on Page 11.
Period-end loans increased $61.6 billion or 6% from a year ago, and $47.6 billion or 5% from the fourth quarter.
Commercial loans grew $52 billion or 10% from the fourth quarter as balance sheet declines earlier in the first quarter were more than offset by strong growth late in the quarter.
The growth in commercial loans in the first quarter included more than $80 billion in borrower draw activity in the month of March on commercial banking and corporate investment banking loans.
Consumer loans were down $4.4 billion, or 1% from the fourth quarter as declines in credit card loans, consumer real estate loans and other revolving loans were partially offset by growth in auto loans.
Junior lien mortgage loans were down $982 million from the fourth quarter as continued pay downs more than offset new originations and $1.8 billion of draws on existing lines, which was up meaningfully late in the first quarter.
Turning to commercial loans on Page 14, C&I loans were up $50.9 billion from the fourth quarter with broad based growth across business lines, largely driven by draws of revolving lines of clients reacting to the economic slowdown associated with a pandemic.
Commercial real estate loans were up 1.8 billion from the fourth quarter, with growth in both CRE mortgage and construction loans.
Turning to the entertainment and recreation industry on Slide 17, we had a total of $16.2 billion of loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, with less than 1% to cruise lines.
At the end of the first quarter, we had $14.1 billion of loans outstanding to retail excluding shopping centers, within the commercial real estate mortgage portfolio and $10.6 billion in loans outstanding for the hotel, motel industry.
We had largely declines in wholesale banking and WIM while our retail banking deposit costs declined at a slower pace, since they were lower to begin with and continue to be impacted from promotional pricing in early 2019, most of which will expire in the second quarter.
On Page 20, we provide details on period-end deposits, which better reflect the strong growth we had at the end of the first quarter, with total deposits up $53.9 billion, or 4% from year end.
Also, banking deposits were up $13.5 billion from the fourth quarter driven by commercial banking and commercial real estate revolving line draws, partially offset by lower financial institutions deposits, reflecting actions taken to manage the asset cap.
Turning to Page 22, noninterest income declines $2.3 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by a $1.9 billion decline in net gains from equity securities, and $404 million of lower mortgage banking income.
Turning to Page 28, wholesale banking earnings declined $2.2 billion from the fourth quarter, reflecting a $2.2 billion increase in provision expense.
I've already highlighted the strong loan and deposit growth from our commercial customers in the first quarter.
Turning to Page 30, our net charge-off rate was up six basis points from the fourth quarter to 38 basis points, predominantly driven by higher C&I losses primarily related to higher losses in our oil and gas portfolio, reflecting significant declines in oil prices.
Oil and gas loans outstanding increased 5% linked quarter and 7% from a year ago, reflecting increased utilization rates, driven by the impact of COVID-19 and the decline in oil prices.
This increase was driven by a number of factors including economic sensitivity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the estimated impact to industries most adversely affected by the pandemic, our exposure to the oil and gas industry, draws on loan commitments during the quarter, which were the primary driver of commercial loan growth, and a $141 million reserve build for debt securities reflecting economic and market conditions.
With respect to the other tradeoffs, as I mentioned, the first places that we're going to be able to create more capacity to help customers are to reduce non-operational deposits, principally in the financial institutions area, where relatively easily substitutable and it's a low value use of cap balance sheet because there's a high runoff factor on those types of deposits and there are tens of billions of dollars of those types of deposits to continue to work down.
And second question, John, understanding fully the pulling away from giving full year guidance, is there a way you can help us understand on the NII front, just how you'd expect the trajectory at least to go from first to second, given the changes and all the moving parts that were in this quarter's results?
We've got the Â I think we're all forecasting something like zero in the front end or with depending on where LIBOR moves over time, and then some number between call it 70 and 100 basis points at the long-end.
A couple of questions, one, just on the outlook for CECL and CECL charges, I mean, you obviously went through in detail what you did this most recent quarter, but just trying to understand what kind of unemployment level you're assuming in that just so if we see a trajectory differently from your assumptions, we know how to think about reserve builds from here.
I mean, the price is obviously a little bit lower, but I'm thinking that your book has changed a bit, maybe if you give us some color on how you're dealing with that portfolio and what your expectations are there?
We would continue to monitor where your capital levels are relative to the minimum and because of the balance sheet restriction, unlike some peers, you are less able to eat through your capital through RWA growth, is that the right way to think about the dividend going forward?
And also just clarify what you said John, you said that potentially the losses, the cumulative losses, this cycle would be 50% of the severely adverse, which I think for nine quarters was 26 billion.
John, I think you mentioned at one point during the call, there has perhaps been a little bit of an abating in the pace of line of credit draws.
And as I mentioned in response to the question about NII guidance, whether or not those balances remain outstanding will have an impact on this quarter one way or the other.
Having said that these types of customers will have stress often in their origination function, if they're an originator or in their ongoing capital accumulation if they're an asset manager, there can be stressed on the servicing side of this for those that are our residential mortgage oriented, their life's going to be a little bit harder, presumably as servicing, servicing advances default servicing, things like that pop up, and so we're managing them in that way.
So I kind of want to get your perspective on how much of that do you think is a reflection of just Â you guys have a lower loss content loans, a better risk profile of it, as opposed to maybe some other more idiosyncratic things as I seem to recall that you've marked some loans in the past that were in recovery positions and stuff like that.
And the allowance if they're to serve both our credit card portfolio, which under most conditions we wish was a bigger capability for Wells Fargo in times like this is a little bit of a saving grace because we expected loss content both in what's outstanding as well as what might be expected to come through from undrawn is more manageable in the size of our balance sheet.
Is that a fair assumption at this point, given the Â given your expectation for the ongoing stress on borrowers et cetera, that we could have incremental builds or do you think the Â we're at an adequate level given the recast of the bank's [ph] book and what you put on this current quarter in terms of where your reserve stands at this point.
In terms of how things have leveled off, the prior question about whether there was window dressing going on through the quarter and where our borrowers wanted to have cash on their balance sheet, certainly possible that that was a part of it.
It seems like expenses in the first quarter came in a bit lower than expected even if we adjust for the deferred comp noise, any outlook that you could provide on cost for the year?
And then a separate question and there was a lot of kind of one off items in the quarter that were due just to where markets were at the end of the quarter or more spreads were, another was the reserve for debt securities, equity impairments and then often has an effectiveness and it was expected to reverse given where markets are, at this point in time or where rates are for the hedging activity.
So criticized loan balances increased about $4 billion in the quarter almost all of it in March.
We're going to stop saying that because now we're early in the cycle and we'll be working with each of you to help understand or answer your questions where we can and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
